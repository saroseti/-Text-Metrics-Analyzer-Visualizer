Preface
In October 2015, the 10th Executive Committee Meeting of the International
Society for Digital Earth (ISDE) was held in Halifax, Canada where I was elected as
the third president of ISDE. I put forward a work plan for my tenure that included a
proposal to publish a manual that would address questions regarding the relevance
of Digital Earth, its future, and its potential to support scientiﬁc development and
societal needs. The Executive Committee approved the proposal, and now, after 4
years and a culmination of efforts from numerous contributors, it is my great
pleasure to present this manuscript, Manual of Digital Earth, for publication and
release. The 1st International Symposium on Digital Earth was held in Beijing on
November 1999, marking the humble beginnings of ISDE’s Symposia 1 year after
Mr. Al Gore famously put forward the concept of Digital Earth. Now, after two
decades, it is a privilege for me to oversee preparations for the 11th International
Symposium on Digital Earth in Florence, Italy, on September 2019.
Over the years, ISDE has successfully hosted 10 International Symposia on
Digital Earth and 7 Digital Earth Summits in 11 countries. ISDE and its journals
International Journal of Digital Earth and Big Earth Data launched in 2008 and
2017, have gained international recognition in academic circles. ISDE has become a
participating member of the Group on Earth Observations and an afﬁliate member
of the International Science Council since 2009 and 2017, respectively. This has
been possible in large part due to its success in organizing intellectual events that
appealed to the interests of researchers and scientists in the realm of Digital Earth.
ISDE has also established a series of national committees and chapters that address
Digital Earth issues. All of these recognitions and achievements have helped to
provide the foundation for Digital Earth by developing numerous data platforms
and research institutions, and by supporting academic meetings, papers, and
monographs that have not only beneﬁted our society but improved our under-
standing of the world and its Earth shaping processes. With great honor, I have the
opportunity to personally experience all the milestone events of Digital Earth
during the past two decades. As a witness, organizer and participant, I have been a
part of Digital Earth and it has become a part of my life.
v
Presently, it is necessary for us to gain a profound understanding and make an
in-depth analysis of the expanding scope of the concept of Digital Earth and the
rapid advancements in Digital Earth technologies, as well as the impacts of Digital
Earth on interdisciplinary science and social progress. As an evolving discipline, we
need to answer the following questions: (1) What is the basic theory of Digital
Earth? (2) What are the key technologies? and (3) What are its main applications?
In terms of its content, we need to understand: (1) What are its core characteristics;
(2) What is the difference between Digital Earth and geospatial technology? and
(3) How does Digital Earth—a frontier interdisciplinary ﬁeld of Earth science,
information science, and space science—promote disciplinary integration and data
sharing? To answer these questions, a focused monograph is necessary and
relevant.
The manual has been designed to be simple yet academic in nature and pro-
fessional in design. The information in the manual is forward-looking and will
prove to be instrumental in developing the future concepts for Digital Earth. It
presents a systematic analysis of the theories, methods, and technical systems of
Digital Earth. It also presents a summary of the key achievements to date and
predicts the likely direction and probable future developments within the discipline.
Broadly, the manual includes information on the following: (1) theories on Digital
Earth, the contents of Digital Earth science, and Digital Earth frameworks and
platforms; (2) Digital Earth system technologies, including data acquisition, man-
agement, processing, mining, visualization, virtual reality, network computing,
spatial data facilities, and information service technologies; (3) applications in
climate change, natural hazards, digital cities, digital heritage, and global sustain-
able development goals of the United Nations; (4) regional applications of Digital
Earth, especially in regions and countries such as Europe, Australia, China, and
Russia; and (5) Digital Earth Education and Ethics and the outlook for the future
development of Digital Earth.
Science and technology are continually involved in the process of development
and innovation. Digital Earth is becoming even more relevant as the world is
undergoing a profound digital revolution. The three frameworks of the United
Nations, including Sustainable Development Goals, Climate Change, and Disaster
Risk Reduction, along with the rise in digital economies have created more of a
need for Digital Earth. The increasing volume of data amassed through Earth
system science and geo-information science are prompting experts to investigate
and experiment with highly automated and intelligent systems in order to extract
information from enormous datasets and to drive future innovative research that
will greatly beneﬁt from developments in Digital Earth technologies and systems.
Frontier technologies such as Internet of Things, big data, artiﬁcial intelligence,
blockchain, and 5G are creating opportunities for the next stage of Digital Earth.
Digital Earth could help bridge the information gap for the general public by
integrating data and information from multiple sources including those from space,
social networks, and economic data. By developing intelligent models and
data-intensive computing algorithms, Digital Earth can generate useful information

Dr. Michael F. Goodchild, and Dr. Alessandro Annoni, who reviewed the manual’s
numerous contributions, the ISDE Council Members for their support, and
Dr. Changlin Wang for his tremendous effort. Particularly, I would like to thank
Dr. Zhen Liu for the work she has done over the past 2 years organizing all aspects
of this publication, which would have been impossible without her efforts. Taking
this opportunity, I would also like to express my appreciation to everybody who has
contributed to Digital Earth. I sincerely wish Digital Earth continued success and
strongly support its vigorous development.

Understanding Digital Earth
Zhen Liu, Tim Foresman, John van Genderen and Lizhe Wang
Abstract In the two decades since the debut of the Digital Earth (DE) vision, a con-
certed international effort has engaged in nurturing the development of a technology
framework and harnessing applications to preserve the planet and sustain human
societies. Evolutionary threads can be traced to key historic and multidisciplinary
foundations, which were presciently articulated and represented at the ﬁrst Inter-
national Symposium on Digital Earth hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences
in 1999. Pioneering groups in government, industry, and academia have cultivated
this fertile futuristic conceptual model with technological incubation and exploratory
applications. An array of space-age developments in computers, the internet and com-
munications, Earth observation satellites, and spatially oriented applications sparked
an innovative discipline. The Beijing Declaration on Digital Earth is recognized for
its role in promulgating the series of International Symposia on Digital Earth to
promote understanding of the impacts of DE technology and applications on behalf
of humankind. Combinations of industrial, academic, and government organizations
have rapidly advanced the technological components necessary for implementing the
DE vision. Commercial leaders such as Google have accelerated the inﬂuence of DE
for large segments of society. Challenges remain regarding requisite collaboration
on international standards to optimize and accelerate DE implementation scenarios.
This chapter provides an overview of the DE initiative and basic framework, the
global response to DE, the evolution of DE, its relationship to key global science
initiatives, and the response to global challenges.

The Digital Earth Initiative
Three years after a human ﬁrst stepped on the moon’s surface, the space and informa-
tion age launched with the Landsat series of Earth observation satellites. Beginning
in 1972, Landsat data kick started the big-data epoch by capturing imagery of the
whole Earth’s surface every two weeks. From these space-age origins, a multitude of
technologies have developed to address data storage, preprocessing, classiﬁcation,
interpretation, analysis, integration with computational models, and visualization
in digital image processing workﬂows. Digital image processing has spread across
science, medical, computer, gaming, and entertainment ﬁelds, creating multitudes
of new industries. With the booming development of Earth observation, considered
the ﬁrst wave of big data, massive amounts of digital data about the Earth’s sur-
face and near-surface have been collected from an ever-growing constellation of
various satellites and sensors. Increased information technology capacity, following
Moore’s Law, has fostered disruptive changes regarding applications of Earth system
data within the scientiﬁc community, relevant industries, and by consumer citizens.
‘Digital’ refers to more than the electronic format of the data in bits and bytes or
the automated workﬂow used to manage the data. The Digital Era encompasses the
much wider and greater societal and technological transformations facing humans.
“Digital Earth is the inevitable outcome of the space era in the history of information
society development” (Chen 2004). Digital Earth captures this phenomenal extension
to harness the ‘digital’ world in which we live.
The concept of Digital Earth, ﬁrst coined in Al Gore’s book entitled “Earth in
the Balance” (Gore 1992), was further developed in a speech written for Gore at
the opening of the California Science Center in 1998. In this speech, Digital Earth
was described as a multiresolution and three-dimensional visual representation of
Earth that would help humankind take advantage of geo-referenced information
on physical and social environments, linked to an interconnected web of digital
libraries (Gore 1999). The concept of Digital Earth was further explained as the use
of “digital technologies to model Earth systems, including cultural and social aspects
represented by human societies living on the planet. The model is a multidimensional,
multiscale, multitemporal, and multilayered information system. Digital Earth is
envisaged as a common platform to support national and international cooperation for
global sustainable development, and a newly developing point of economic growth
and social well-being” (International Society for Digital Earth 2012).
Digital Earth theories and relevant technologies have ﬂourished across a range of
disciplines and applications worldwide (Chen 1999; Goodchild 1999, 2008; Fores-
man 2008; Guo et al. 2009; Annoni et al. 2011; Craglia et al. 2012; Goodchild et al.
2012). This momentous turn in the histories of cartography, meteorology, and geog-
raphy was made feasible by the conﬂuence of enabling information technologies in
1
Understanding Digital Earth

computational science, mass storage, satellite imagery, broadband networks, inter-
operability, metadata, and unprecedented ‘virtual reality’ technologies. Powered by
advances in semiconductor devices networked to telecoms, navigation, and Earth
observation satellites, a new era of spatially enabled technologies transformed and
fused multiple disciplines in the 21st century. As a system of interconnected sys-
tems, Digital Earth should be fully empowered with multiple sources of geospatial
information, a 3D representation platform of the Earth, and a user interface, and act
as the framework that combines these domains. As stated in the Beijing Declaration
on Digital Earth, “Digital Earth is an integral part of other advanced technologies
including: Earth observation, geo-information systems, global positioning systems,
communication networks, sensor webs, electromagnetic identiﬁers, virtual reality,
grid computation, etc.” (International Society for Digital Earth 2009).
In addition to being a global strategic contributor to scientiﬁc and technologi-
cal developments, Digital Earth was regarded as an approach for “addressing the
social, economic, cultural, institutional, scientiﬁc, educational, and technical chal-
lenges, allows humankind to visualize the Earth, and all places within it, to access
information about it and to understand and inﬂuence the social, economic and envi-
ronmental issues that affect their lives in their neighborhoods, their nations and the
planet Earth” (International Society for Digital Earth 1999). It is “a catalyst in ﬁnd-
ing solutions to international scientiﬁc and societal issues” (International Society for
Digital Earth 2009). Contemporary local and global issues can be characterized as
complex and interrelated. Solutions to challenging problems remain elusive under
conventional governance. In this dynamic environment, better methods for organiz-
ing vast data and managing human affairs are sought at all organizational levels.
While not a panacea, Digital Earth has been regarded as the most effective approach,
organizing metaphor, or model, to turn raw and disaggregated data into understand-
able, visualized information to gain knowledge about the Earth and human inﬂuence
(Goodchild et al. 2012). Consequently, it can aid in the sustainable development of
all countries and regions (Chen 2004). Thus, Digital Earth plays “a strategic and
sustainable role in addressing such challenges to human society as natural resource
depletion, food and water insecurity, energy shortages, environmental degradation,
natural disasters response, population explosion, and, in particular, global climate
change” (International Society for Digital Earth 2009).
1.2
Basic Framework of Digital Earth
Digital Earth is described as a virtual globe constructed of massive, multiresolution,
multitemporal, multityped Earth observation data and socioeconomic data combined
with relevant analysis algorithms and models (Goodchild 2013; Grossner et al. 2008).
From a scientiﬁc point of view, the basic implication of Digital Earth includes two
aspects. First, Digital Earth represents a huge data and information system that aggre-
gates and presents data and information related to the Earth. In addition, Digital Earth
4
Z. Liu et al.
is a virtual Earth system that can perform reconﬁgurable system simulations and deci-
sion support for complex geoscience processes and socioeconomic phenomena (Guo
et al. 2014).
1.2.1
Basic Scientiﬁc Problems
The basic scientiﬁc problems concerning Digital Earth comprise three aspects:
(1) How to construct Digital Earth provided that we have massive, multiresolution,
multitemporal, multitype Earth observation data and socioeconomic data? And
how to organize, map, and compute these data to generate the data ecosystem—
a harmonious, multidimensional, multiscale, multitemporal, and multilayered
information system for Digital Earth?
(2) How to discover knowledge in Digital Earth? Assuming a data ecosystem has
been built well, the next task is to compute, analyze, and mine the data for
knowledge discovery to understand the Earth system using physical models
(e.g., climate change models, Earth system models) or artiﬁcial intelligence
algorithms (machine learning, data mining, deep learning, etc.).
(3) How to operate and utilize Digital Earth? As various of types of Digital Earth
exist, coordinating and operating multiple subsystems of a Digital Earth plat-
form to deliver ﬂexible, efﬁcient and user-friendly service for Digital Earth users
and applications is a basic scientiﬁc problem.
1.2.2
Theoretical and Methodological Framework
To target the aforementioned scientiﬁc problems, we need a theoretical and method-
ological framework for Digital Earth:
(1) The theory and methodology of Digital Earth construction and implementation
This task is to generate the data and computer systems to produce a basic platform and
infrastructure for a Digital Earth. The related theories and methods include remote
sensing, geography, cartography, Earth information science, database theory, cloud
computing, information networks, software engineering, and information theory.
(2) The theory and methodology of Digital Earth knowledge discovery
This task is to comprise implementation of the change from data to knowledge to
understand the Earth system, for example, how Earth has changed, what the next
change is and how human activities affect the Earth system. The related theories and
methods include information theory, artiﬁcial intelligence, data mining, and Earth
system science.

(3) The theory and methodology of Digital Earth operation and utilization
This task is to comprise management of the Digital Earth system and a whole and
delivery of services to users and applications. The related theories and methods
includes software engineering, cloud computing, Earth Information science, visual-
ization, and information networking.
1.3
Global Response to Digital Earth
Responding to the vision for Digital Earth, the US government established a NASA-
led Interagency Digital Earth Working Group in 1999 (Foresman 2008). Although
this working group lost momentum and government support after 2001, its inﬂu-
ence remained, with many stakeholders maintaining keen interest in pursuing this
initiative.
1.3.1
International Society for Digital Earth
In 1999, the ﬁrst International Symposium on Digital Earth to promote Digital Earth
asaglobalinitiativewasheldinBeijing,China,sponsoredbytheChinesegovernment
and hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. More than one thousand scientists,
engineers, educators and governors from nearly 40 countries worldwide attended.
The attendees approved a milestone document for the movement, the 1999 Beijing
Declaration on Digital Earth. This symposium laid the foundation for the develop-
ment of Digital Earth at the global scale, and kicked off the worldwide responses to
the Digital Earth initiative.
During the symposium, an International Steering Committee of the International
Symposium on Digital Earth was established to organize subsequent symposia in
the coming years. In 2006, the International Society for Digital Earth (ISDE) was
formally established with the secretariat hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sci-
ences. The ISDE is a nonproﬁt international scientiﬁc organization that principally
coordinates and promotes academic exchange, education, science and technology
innovation, and international collaboration towards Digital Earth.
Following the 1999 symposium, a symposium has been held every two years at
different locations around the world. In addition, since 2006, Digital Earth summits
have been added to the biannual symposia schedule to focus on speciﬁc academic
themes that have been identiﬁed as important. After 20 years of development, ten
symposia and seven summits have been hosted in 11 different countries. The upcom-
ing symposium will be held in Italy in 2019 and the summit will take place in Russia
in 2020.
Important to the professional standing of the ISDE is the addition of an interna-
tional peer-reviewed academic journal, the International Journal of Digital Earth
6
Z. Liu et al.
(IJDE). The highly rated journal is published jointly by the ISDE and the Taylor &
Francis Group. Inaugurated in March 2008, the IJDE was accepted for coverage by
the Science Citation Index. Expanded in August 2009, the journal had an impact
factor of 2.746 in 2018, ranking 13th out of 30 remote sensing journals, and has been
included in 12 large international citation databases.
The Digital Earth initiative ﬁts within many global organizations’ missions
through sharing knowledge and ideas about Digital Earth and seeking global ben-
eﬁts using Digital Earth technology. In 2009, the ISDE joined the Group on Earth
Observations (GEO), the world’s largest intergovernmental organization on using
geospatial data. The ISDE also has established partnerships with the Committee on
Data for Science and Technology (CODATA), the International Eurasian Academy of
Sciences, the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association, and the African Asso-
ciation of Remote Sensing of the Environment. In 2017, the ISDE was recognized as
a member of the International Council for Science (ICSU, now is the International
Science Council). In August 2019, ISDE becomes a member of the United Nations
Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management—Geospa-
tial Societies (UN-GGIM GS). The ISDE is now widely recognized globally as a
leadership organization in geospatial information science research.
1.3.2
Group on Earth Observations’ Membership
In 2005, delegations from nearly 60 countries endorsed a ten-year Implementation
Plan for the 2005–2015 Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and
further established the intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations (GEO) to
implement the plan. The ISDE’s membership in the GEO guarantees organizational
and scientiﬁc harmonization with all major international communities.
One of the GEO’s missions is to implement GEOSS to “better integrate observing
systems and share data by connecting existing infrastructures using common stan-
dards” (https://www.earthobservations.org/geo_community.php). “GEOSS is a set of
coordinated, independent Earth observation, information and processing systems that
interact and provide access to diverse information for a broad range of users in both
public and private sectors. GEOSS links these systems to strengthen the monitoring
of the state of the Earth. It facilitates the sharing of environmental data and informa-
tion collected from the large array of observing systems contributed by countries and
organizations within GEO. Further, GEOSS ensures that these data are accessible,
of identiﬁed quality and provenance, and interoperable to support the development
of tools and the delivery of information services. Thus, GEOSS increases our under-
standing of Earth processes and enhances predictive capabilities that underpin sound
decision making: it provides access to data, information and knowledge to a wide
variety of users” (https://www.earthobservations.org/geoss.php). GEOSS currently
contains more than 400 million open data resources from more than 150 national
and regional providers such as NASA and ESA, international organizations such
1
Understanding Digital Earth
7
as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and groups in the commercial
sector such as Digital Globe (now Maxar) (https://www.earthobservations.org/geo_
community.php).
1.3.3
The Australian Geoscience Data Cube
The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realize the full potential of
Earth observation data holdings by addressing the big data challenges of volume,
velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data.
The AGDC is a collaborative initiative of Geoscience Australia, the National Compu-
tational Infrastructure (NCI), and the Australian Commonwealth Scientiﬁc Industrial
Research Organisation (CSIRO). The AGDC was developed over several years as
researchers sought to maximize the impact of Land surface image archives from Aus-
tralia’s ﬁrst participation in the Landsat program in 1979. There have been several
iterations, and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundation
and core components of the AGDC are (1) data preparation, including geometric and
radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardized surface
reﬂectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection manage-
ment systems that track the provenance of each data cube product and formalize
reprocessing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact
with the data; and (3) the supporting high-performance computing environment pro-
vided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) (Lewis et al.
2017).
A growing number of examples demonstrate that the data cube approach allows for
analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including
through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth
observation archives, such as extracting the intertidal extent and topography of the
Australian coastline from a 28-year time series of Landsat observations. Sagar et al.
outlined an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent and topography
of the Australian coastline that leverages a full time series of Landsat observations
from 1987 to 2015 managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) (Sagar
et al. 2017). The Australian Government established a program to improve access
to ﬂood information across Australia. As part of this, a project was undertaken to
map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multidecadal archive of
Landsat satellite imagery. The “initial scoping of the full processing time required
for the analysis indicated that one analysis of the entire Landsat archive for surface
water was over four years. The analysis as conducted on the AGDC was completed
in under 8 h, making it feasible to review and improve the algorithms, and repeat the
analyses many times, where previously such an analysis was essentially not feasible”
(Mueller et al. 2016).
The AGDC vision is of a ‘Digital Earth’ (Craglia et al. 2012) composed of obser-
vations of the Earth’s oceans, surface and subsurface taken through space and time
and stored in a high-performance computing environment. A fully developed AGDC
8
Z. Liu et al.
wouldallowforgovernments,scientistsandthepublictomonitor,analyzeandproject
the state of the Earth and will realize the full value of large Earth observation datasets
by allowing for rapid and repeatable continental-scale analyses of Earth properties
through space and time. To enable easy uptake of the AGDC and facilitate future
cooperative development, the AGDC code is developed under an open source Apache
License, version 2.0. This open source approach is enabling other organizations
including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) to explore the use of
similar data cubes in developing countries (Lewis et al. 2017). It creates the potential
for expansion of the AGDC concept into a network of data cubes operating on large
geoscientiﬁc and geospatial datasets, colocated in suitable HPC-HPD facilities, to
address global and national challenges.
1.3.4
CASEarth Data Bank
The Earth observation community has entered into the era of big data. The CASEarth
Data Bank, part of the Project on Big Earth Data Science Engineering (Guo 2018),
provides big Earth data infrastructure that focuses on Earth observation data.
With new computing infrastructures, technologies and data architectures, the
CASEarth DataBank system aims to meet the data management and analysis chal-
lenges that arise from the huge increase in satellite Earth observation data. The
CASEarth DataBank system is designed to increase the value and impact of Ready
to Use (RTU) products by providing an open and freely accessible exploitation archi-
tecture to broaden their applications for societal beneﬁt (Guo 2018).
The CASEarth DataBank system is an intelligent data service platform that pro-
vides RTU products from multisource spatial data, especially satellite remote sensing
data, and big Earth data analysis methods and high-performance computing infras-
tructure.
The CASEarth Databank consists of three main parts:
(1) Standardizedlongtime-seriesRTUproductsfromEarthobservationdatainclud-
ing (1) Chinese satellite data: ZY, GF, HJ, CBERS, FY, HY, and CASEarth
satellites, with spatial resolutions from one km to submeter; (2) Landsat data
received by the China Remote Sensing Satellite Ground Station since 1986, with
12 RTU products including digital orthophoto maps, regional image maps, top
of atmosphere reﬂectance, land surface reﬂectance, top of atmosphere bright-
ness temperature, land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation
index, ratio vegetation index, global environment monitoring index, normalized
burnt ratio, normalized difference water index, and pixel quality attribute; and
(3) other big Earth data sources: DEM, vector, and social data (He et al. 2015,
2018a, b). These RTU products provide consistent, standardized, multidecadal
image data for robust land cover change detection and monitoring across the
Earth sciences.

(2) The Software Environment. For the data engine, a databox was developed for
time series data management and global tiling. For the CASEarth Data Bank
system, a global subdivision grid was designed to effectively manage, organize
and use long-term sequential RTU data and facilitate the integration and applica-
tion analysis of multisource and multiscale geospatial information. The global
subdivision grid was designed for RTU data based on the national standard of
China (GB/T 12409-2009) (Guo 2018).
The computation engine consists of time series data analysis, computational
modeling and data integration, middleware and tool modeling, data-intensive
computing technologies, data-driven innovation, advanced manufacturing and
productivity. It provides basic data analysis algorithms, a distributed parallel
computing mechanism, and intelligent analysis solutions for big Earth data.
The visualization engine aids in data visualization in a pictorial or graphical
format. With rich, interactive visuals such as graphs and charts, it is easy to
discover insights hidden in the data due to the way the human brain processes
information. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually. A
visualization engine is being developed to better understand the data in the
CASEarth Databank.
(3) Infrastructure and services. It provides a high-performance computing environ-
ment and services with 50P storage and 2PF computing capability. The infras-
tructures and systems of dataﬁcation for big Earth data include storage, man-
agement, computing, optimizing cloudiﬁcation, architectural features, stateless
processing, microservices, containers, open software and inherent orchestration.
1.4
Evolution of Digital Earth
Fundamental changes in society have occurred since the Digital Earth concept was
proposed 20 years ago. Along with these social changes, technology advances have
been incrementally achieved, resulting in the evolution of Digital Earth.
1.4.1
Visionary Incubation of Digital Earth
Based on command and control technologies, there are several virtual globe plat-
forms, or geobrowsers, with associated visualization applications. Among them, the
three major categories are location-based commercial platforms, science platforms
based on Earth system sciences, and public platforms oriented towards regional sus-
tainable development and decision support (Guo et al. 2017).
In 2001, based on a 3D Earth geographic teaching software ‘Atlas 2000’ by
Microsoft, an original prototype of the Earth system was developed, which integrated
large-scale remote sensing imagery and key point datasets into a global 3D model.
10
Z. Liu et al.
Following that, ESRI launched ArcGIS Explorer, and Google Earth was launched
in 2005. These early geobrowsers were supported by geospatial tessellation engines
operated within desktop computers using 3D technology. When integrated, these
Digital Earth systems allowed for querying, measurement, analysis, and location
services based on massive geospatial data (Grossner and Clarke 2007). Since then, a
number of virtual globes have been produced, including WorldWind, Skyline Globe,
GeoGlobe, and Bing Maps 3D. Keysers (2015) provides comparative descriptions of
23 virtual globes, demonstrating the early breadth of Digital Earth technology. This
implies that the technology of virtual globes is not yet completely mature.
In addition, many other countries’ governments and institutes have produced Dig-
ital Earth platforms for speciﬁc research purposes. The Chinese Academy of Sci-
ences started research on a Digital Earth Prototype System in 1999 and released
the Digital Earth Science Platform (DESP/CAS) in 2010 (Guo et al. 2009). The
Jet Propulsion Laboratory created Eyes on the Earth to visualize in situ data from
a number of NASA’s Earth orbiting spacecraft (NASA 2009). The Australian gov-
ernment explored Blue Link and Glass Earth to observe and simulate the ocean and
explore the top kilometer of the Australian continent’s surface and its geological pro-
cesses. A consortium of Japanese institutes developed the Earth Simulator to support
environmental change research (Yokokawa 2002).
In 2011, a group of experts from the International Society for Digital Earth gath-
ered at the “Digital Earth Vision to 2020” workshop in Beijing to discuss the develop-
ing trends of Digital Earth. This workshop discussed the achievements of Al Gore’s
ﬁrst generation of the Digital Earth vision. Goodchild et al. (2012) indicated that the
existing generation of Digital Earth (or Virtual Globes) represented great progress
in Gore’s vision. In Gore’s vision, 3D representation of the Earth tops the list in
realization of Digital Earth. 3D technology is derived from computer and 3D graphic
technologies supported by the ﬁlm and video game industries and is involved in the
representation of the Earth, hence the name Digital Earth. Digital Earth is regarded
as a “disruptive approach to the methods of geospatial analysis and visualization cur-
rently employed within the ﬁeld of GIS that uses a virtual (3D) representation of the
globe” and as a spatial reference model to visualize, retrieve, and analyze geospatial
data at different levels (Mahdavi-Amiri et al. 2015). Data (including imagery, eleva-
tion data, vector data, 3D geometric data, and statistical data) are mostly assigned
to discretized and hierarchical cells of the Earth, which is a structure known as Dis-
crete Global Grid Systems (DGGSs) that serves as the backbone of the Digital Earth
system (Goodchild 2000; Sahr et al. 2003). The ﬁrst generation of these systems
could also be extended and adapted to different user requirements, i.e., displaying
the oceanography, atmosphere, or geomorphology of the surface and near-surface of
the Earth. However, some aspects fall short of Gore’s vision, such as the exploration
of historical and future scenarios of the Earth, as well as limitations in the storage,
retrieval, and sharing of the huge amount of collected information related to the
Earth, and in visualization of the Earth (Goodchild et al. 2012).

1.4.2
Digital Earth in Support of Data-Intensive Knowledge
Discovery
With the tremendous growth of the geospatial data collected from satellite-based
and ground-based sensors, a fourth paradigm of science was required to characterize
data-intensive knowledge discovery. High-performance computing capacity, inter-
national collaboration, and data-intensive analysis using high-end visualization have
been developed to deal with the multisource data management hurdles. New aware-
ness of the challenges Digital Earth could face has attracted attention to theoretical
and scientiﬁc innovations in data-intensive geoscience knowledge discovery meth-
ods, massive data convergence and service models, and data-intensive geoscience
computing and knowledge discovery (Goodchild 2013).
Various types of observation data represent essential foundations for the develop-
ment of Digital Earth. Massive amounts of geospatial data including satellite-borne
data are being processed, exploited and combined with other massive data sources,
and delivered in near-real time to users in highly integrated information products. In
thecontext of thewidespreaduseof massivegeospatial data, Digital Earthprototypes,
popularly represented by Google Earth, began to use the internet to provide the world
with high-resolution digital rendering services beginning in 2005. Google’s game-
changing Earth tessellation engine enabled the public to realize free and convenient
access to conduct geo-spatial inquiry and mapping operations on Earth-related data
using their personal computers (Goodchild 2013). The challenges inherent in inten-
sive data provide Digital Earth an opportunity to play a signiﬁcant role in scientiﬁc
knowledge discovery.
1.4.3
Digital Earth with Multisource Data
As a complex system, Digital Earth increasingly embraces massive multi-resolution,
multitemporal and multitype Earth observation data and socioeconomic data as well
as relevant analysis algorithms and models (Guo 2012; Grossner et al. 2008). Data
acquisition, organization, analysis and application all reﬂect the importance and
necessity of effectively handling massive volumes of scientiﬁc data. With the rapid
development of internet, mobile 5G network, and Web 2.0 technologies, signiﬁcant
improvements occurred in the collection of multisource spatial data. The availability
of data providers is increasing as digital citizens are no longer limited to govern-
ment agencies or professional companies. Ordinary civilian users can participate in
and cooperate with others to maintain and update geographic information data. The
idea that everyone can serve as a data collection sensor has become a reality. Good-
child (2007) termed this new geographical era neogeography. New sources of data
from both citizen science and smartphone activity enable the public to become mass
providers of data. Concepts that embrace this new public data collection, such as vol-
unteered geographic information (VGI) (Goodchild 2007), crowdsourcing geospatial
12
Z. Liu et al.
data (Giles 2006; Howe 2006; Heipke 2010), and generalized geographic informa-
tion (Lu and Zhang 2014), have been highlighted. Although the concepts vary, all of
them emphasize the transformation of geospatial data acquisition. The bottlenecks
in acquisition due to reliance on traditional, professional or government mapping
have been uncorked using diversiﬁed and increasingly accurate active or passive
data provided by the public.
The aforementioned “Digital Earth Vision to 2020” workshop led to two scientiﬁc
papers: Next-Generation Digital Earth published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) (Goodchild et al. 2012)
and Digital Earth 2020: Towards the Vision for the Next Decade published in the
International Journal of Digital Earth (IJDE) (Craglia et al. 2012). Goodchild et al.
(2012) proposed that inevitable new developments in internet communications and
API services, multidimensional representation, and Earth observation visualization
technologies would accelerate fulﬁllment of the Digital Earth concept and expand the
potential of Digital Earth for all stakeholders. The next generation of Digital Earth
is not projected to be a single system and will likely be multiple interconnected
infrastructures based on professional standards for open access and horizontal par-
ticipation across multiple technological platforms. Client-friendly and customized
platforms will drive the growth of different audiences. One metaphor proposed Dig-
ital Earth as a digital nervous system for the globe, actively informing users about
events happening on or near the Earth’s surface by connecting to sensor networks
and situation-aware systems (Foresman 2010). de Longueville et al. (2010) believed
that Digital Earth is a powerful metaphor for accessing the multiscale 3D represen-
tation of the globe but, due to its non-self-aware feature, the inclusion of temporal
and voluntary dimensions would be more helpful in a description of the real world.
Craglia et al. (2012) articulated the main policy, scientiﬁc and societal drivers for the
development of Digital Earth. These papers help illustrate the multifaceted nature of
next-generation Digital Earth. The growth of Digital Earth is predicated in part on
emphasizing its usefulness to the public. Continued development and evolution of
internet bandwidth and improved visualization techniques can be expected to main-
tain the growth of Digital Earth applications. Equally important for public appli-
cations are social developments and the widespread adoption of social networks,
which serve as key ways to communicate and turn citizens into force multipliers as
providers of information.
1.4.4
Digital Earth in Big Data Era
Entering the big data era, national and regional governments responded by releas-
ing relevant strategies accordingly. For example, in 2011 the European Commis-
sion announced a statement on “Open Data: An Engine for Innovation, Growth
and Transparent Governance”. In 2012, the United States released the “Big Data
Research and Development Initiative” to enhance the capability of knowledge dis-
covery through big data (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/ﬁles/microsites/
1
Understanding Digital Earth
13
ostp/big_data_fact_sheet_ﬁnal_1.pdf). Australia published “The Australian Public
Service Big Data Strategy” in 2013. Subsequently, the Chinese government began
emphasizing big data as one of the strategic resources of social development in
2013 and issued the “The Action Plan for Promoting Big Data Development” in
2015, including a proposal for “Developing Science Big Data”. In 2012, the UN
Global Pulse published “Big Data for Development: Opportunities and Challenges”
to promote the signiﬁcant role of big data in responding to climate changes. The
International Council for Science (joined in 2017 with the International Social Sci-
ence Council to form the International Sciences Council) published their “Strategic
Plan 2012–2017”, which emphasized the importance of data management in new
knowledge discovery.
Big data has created a new computational perspective in the use of continuously
collected data from various sources to explore trends in large volumes of data and
to better understand world dynamics. Such advances bring great opportunities for
Digital Earth to play its visionary role in integrating the massive amount of multi-
dimensional, multitemporal, and multiresolution geospatial data as well as socioe-
conomic data in a framework for comprehensive analysis and application systems
about the Earth.
Digital Earth has evolved into a new connotation of ‘big Earth data’. Big Earth data
incorporates the litany of powerful tools requisite to understanding and explaining
the Earth system and to investigating sustainable global development. It focuses on
the synthesis and systematic observation of Earth, as well as data-intensive methods
for studying Earth system models with the goal of increasing knowledge discovery.
Big Earth data can be expected to promote the Digital Earth vision by connecting
multiple satellites and geographical information centers that rely on national spatial
infrastructures and high-speed internet to complete the acquisition, transmission,
storage, processing, analysis, and distribution of spatial data.
1.5
Relationship with Other Initiatives
1.5.1
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
The United States pioneered the development and implementation of the National
Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) in the 1990s. Clearly deﬁned, the NSDI is the
sum of the technologies, policies, standards, human resources, and related activities
necessary to collect, process, publish, use, maintain, and manage geospatial data
from all levels of government, private and nonproﬁt organizations, and academic
communities.TheNSDImakesexistingandaccurategeospatialdatamoreaccessible,
greatly facilitates the collection, sharing, distribution and utilization of geospatial
data, and has played an active role in economic growth, environmental quality and
protection, and social progress in the United States.
14
Z. Liu et al.
The NSDI model has been accepted and adopted to ﬁt the needs of many other
countries that have implemented their own spatial data infrastructure plans. The fed-
eral government of Canada implemented the GeoConnections program in 1999, a
national program of partnerships involving the federal government, provincial (dis-
trict)governments,municipalandlocalgovernments,researchinstitutes,universities,
and private companies. The main role of GeoConnections is to establish the Canadian
Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) and enable online access to Canadian geospa-
tial databases and services. The CGDI is the sum of the policies, technologies, stan-
dards, access systems and protocols necessary to coordinate all geospatial databases
in Canada and make them available on the internet. For more than a decade, the
implementation of GeoConnections has enabled online access to Canadian geospa-
tial databases and services, and effectively coordinated partnerships, investments and
developments between federal, provincial, local government, private and academic
communities.
In 2007, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) Direc-
tive came into force (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/about-inspire/563). This directive
established a web-based infrastructure to make more visible, shareable and usable
environmental and geospatial information necessary to support European environ-
mental policies that affect the environment such as transport, agriculture, and marine
policy. INSPIRE is decentralized, i.e., the infrastructure builds on those set up and
maintained by the 28 EU member states. It does not require the collection of new
data and develops the technical, and organizational arrangements to achieve inter-
operability among the infrastructures in the member states and among the 34 data
themes falling in the scope of the directive. INSPIRE will take more than 12 years
to implement, from 2007 when the directive was adopted to 2019–20 and beyond.
As this process takes place, it is important to consider the technological and policy
developments that will shape the future data infrastructures so that the investments
of today are open to the developments of tomorrow.

Earth observation has been become a major part of many countries’ environmental
and defense programs since the ﬁnal decades of the last century. Nations were inﬂu-
enced by the Planetary Mission of NASA’s Earth Observation Program. The program
was developed for the scientiﬁc research of the Earth systems. Its goals were to col-
lect sufﬁcient data on the Earth’s systems to enable whole planetary assessments and
conduct comprehensive research on the Earth. NASA’s program consists of three
parts: the scientiﬁc plan, Earth observation platforms, and data information systems.
A new generation of space-Earth observation continues and has been extended to
incorporate observations of the land, atmosphere, ocean, ecosystem processes, water
and energy cycles, and solid Earth.

The Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) program was
jointly established by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Com-
mission in 2003. The ESA created a series of next-generation Earth observation
missions, including the Copernicus program. To meet the operational needs of the
Copernicus program, the ESA developed the Sentinel program to replace older Earth
observation missions. Each Sentinel mission is based on a paired satellite model to
provide datasets for Copernicus Services and focuses on different aspects of Earth
observation, including atmospheric, oceanic, and land monitoring.
Earth observations have expanded rapidly around the globe, as demonstrated by
the fact that the GEO now has more than 100 member nations. Bringing Earth obser-
vation down to Earth with an ever-increasing number of Earth observation satellites
with increasing spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions represents a critical data
input to the Digital Earth concept.
1.5.3
National/Regional Digital Earth Programs
Dozens of countries such as Australia, China, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, and
the European Commission have generated their own Digital Earth-related programs.
There has been important progress in these efforts, such as Digital Earth Australia
established by the Australia federal government in 2017, the Geoscience Australia
Data Cube (supported by the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research
Organization, the National Computational Infrastructure, and the National Collab-
orative Research Infrastructure Strategy of Australia), Digital China promoted by
the Chinese government, the Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Sciences established
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the IDEAS (International Digital Earth
Applied Science Research Center) at Chubu University in Japan, as well as those at
several universities with Digital Earth departments or laboratories (e.g., Austria and
Malaysia). Some of these are described in detail in Part III of this manual.

Digital Earth in Response to Global Challenges
Correlated with and a derivative of many sciences dealing with the surface and near-
surface of the Earth, Digital Earth was envisioned as an initiative for harnessing the
Earth’s data and information resources. With powerful tools to quantitatively describe
a science-based representation of the planet, Digital Earth could serve as a tool to
map, monitor, measure, and forecast natural and human activities. The prowess of the
Digital Earth technology was envisioned as requisite to assist nations, organizations,
and individual citizens in addressing the problems humans are facing in the 21st cen-
tury. These challenges for all nations, such as climate change, natural disasters, and
sustainable development, require the comprehensive scope and analytical capacity
of Digital Earth technology.

1.6.1
Response to Climate Change
Since the middle of the 20th century, large-scale, high-intensity human activities
and the rapid growth of the population and social economy have compounded global
changeproblemssuchasglobalwarming,airpollution,waterpollution,landdegrada-
tion, rapacious resource exploitation, and biodiversity decline. Global change threat-
ens national security and all aspects of our lives, including economic and social
development conditions from social, economic, living, and health perspectives. Sus-
tainable development is now recognized as the most serious challenge facing human
society.
The United Nations, in partnership with various intergovernmental coalitions, has
organized and implemented a series of environmental research programs on global
or regional scales, such as the World Climate Programme (WCP), the Man and the
Biosphere Programme (MAB), and the International Biosphere Programme (IBP).
Within the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP), each country is
challenged to address the natural resource and environmental issues caused by global
change as a primary means to achieve sustainable approaches for socioeconomic
development.
Global change is recognized as a signiﬁcant threat to sustainable development
worldwide. To address these multidisciplinary issues at a global scale, global change
research faces the unpredicted challenge of obtaining copious data from the inter-
acting subsystems of the Earth for analytical modeling and generating management
decisions (Chen 1999; Shupeng and van Genderen 2008). Thus, it is important that
Digital Earth facilitates the collection of data from various elements of the Earth
system through monitoring the progress of global change in large-scale, long-term
sequences, and aids in data processing, analysis, and simulation.
The Paris Agreement, which was negotiated by representatives of 196 countries,
was endorsed at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in LeBourget, France on 12 December
2015. The Paris Agreement’s long-term goal is to “strengthen the global response
to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century
well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit
the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.” The agreement states
the need to “strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate
change” as well as reduce the risks and effects of climate change (https://unfccc.int/
process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement). Under this agree-
ment, starting in the year 2020, a litany of ﬁnancial policies and new technology
frameworks will be put into action to support the realization of greenhouse gas emis-
sion mitigation, adaptation, and ﬁnance. Increasingly, scientists are documenting that
the impacts of temperature increases in the polar regions indicate that our collective
actions may be too little, too late.
Big Earth data should provide a wide range of long-term sequences and multi-
ple spatiotemporal scales to cover all of Earth’s systems including the atmosphere,
cryosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. To stock Digital Earth with big
1

Earth data requires the only known science approach, which is to amass a space-air-
ground integrated Earth observation system and a global near-real time, all-weather
Earth data acquisition network. Through continuous and long-term monitoring of
the Earth system, scientists can use advanced geospatial processing technologies to
simulate and analyze Earth’s dynamic surface processes and reveal spatiotemporal
change mechanisms. Stakeholders will need to formulate scientiﬁc strategies and
take progressive actions to respond to global change for sustainable development
at varying local and regional scales. In this sense, big Earth data provides strong
support to the Digital Earth vision, which will hopefully strengthen new approaches
to global change research.
1.6.2
Response to the UN SDGs
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted “Transforming
our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (United Nations 2015).
This international milestone provides a blueprint for action for all countries and
stakeholders. This agenda deﬁnes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
169 targets and creates a global indicator framework until 2030. The 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development provides a new insight into the global actions and transfor-
mative policies necessary to guide our collective pursuit of sustainable development.
Achieving sustainable development presents all countries with a set of signiﬁcant
development challenges. These challenges are inherently embedded with spatial-
temporal complexities, that is, they are almost entirely geographic in nature. Many
of the structural issues impacting sustainable development goals can be analyzed,
modeled, and mapped using Earth observation data, which can provide the integra-
tive and quantitative framework necessary for global collaboration, consensus and
evidence-based decision making.
Digital Earth is closely interrelated with the global sustainable development chal-
lenges and processes, as evidenced through national Earth observation agencies’
efforts to connect and integrate big Earth data into the application of many social and
environmental programs. Earth observation data provide a substantial contribution to
the achievements of the SDGs in support of decision making by monitoring impacts
and results, improving the standardization of national statistics, addressing cross-
cutting themes such as climate and energy, and facilitating countries’ approaches to
working across different development sectors (Anderson et al. 2017).
At the United Nations World Geospatial Information Congress (UNWGIC) held
in Deqing, Zhejiang Province in China from 19 to 21 November 2018, attention was
paid to strengthening national geospatial information management and systems and
national implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (https://
www.unwgic2018.org/). It has become important to the science and governance
communities to understand, analyze and discover knowledge from huge geospatial
data resources. This must be accomplished in a collaborative way among nations to
18
Z. Liu et al.
effectively address local, regional, and global challenges and to share big Earth data
worldwide as prerequisites to meet the requirements of sustainable development.
Effective transfer of all relevant technologies and Earth-related data represents an
important challenge (Scott and Rajabifard 2017). However, under the Digital Earth
framework, there are immense opportunities for digital transformation and sharing
of resources. Achieving sustainable development will entail signiﬁcant advances in
overcoming political and technical bottlenecks to smooth the digital divide. Internet-

Digital Earth technologies to all nations.
1.6.3
Response to Disaster Mitigation
Addressing natural and human-caused disasters remains the highest priority of all
nations. Climate change experts are in agreement that global warming will increase
the frequency and intensity of storms and disruptive weather patterns. Therefore,
application of the Digital Earth framework and technology for disaster response and
mitigation is of paramount importance.
Recently, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 (Sendai
Framework) was adopted by the UN member states in March 2015 at the World Con-
ference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai, Japan, and endorsed by the full
UN General Assembly in June 2015. This 15-year development framework agenda
contains seven targets and four priorities for action. The United Nations Interna-
tional Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) has been tasked with supporting
the implementation, follow-up and review of the Sendai Framework. The frame-
work’s central aim is to “reduce disaster risk… and losses in lives, livelihoods and
health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of per-
sons, businesses, communities and countries” with the efforts of local governments,
the private sector and other stakeholders within a voluntary, nonbinding agreement
(https://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/sendai-framework).
Notably, disaster-related applications have been prominent since the inception of
the Digital Earth community. Chen’s (2004) comprehensive review of Digital Earth
science in China includes examples of research on ﬂood, coastal, river, and other
disasters. The International Society for Digital Earth has sponsored or cosponsored
many disaster-oriented workshops and symposia. Importantly, the collaboration with
UNISDR, GEO and CODATA and other international associations has been anchored
by the common commitment to collaboration and focus on applications for disaster
response. Chapter 15 addresses these applications.

Conclusions/Structure of the Manual
In this manual, the Digital Earth vision has been introduced in the ﬁrst chapter. Part
I has eleven chapters about various Digital Earth technologies; Part II has seven
chapters describing the role of Digital Earth in multidomain applications; and Part
III contains four chapters showing how the Digital Earth concept has developed from
Al Gore’s original vision to its current implementation as employed around the world
through four regional/national chapters of the International Society for Digital Earth.
Part IV considers Digital Earth education and ethics. The concluding chapter of this
Manual of Digital Earth describes some of the key challenges and future trends for
the development of Digital Earth over the coming years.
Digital Earth is an evolving concept that is strongly inﬂuenced by the evolution
of technology and the availability of new data. In a couple of years, the Earth will
be revisited several times a day by the new generation of satellites, and real-time
observation will no longer be a chimera. As we look to the future, it is unlikely that
a uniﬁed vision of Digital Earth will capture all the perspectives of all stakeholders.
A one-size-ﬁts-all Digital Earth would not be appropriate for all nations and cultures.
The current social and technological trends expressed in the literature prescribe a
robust and comprehensive list of likely characteristics for an updated version for
Digital Earth, which closely follows the original vision. There will be a series of
connected perspectives of Digital Earth based on varying priorities and applications
of the same framework data sources operating with different user-speciﬁed function-
alities. In the future, the concept and vision of Digital Earth will evolve with the
development of science and technology.

Abstract In this chapter, we provide a thorough discussion on Digital Earth with
particular focus on Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), which are a standardized
representation of the Earth. We describe the necessary components of a DGGS, such
as the underlying 2D representation, indexing system, projection, and cell types. We
also discuss a selection of well-known public and commercial DGGSs followed by
current DGGS standards.

Introduction
Digital Earth is a framework for geospatial data management. In this model, data are
assigned to locations on a 3D model of the Earth and analyzed at multiple resolutions,
each representing data at a speciﬁc level of detail. To locate and retrieve data sets
associated with the Earth, mechanisms are needed for data representation, region
addressing, and the assignment and retrieval of data for a region of interest. Digital
Earth provides a reference model that can handle all of these queries.

T. Alderson et al.
Two main approaches have arisen for the creation of a Digital Earth: Discrete
Global Grid Systems (or DGGSs for short), and datacubes. In a DGGS, the surface
of the Earth is discretized into a set of highly regular spherical/ellipsoidal cells. These
cells are then addressed using a data structure or indexing mechanism that is used
to assign and retrieve data. Datacubes are n-dimensional arrays that store geospatial
data, ordered according to various attribute/coordinate axes, which can be spatial or
non-spatial in nature.
In this chapter, we focus particularly on Discrete Global Grid Systems, which
have global scope, more readily support interoperability than datacubes, are generally
compatible with conventional datacube approaches, and can be used to provide the
back-end support for a datacube implementation (Purss et al. 2019). The following
section discusses DGGS as well as its components and their characteristics in detail.
2.2
Discrete Global Grid Systems
The traditional approach to discretizing the Earth is to use a latitude/longitude coor-
dinate system on a sphere (Cozzi and Ring 2011), in which the 2D domain (or
planar map of the Earth) is partitioned into a grid of cells by discretizing the 2D
latitude/longitude domain. These cells may be further subdivided to increase the res-
olution and mapped to the sphere through the use of spherical coordinate equations
and/or an appropriate spatial projection. The resulting spherical cells are primarily
quadrilateral, though singularities and triangular cells appear at the poles, and the
areas of the cells vary according to the latitude.
In order to better represent the Earth with more uniform cell structures, a polyhe-
dron with the same topology as the sphere can be used. With an initial discretization
of the Earth into planar cells (typically produced by considering the planar faces of an
approximating polyhedron), the initial cells may then be reﬁned to an arbitrary res-
olution and mapped from planar cells to spherical cells via some projection method
(see Fig. 2.1). Given a regular reﬁnement, a multiresolution hierarchy between cells
(in which each cell has a coarser resolution parent and a number of ﬁner resolution
Fig. 2.1 An initial polyhedron that has been reﬁned and projected onto the sphere
2
Digital Earth Platforms
27
children) with a semiregular cell structure can be systematically deﬁned. To query
and render cells, they are then typically addressed via an indexing mechanism.
DGGSs are deﬁned in terms of several different components. The main compo-
nents of a DGGS include the initial planar or piecewise domain, cell type, projection,
indexing, and reﬁnement. In the following, we discuss each of these components in
more detail in the context of DGGS construction.
2.2.1
Initial Domain
ThesimplestdomainforaDGGSisa2DmapoftheEarth,ofwhichlatitude/longitude
grids are the standard. As these tend to exhibit large distortions across the globe
and singularities at the poles, complicating queries and data analysis, a spherical
polyhedron can instead be used for the initial domain of a DGGS. Such DGGSs are
also known as Geodesic DGGSs (Sahr et al. 2003).
The most common choices for an initial polyhedron are the platonic solids—the
tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron—in addition to the
truncated icosahedron. Each of these polyhedra offers distinct beneﬁts. For instance,
the octahedron deﬁnes a simple and symmetric domain, and can be unfolded into
a very simple quadrilateral domain. Cubes are made of quadrilateral facets that are
appropriateforthegenerationofquadrilateralcells.Incomparisontootherpolyhedra,
the icosahedron and truncated icosahedron undergo less angular distortion when
processed through an equal area projection (Snyder 1992).
2.2.2
Cell Type
There are three main cell types that are used in a DGGS: hexagonal, triangular, and
quadrilateral. If the initial domain is a polyhedron, other extraordinary cell types
may be present, such as pentagons in a truncated icosahedron. However, the number
of extraordinary cells is ﬁxed no matter the resolution. Each of the three main cell
types presents some advantages over the others that ought to be considered when
selecting the base cell of a DGGS. For instance, quadrilateral cells are congruent,
compatible with Cartesian coordinate systems, easy to index, and compatible with
standard rendering libraries. Triangular cells are planar, easy to use, compatible
with standard rendering techniques and libraries, and congruent. Hexagonal cells are
the best for sampling, with the smallest quantization error, and they have uniform
adjacency. Depending on the initial domain of a DGGS and the application that the
DGGS was designed for, any of these types of cells can be employed as the DGGS
cell type.
28
T. Alderson et al.
2.2.3
Reﬁnement
Reﬁnements are used to produce ﬁner cells from an initial set of coarse cells. In a
DGGS, they can be used to construct cells at multiple resolutions on the sphere by
reﬁning the faces of a polyhedron. Reﬁnements are in part characterized by a ratio
known as the aperture, or factor, of the reﬁnement. This ratio relates the number of
coarse cells to the number of ﬁne cells at the next resolution, and several different
apertures have been employed in DGGSs. After applying a reﬁnement, the resulting
ﬁne cells may be assigned to a coarse parent cell as children of that cell, producing a
hierarchical structure that is useful for many grid and spatial processing operations.
Traversing from a parent cell to its children or from a child to its parent is known as
hierarchical traversal.
In addition to the factor of reﬁnement, other aspects play an important role in char-
acterizingareﬁnement,suchascongruencyandalignment.Inacongruentreﬁnement,
a coarse cell encompasses precisely the same area as a union of ﬁner cells at the next
resolution (see Fig. 2.2). For example, the 1-to-4 quadrilateral reﬁnement shown in
Fig. 2.2a is congruent while the 1-to-3 hexagonal reﬁnement shown in Fig. 2.3b is
not. Assigning a set of ﬁne cells to serve as the children of a coarse cell is trivial
in congruent reﬁnements, as children are uniquely covered by a single parent cell
and, therefore, the handling of hierarchical traversal queries is simpliﬁed. In contrast,

incongruent reﬁnements create ambiguity in the assignment of a child to a coarse
cell, since there may exist several potential parents for a ﬁne cell (Fig. 2.3).
If, after applying a reﬁnement, every coarse cell shares its centroid with a ﬁne
cell, then that reﬁnement is called center-aligned. Any DGGSs that employ such
reﬁnements are likewise called center-aligned. If such a property does not hold for
the reﬁnement, then it is usually vertex-aligned, meaning that the parent and child
cells share a vertex (Fig. 2.2).
Various types of reﬁnements exist for quadrilateral, triangular, and hexagonal
DGGS cells. However, whereas many different reﬁnements have been employed in
DGGSs based on quadrilateral and hexagonal cells, DGGSs represented using trian-
gular cells generally use 1-to-4 reﬁnements (see Fig. 2.2d). Quadrilateral reﬁnements
canbecongruentwhilsthexagonalreﬁnementsneverare(seeFig.2.3).Consequently,
parent-child relationships must always be explicitly deﬁned in a hexagonal DGGS.
However, once deﬁned, this becomes a static feature of the DGGS infrastructure,
allowing for consistent hierarchical traversal of the grid system, and incongruent
reﬁnements still exhibit characteristics that can be useful in a DGGS. Hexagonal 1-
to-3 reﬁnement has the lowest aperture of all hexagonal reﬁnements; while hexagonal
1-to-4 reﬁnement produces rotation-free lattices at all levels of resolution (simplify-
ing hierarchical analysis in contrast to other reﬁnements). Of the reﬁnements shown
in Fig. 2.3, ﬁne cells in the 1-to-7 reﬁnement cover the hexagonal coarse shape better
than other reﬁnements, and therefore more closely resemble congruency and provide
a simpler hierarchical relationship between the cells. As a result, there is growing
interest in this type of reﬁnement (Middleton and Sivaswamy 2005).

Projection
Projections have traditionally been used to create maps of the Earth. Various forms
of projection can be used to ﬂatten the Earth (usually treated as spherical), and
these can be categorized into different types, such as conformal, gnomonic, or equal
area (Grafarend et al. 2014). When a spherical projection is used, some unavoidable
distortions appear that one may try to reduce. In the following, we discuss several
spherical projections in more detail.
2.2.4.1
Traditional Cartography
In traditional cartography, a spherical projection is a transformation from a point on
the Earth (a sphere) to a point on a 2D map. Such a projection can be represented
as a function: P′ = F−1(P), where P lies on the sphere, and P′ lies on the 2D
map (see Fig. 2.4). The simplest method that can be used to create a 2D map from a
spherical representation of the Earth is to use spherical coordinates ((θ, ϕ)). Doing
so involves cutting the Earth (e.g. along a meridian) and unfolding it to form a 2D
square, with θ (the longitude) and ϕ (the latitude) serving as the two main axes of

where R is the radius of the sphere: R =

x2 + y2 + z2.
As can be observed from Fig. 2.4, perfect squares on the 2D domain are mapped to
distorted quadrilateral or even triangular cells (at the poles) on the sphere. In order to
reduce different distortions, it is possible to deﬁne alternative mappings, which can be
equal-area, conformal (angle-preserving), or possibly stretch-preserving. Since the
purpose of a DGGS is to use planar or piece-wise planar (i.e. polyhedral) domains to
sample the spherical surface of the Earth, the use of an equal-area projection (in which
datavaluessampledfromtheEarthoccupysimilarareasintheDGGS)isoftendesired
(White et al. 1992). Here, we describe some of the most commonly used equal-area
projections. There are several traditional options, such as the projections proposed by
Lambert (cylindrical and azimuthal), Mollweide, and Werner (see Fig. 2.5) (Snyder
1992).
Among these projections, the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection is partic-
ularly interesting, since it serves as the base projection for a number of equal-area
polyhedral projections. In this projection, a point P on the sphere S is projected to
a point P′ on the 2D domain (2D map). To ﬁnd P′, a plane ρ which is tangent to S
at another point C is used. Then, P′ is the intersection of ρ with a circle that has its
origin at C, passes through P, and is perpendicular to ρ (see Fig. 2.6). Note that the
antipode of C (i.e. the point diametrically opposite C) is excluded from the projection
as its intersecting circle is not unique. In addition, C is projected to itself along a
circle of radius 0. This projection and its inverse can be explicitly described using
simple mappings:

2.2.4.2
Projection for Polyhedral Globes
A projection deﬁned for a given polyhedron is characterized by a function F that
maps each point P on the sphere to a face of the polyhedron. Consequently F−1
is deﬁned as a function that maps points on the polyhedron to the sphere. Often,
in order to construct these projections, a traditional projection deﬁned between the
sphere and a plane is used individually on each face. For instance, Snyder’s equal-
area projection (which is commonly used in DGGSs) employs Lambert azimuthal
equal-area projection individually for each face. The problem is reduced to projection
for right triangles by splitting the faces of the polyhedron along lines of symmetry
(see Fig. 2.7). A scaling factor is then found between the radii of two spheres: one
with the same area as the (spherical) polyhedron, and another that circumscribes the
polyhedron. Finally, a triangle on the polyhedron (whose area matches that of the
corresponding spherical triangle that encompasses point P) is generated. The ﬁnal
equation for Snyder’s projection is presented in closed form as:
x = ρsin(Az′),
y = ρcos(Az′),
in which the ratio ρ and angle Az′ are deﬁned in terms of a set of trigonometric
functions and known constants that are provided in (Snyder 1992).
While the forward form of the Snyder projection is presented in a simple closed
form, its inverse calculation requires ﬁnding the roots of a nonlinear equation (Snyder
1992).SnydersuggeststheuseoftheNewton-Raphsoniterativetechniquetocompute
the inverse projection, which can slow down the process of mapping points from the
polyhedron to the sphere. To reduce this inefﬁciency, Harrison et al. (Harrison et al.
2011, 2012) worked to optimize the inverse Snyder projection by providing initial
estimates to the Newton-Raphson technique that are close to the roots of the nonlinear

on right triangles by splitting the initial triangles. Each spherical triangle is associated with a triangle

equation. These initial estimates are found using a polynomial curve that ﬁts the roots
of the non-linear equation.
In addition to Snyder’s projection, other types of equal-area projection have also
been used in DGGSs. For instance, Ro¸sca and Plonka’s projection (Ro¸sca and Plonka
2011) was used in the one-to-two Digital Earth, which is a cube-based Digital Earth
(Mahdavi-Amiri et al. 2013), and extended to the octahedron in (Ro¸sca and Plonka
2012). This equal-area projection describes a mapping from a cubic domain  to a
spherical domain . The main idea behind this projection is to map each face f of
 onto a partition of . To this end, an intermediate domain, called a curved square,
is used. As a result, the projection involves two steps. First, f is mapped to a curved
square on the tangent plane of , parallel to f , using an equal-area bijection denoted
by T . Then, the curved square is mapped to a partition of  using inverse Lambert
azimuthal equal-area projection, denoted by F−1 (Fig. 2.8).
HEALPix (see Fig. 2.9) is also a cube-based equal-area projection, and is a
hybridprojectionofLambertcylindricalequal-areaprojectionandCollignonpseudo-
cylindrical equal-area projection (Gorski et al. 2005). Lambert cylindrical projection
is used for equatorial regions of the Earth while Collignon is used for the polar
regions.
These equal-area projections are not the only projections that can be used in
a DGGS but are examples of projections that have been used already. Naturally, a

2.2.5
Indexing
In order for a Digital Earth to handle queries related to location-based data efﬁciently,
a hierarchical approach to data storage is needed. Hierarchical data structures such as
quadtrees have been used in various Digital Earth frameworks (Fekete and Treinish
1990; Tobler and Chen 1986), but are typically shelved in favor of indexing methods
in order to avoid the cost of expensive tree structures that record node dependencies.
Given an indexing method for a DGGS, the method must ensure that, at each reso-
lution, each cell receives an index that uniquely identiﬁes the cell. This index may
then be used with reference to a data structure or database in order to retrieve data
associated with the cell.
Although various types of methods exist to index the cells of a DGGS, they
are typically derived from three types of general indexing mechanisms: hierarchy-
based, space-ﬁlling curve-based, and axes-based. In the following, we describe each
category and provide some examples.
2.2.5.1
Hierarchy-Based Indexing
Applying reﬁnements to a polyhedron produces a hierarchy that can be used to index
cells. When a reﬁnement is applied to a set of coarse cells, ﬁne cells are created and
assigned to coarse cells through a parent-child relationship. It is possible to use this
relationship to deﬁne an indexing system by assigning an initial index to each cell
at the ﬁrst (i.e. lowest) resolution, and then using each cell’s index as a preﬁx to the
indices of its children. Formally, if a coarse cell has index Id0d1 . . . dr−1, then its
children receive indices of the form Id0d1 . . . dr−1dr, where dr is an integer whose
range is known as the base of the indexing method, denoted by b (i.e. di ∈[0, b−1]).
The base is used to deﬁne algebraic operations on indices, such as conversion
to and from the Cartesian coordinate system, or neighborhood ﬁnding (Tobler and
Chen 1986; Vince and Zheng 2009). Hierarchy-based indexing is very efﬁcient in
supporting hierarchical queries, although neighborhood-ﬁnding tasks may require
complex algorithms, depending on the base of the indexing method and the algebra
deﬁned for the indexing system. An example of this type of indexing was proposed
in (Gargantin 1982) for quadrilateral cells resulting from 1-to-4 reﬁnement (see
Fig. 2.10). Here, the children resulting from 1-to-4 reﬁnement on a quadrilateral
with index I receive indices I0, I1, I2, I3.

2.2.5.2
Space-Filling Curve Indexing
Another method for indexing cells in a DGGS is to use a space-ﬁlling curve (SFC)
as a reference for the indexing (Mahdavi-Amiri et al. 2015b). SFCs have been used
in many applications, such as compression, rendering, and database management,
and are 1D curves (often recursively deﬁned) that cover a particular space.
Recursively deﬁned SFCs start from a simple initial geometry deﬁned on a simple
domain (usually a square). The domain is then reﬁned and the simple geometry is
repetitively transformed to cover the entire reﬁned domain. Typically, if the initial
geometry covers i cells, a 1-to-i reﬁnement is suitable for use in generating a reﬁned
domain. In this way, each SFC is associated with a reﬁnement. To index cells based
on an SFC, decimal numbers can be employed, though the corresponding indices
do not directly encode the resolution. To resolve this issue and obtain a compact
indexing, a base b for the indexing that is compatible with the reﬁnement is often
chosen. With a 1-to-i reﬁnement, this usually means that the base of the indexing
method is taken to be i or
√
i (see Fig. 2.11). For instance, the reﬁnement associated
with the Hilbert and Morton curves is 1-to-4. Therefore, when using a Hilbert and
Morton curve, a base four or base two indexing is appropriate.
Indexing methods derived from SFCs have been widely used in DGGS and terrain
rendering. For instance, in (Bai et al. 2005; White 2000), Morton indexing was used
to index cells resulting from 1-to-4 reﬁnements on the icosahedron and octahedron,
while in (Bartholdi III and Goldsman 2001), the Sierpinski SFC was used to index
triangular cells reﬁned with a factor of two.
2.2.5.3
Axes-Based Indexing
Another mechanism for indexing is to use a coordinate system with m axes, U1 to
Um, that span the entire space on which the cells lie. Then the cells’ indices can be
expressed as m-dimensional vectors (i1, i2, . . . , im), in which the i j are integer values
that indicate the number of unit steps taken along each axis, U j. If, alternatively, a 1D

cube in (b) and coordinate systems for each face. d Indices of some cells after one step of 1-to-4
reﬁnement
index is required, these integer values can be appended together in a string, separated
using a delimiter character. A simple example of such an indexing can be used to
index a quadrilateral domain with Cartesian coordinates, as illustrated in Fig. 2.12a.
When a reﬁnement is applied to the cells, a subscript r is appended to the index
in order to encode the resolution. In the proposed axes-based indexing methods for
DGGSs, m is typically taken to be two or three. For instance, 3D indexing was used
in (Vince 2006) by taking the barycentric coordinate of each cell to be its index.
A 2D indexing method can be applied on the polyhedron used to construct a DGGS
by embedding the polyhedron’s faces into a 2D domain and deﬁning a coordinate
system over that domain (Mahdavi-Amiri and Samavati 2012). In this way, each face
can be given its own coordinate system (Mahdavi-Amiri et al. 2013, 2015a; Mahdavi-
Amiri and Samavati 2014). Figure 2.12 illustrates an indexing for the quadrilateral
cells of a cube after 1-to-4 reﬁnement, where each face has its own coordinate system.
In order to distinguish between the cells associated with each face, an additional
component that refers to the initial polyhedral face can be added to the indices. For
example, index (a, b) f
r refers to cell (a, b) in face f at resolution r (Fig. 2.12d).
2.2.5.4
Remarks on Categorization
Note that this categorization of index types is primarily intended to reﬂect the core
idea used to construct the indexing methods and can be used to easily identify which
operations can be handled naturally by a particular indexing system. For example,
hierarchy-based indexing methods naturally lead to efﬁcient hierarchical traversal
operations.However,well-designedindexingmethodsmustnecessarilyalsoconsider
other properties and support other operations. For example, it is certainly possible
to handle neighborhood ﬁnding in hierarchy-based indexing methods, although not
as efﬁciently or as naturally as with axes-based techniques. Based on the pattern of
indices, some indexing methods can be interpreted as belonging to two categories
(e.g. SFC or hierarchy-based). However, an indexing method is either constructed
through use of a parametrized curve or it inherits the index of its parent. It is possible
to use a parametrized SFC that indexes the children and preﬁxes the parent’s index.
2
Digital Earth Platforms
37
This indexing method is considered to be SFC-based, since the construction of the
indexing is based on the parametrization of the SFC and not on the hierarchy of the
cells.
2.3
Scientiﬁc Digital Earths
Now that we have discussed the various components that deﬁne different DGGSs,
let us examine some speciﬁc DGGS constructions that have been proposed in the
literature. Note that some proposed DGGSs are left for the following section, in
which we survey some of the existing Digital Earth implementations.
Among the earliest proposed DGGSs are those designed by Digital Earth pioneers
M.GoodchildandG.Dutton.Goodchild’sHSDS(HierarchicalSpatialDataStructure
(Goodchild and Shiren 1992)) is built upon an initial octahedron. Unlike many other
DGGSs, the faces of this octahedron are inverse projected to the sphere before the
generationofﬁnercells,andthereﬁnement(acongruent,1-to-4reﬁnement)isapplied
directly on the resulting spherical triangles (using geodesic rather than Euclidean
midpoints). The child cells are also spherical triangles, and are indexed using a
hierarchical base-4 numbering scheme (see Fig. 2.13). Unfortunately, the projection
implied by the reﬁnement method is neither equal-area nor conformal.
Dutton’s QTM (Quaternary Triangle Mesh (Dutton 1999)) is also constructed
using congruent 1-to-4 reﬁnement on an initial octahedron but utilizes the more
typical reﬁne-then-project approach (see Fig. 2.14). Here, the employed projection
is a specially designed projection that is also neither equal-area nor conformal—
the ZOT (Zenithal Orthotriangular Projection (Dutton 1991))—which tries to have
similar facets with vertices spaced uniformly in latitude and longitude, as well as
low areal distortion. Indexing is performed similarly to the HSDS, with the faces of
the initial octahedron indexed 1 through 8, and child cells indexed hierarchically in
base 4.
SCENZ-Grid (SEEGrid 2019) is a DGGS that is constructed based on an initial
cube polyhedron, and which was created through a collaboration between Landcare
Research and GNS Science primarily for the purpose of environmental monitoring.

indexing system of the QTM
The faces of the initial cube are reﬁned using a 1-to-9 congruent and aligned quadri-
lateral reﬁnement, and the resulting cells are inverse projected using the HEALPix
projection method (see Sect. 2.2.4.2). A hierarchical base-9 indexing system is used
to address the cells (see Fig. 2.15).
Quadrilateral cells are also found in Crusta (Bernardin et al. 2011), a DGGS
based on a rhombic triacontahedron. Each of the initial 30 quadrilateral faces under-
goes a 1-to-4 reﬁnement, and the generated vertices are normalized to the geoid.
Crusta’s primary motivation includes support for high-resolution topographical data
and images.
A number of hexagon-based DGGSs have also been proposed and have garnered
much research attention. The ISEA3H (Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area Aperture 3
Hexagonal)DGGSisaparticularlynotableexamplewhichstartsfromanicosahedron
(or truncated icosahedron) that undergoes an aligned 1-to-3 hexagonal reﬁnement
(US Patent No. 8400451, 2004; Sahr 2008). The resulting cells are inverse projected

39
Fig. 2.16 Two types of
1-to-4 hexagonal reﬁnement
can be combined, allowing a
triangular cell hierarchy to
be established and indexed
(and, indeed, any hexagonal reﬁnement scheme) is not congruent, special care must
be taken to deﬁne the cell hierarchy and indexing scheme. Several different indexing
schemes have been proposed for the ISEA3H DGGS. These include the hierarchical
indexing of PYXIS (US Patent No. 8400451, Peterson 2004), CPI (US Patent No.
9311350, Sahr 2016), coordinate-based indexing mechanisms (Sahr 2008; Mahdavi-
Amiri et al. 2015a; Vince 2006), or the algebraic encoding scheme of (Ben et al.
2018).
The icosahedron can also be reﬁned using 1-to-4 hexagonal reﬁnement, as in the
construction of the HQBS (Hexagonal Quaternary Balanced Structure (Tong et al.
2013)). The resulting cells are also inverse projected using Snyder’s projection. In
order to mitigate the incongruity of the hexagonal reﬁnement, two different 1-to-
4 reﬁnements are employed (aligned and unaligned; see Fig. 2.16). This allows a
triangular hierarchy to be deﬁned (aligned with the edges of the initial icosahedron)
and for lattice points to be indexed. By taking the index of the point at the cell’s
centroidtobethecell’sindex,abase4hierarchicalindexingsystemcanbeestablished
on the cells.
Other hexagon-based DGGSs include the OA3HDGG and OA4HDGG (Octahe-
dral Aperture 3/4 Hexagonal Discrete Global Grid (Vince 2006; Ben et al. 2010)). As
implied by the name(s), both DGGSs are constructed from an octahedron that under-
goes a hexagonal reﬁnement. The OA3HDGG utilizes a 1-to-3 hexagonal reﬁnement,
and its cells are indexed using a coordinate-based system. The vertices of the initial
octahedron are assigned the coordinates (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), and (0, 0, ±1); and the
cells are assigned indices based on their barycentric coordinates with respect to these
vertices. A similar indexing system is applied to the OA4HDGG, which utilizes a
1-to-4 hexagonal reﬁnement.
While most DGGSs discretize only the surface of the Earth, certain types of
geospatial data (e.g. earthquake data, airspace delineations, etc.) are volumetric in
nature and require a volumetric Earth representation. Hence, volumetric DGGSs such
as SDOG (Spheroid Degenerated-Octree Grid (Yu and Wu 2009; Yu et al. 2012))
have also been proposed. SDOG, which was designed to represent the global litho-
sphere, divides the Earth into an initial set of eight octants. Each octant is associated
with a degenerated octree, and undergoes a non-uniform reﬁnement that prevents cell
degeneracies at the Earth’s core (see Fig. 2.17). Cells are indexed using two different

chical Degenerated Z-Curve Filling) method indexes the cells of a single resolution
in base 10 (see Fig. 2.18), while MDZ (Multiple Hierarchical Degenerated Z-Curve
Filling) serves as a hierarchical indexing scheme in base 8 (see Fig. 2.19).

Public and Commercial Digital Earth Platforms
Naturally, a number of DGGSs and other Digital Earth concepts have been imple-
mented and made available for public use as either free or paid software.
2.4.1
Latitude/Longitude Grids
Due to their ease of use and long history, latitude/longitude grids remain a popular
choice for Digital Earth implementations despite the potential issues associated with
non-uniform DGGS cells. Chief among these implementations in terms of name
recognition is Google Earth (Google Inc. 2019a). Google Earth is created upon a
latitude/longitude grid using a simple cylindrical projection, with textures processed
via clip-mapping (Bar-Zeev 2007). Clip-Maps are a modiﬁed form of mip-map that
imposeamaximumimagesizeonthemip-maphierarchy(Tanneretal.1998),causing
the image hierarchy to more closely resemble an obelisk than the traditional pyramid
(see Fig. 2.20). The capped image size ensures that textures can ﬁt into memory and
be rendered in real-time.

T. Alderson et al.
Although not presented in 3D globe format, Google Maps and Bing Maps are
supported using methods that echo the fundamentals of a DGGS (See Figs. 2.21 and
2.22). In particular, Google Maps uses the Mercator projection on a latitude/longitude
grid that is reﬁned using a 1-to-4 reﬁnement. Each “tile” of the hierarchical grid
is associated with a 256 × 256-sized texture, and is indexed using an axis-based
coordinate system. Here, the top-left tile is indexed as (0, 0), with x values increasing
towards the east, and y values increasing towards the south (Google Inc. 2019b).

Bing Maps also uses the Mercator projection on a 1-to-4 reﬁned grid, but its
indexing system is hierarchical and based on quadtrees (Schwartz 2018). For an
illustration, see Fig. 2.21.
The OGC CDB (Common Database) API from Presagis (2019) is designed to
address one of the main issues with latitude/longitude DGGSs, namely the shrinking
of cells near the poles. The CDB divides the Earth into ﬁve zones depending on
proximity to the poles, with each zone utilizing a different spacing between lines of
longitude. While the CDB is available as an open commercial standard, a Pro license
can be purchased for additional features.
Unlike other DGGSs, C-squares (Concise Spatial Query and Representation Sys-
tem (Rees 2003)) discretizes only a single resolution of the Earth. Here, the lati-
tude/longitude grid is divided into four quadrants (NE, NW, SE, and SW), which are
then divided into ﬁner grids based on latitude and longitude (Fig. 2.23). The cells of
this discretization are indexed as iyxx, where i corresponds to the cell’s quadrant, y to
the cell’s latitude, and xx to the cell’s longitude. This system was created by CSIRO
Marine and Atmospheric Research, Australia for the purposes of mapping, spatial
search, and environmental assessment. Converters and source code can be found on
their website (CSIRO 2019).
Other Digital Earths based upon latitude/longitude grids include NASA’s open
source WorldWind API (NASA 2019); Skyline’s software products, TerraExplorer
client and SkylineGlobe server (Skyline Software Systems 2019); and two DGGS
libraries for web-based globe visualization—GlobWeb and CesiumJS (Telespazio
2019; Cesium Consortium 2019). GlobWeb is provided by Telespazio France under
the GNU LGPL v3 license, while CesiumJS was founded by the Cesium Consortium
and is open source.
CesiumJS in particular is a complete 3D mapping platform built using WebGL.
It is a cross-platform and cross-browser map engine that runs on a web browser
without plugins, and is now used in industries as diverse as archaeology, engineering,
construction, and sports visualizations. An accompanying tool, Cesium ion, provides
a point-and-click workﬂow to create 3D maps of users’ geospatial data that can be
visualized, analysed, and shared. It can be used to host datasets in 3D tiles, including
imagery, terrain, photogrammetry, point clouds, BIM, CAD, 3D buildings, and vector
44

data; and provides tools for analytics including measurements, volume and visibility
computations, and terrain proﬁles.
2.4.2
Geodesic DGGSs
Of course, not all DGGSs are based on singular 2D domains such as a lat-
itude/longitude grid; while comparatively rarer, different implementations of
Geodesic DGGSs do exist and are available for use. For instance, a library that imple-
ments the well-studied ISEA3H DGGS—known as geogrid—is offered on GitHub
(Mocnik 2019). This library is developed and maintained by Franz-Benjamin Moc-
nik, and is licensed under the MIT license.
A propriety implementation of the ISEA3H can be found at the core of the Digital
Earth system developed by Global Grid Systems (formerly the PYXIS innovation
(PYXIS innovation 2011; Global Grid Systems 2019)), and is one of the few com-
mercially available Geodesic DGGSs (Fig. 2.24). This system indexes the ISEA3H’s
hexagonal cells using the patented PYXIS indexing scheme (US Patent No. 8400451,
2004).
Other software platforms include implementations of the ECM (Ellipsoidal Cube
Map) and HEALPix (Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization of the sphere)
DGGSs. ECM (Lambers and Kolb 2012) is produced by applying 1-to-4 reﬁnement
on the quadrilateral faces of a cube that circumscribes the ellipsoidal Earth. Areal
and angle distortions are minimized by using a Quadrilateralized Spherical Cube
(QSC) projection. A Linux implementation is available on Martin Lambers’ website,
licensed under the GNU GPL v3 (Lambers 2019).

projection for polar regions. A software package from the Jet Propulsion Labora-
tory that supports spherical harmonics, pixel queries, data processing, and statistical
analysis can be found online (Jet Propulsion Laboratory 2019).
2.4.3
Installations: DESP
One of the largest scale Digital Earth undertakings can be found at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), where an interactive visualization environment called
the Digital Earth Science Platform was developed (Guo et al. 2017). Based on the
Digital Earth Prototype System Initiative that launched in 1999 (Guo et al. 2009,
2010),theDigitalEarthSciencePlatform(DESP)wasestablishedbytheCASin2010
in order to integrate state-of-the-art techniques and meet the increasing requirements
of geoscience applications.
The DESP is a technical platform that supports spatial data and information ser-
vices, as well as associated applications. It integrates 2D and 3D geographic infor-
mation systems, distributed storage and computing, virtual reality, wireless sensor
networks, and other technologies. A 600 m2 fully immersive, interactive visualiza-
tion environment was established at the CAS Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital
Earth (RADI) to support experiments with 3D visualization and to provide deci-
sion support for emergency response applications. This installation is equipped with
VR/AR devices, sensors, a 3D Stereo Projection System, and a high-performance
computing system, as shown in Fig. 2.26.
The DESP has already played an important role in the modeling of global change,
evaluation of natural disasters, and monitoring of natural resources and human settle-
ment through the integration of multi-sensor, multi-temporal remote sensing images,
in situ ground survey data, socio-economic data, and interdisciplinary scientiﬁc mod-
els (Fan et al. 2009). For example, the inﬂuence of sea level rise on the Earth’s major
46
T. Alderson et al.
Fig. 2.26 The DESP visualization environment at RADI
river deltas has been modeled and analyzed in a comparative study by using the
DESP. Emergency monitoring and response systems based upon the DESP have been
developed for disaster monitoring and post-disaster relief after earthquake events
(Fig. 2.27).
As a part of the ongoing Big Earth Data Science Engineering (CASEarth) initiative
(2018–2022), which is supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the
CAS, a new generation of the Digital Earth Science Platform will be developed to
provide a new impetus for interdisciplinary, cross-scale, macro-scientiﬁc discoveries
in the Era of Big Data to promote sustainability (Guo 2017).

Discrete Global Grid System Standards
The myriad ways in which one can construct a Digital Earth platform provide a great
deal of ﬂexibility that can help cater to a vast range of speciﬁc uses; however, this can
also create barriers to interoperability. This creates a real challenge as we move into
the Era of Big Data (and beyond), where interoperability and distributed analysis is
critical.
In the Era of Big Data, geoscience can only achieve its full potential through the
fusion of diverse Earth observation and socio-economic data together with informa-
tion from a vast range of sources. In this type of environment with multiple data
providers, fusion is only possible with an information system architecture based
upon open standards (Percivall 2013). Without a common and standardized means
of deﬁning and integrating various Digital Earth Platforms, our ability to transform
the increasingly massive amounts of data that are being acquired about the Earth into
actionable information is signiﬁcantly limited.
2.5.1
Standardization of Discrete Global Grid Systems
Recognizing the issues that non-standard global grid system implementations pose
and their potential impacts, in 2014, the Open Geospatial Consortium embarked on
the ambitious goal of standardizing DGGS. The goal of this endeavor was not to
identify the one DGGS that ought to be used by everyone, but to deﬁne the common
qualities of a variety of DGGSs that can be used to support interoperability while
providing some ﬂexibility in choice, thus allowing implementers to tailor DGGS
infrastructures to their speciﬁc uses. In July 2017, the OGC published the ﬁrst ever
international standard governing the design and implementation of DGGS (Purss
et al. 2017). This standard aims to promote awareness and reusability of DGGS
implementations, and integration between them, and, through this, to demonstrate
a path towards the realization of the “Digital Twin”—where our engagement and
understanding of the physical Earth can seamlessly interact with the Digital Earth,
and vice versa.
The core of the OGC DGGS standard is primarily based on an appropriate subset
of the well-accepted criteria for optimal DGGS design proposed by Goodchild (2000)
and Sahr et al. (2003).
2.5.2
Core Requirements of the OGC DGGS Abstract
Speciﬁcation
Along with the categorization provided earlier, under the OGC DGGS Abstract Spec-
iﬁcation, a compliant DGGS must deﬁne a hierarchical tessellation of equal area
48
T. Alderson et al.
cells that both partition the entire Earth at multiple levels of granularity and provide
a global spatial reference frame. In addition to these structural components, the sys-
tem must also include encoding methods to address each cell, assign quantized data
to cells, and perform algebraic operations on the cells and the data assigned to them.
The requirement of functional components for the infrastructure sets an OGC
DGGS apart from other grid frameworks or Coordinate Reference Systems. It also
provides a common operational basis for supporting communication and interoper-
ability between different compliant DGGS infrastructures.
2.5.2.1
Structural Requirements
The reference frame of a DGGS consists of the ﬁxed structural elements that deﬁne
the spatial framework on which the DGGS functional algorithms operate. These ﬁxed
structural elements include:
1. Domain completeness and position uniqueness: The DGGS must be deﬁned
over a global domain without any overlapping cells. Goodchild deﬁnes a global
domain to be achieved when the areal cells deﬁned by the grid “exhaustively
cover the globe without overlapping or underlapping” (Goodchild 2000);
2. Multiple levels of resolution: The DGGS must deﬁne multiple discrete global
grids forming a system of hierarchical tessellations, each with progressively ﬁner
spatial resolution and linked via a common cell reﬁnement method;
3. Preservation of domain completeness and position uniqueness: The DGGS
must preserve the total surface area (i.e. the global domain) throughout the entire
range of hierarchical tessellations. This facilitates the consistent representation
of information at all resolutions within the DGGS;
4. A simple geometric structure for each cell: In order for the DGGS to achieve
the requirement of a global domain, it is necessary for the shape of all cells deﬁned
by the DGGS to be simple polygons on the surface model of the Earth. The cell
shapes derived from the ﬁve (5) Platonic solids and thirteen (13) Archimedean
solids (triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, and octagon) are all simple
polygons that have the following properties:
a. The edges meet only at the vertices;
b. Exactly two edges meet at each vertex; and,
c. The polygons enclose a region which always has a measureable area.
5. Equal-area cells: The DGGS must be based on a hierarchy of equal-area tessel-
lations. Equal-area cells provide global grids with spatial units that (at multiple
resolutions) have an equal probability of contributing to an analysis. Equal-area
cells also help minimize the confounding effects of area variations in spatial
analyses, where the curved surface of the Earth is the fundamental reference
frame;
6. An initial polyhedral tessellation: To consistently achieve equal-area cells, the
DGGS must be constructed by mapping a polyhedron to the surface model of
2
Digital Earth Platforms
49
the Earth. This initial tessellation can then be reﬁned to produce equal-area child
cells for all subsequent levels in the hierarchy of tessellations;
7. Unique identiﬁers for each cell: In order to efﬁciently operate as a spatial
data integration engine, the cells of the DGGS must each be deﬁned by a glob-
ally unique identiﬁer. This ensures that the reference to each and every cell is
immutable. While the OGC DGGS Abstract Speciﬁcation requires each cell to
be uniquely identiﬁed, it does not prescribe or enforce how the implementer must
achieve this;
8. Each cell referenced at its centroid location: Each DGGS cell must be ref-
erenced at its centroid. This is because the centroid is the only location that
provides a systematic and consistent spatial reference point for all cells, regard-
less of shape.
2.5.2.2
Functional Requirements
The ability to locate and perform algebraic operations on data assigned to a DGGS
is critical for a DGGS to be able to support connectivity and hierarchical operations
on cells and to facilitate interoperability between DGGS implementations (as well
as other spatial data infrastructures or interfaces). Accordingly, the OGC DGGS
Abstract Speciﬁcation requires the DGGS to specify deﬁnitions for:
1. Quantization operations: Assigning data to and retrieving data from cells;
2. Algebraic operations: Performing algebraic operations on cells and the data
assigned to them, in addition to performing cell navigation; and
3. Interoperability operations: Translating cell addresses to other Coordinate Ref-
erence Systems (CRS), such as conventional latitude/longitude.
Again, the OGC DGGS Abstract Speciﬁcation enforces no speciﬁc implementa-
tions of these functional elements, but requires their inclusion (in some form) in any
compliant DGGS implementation. This both facilitates ﬂexibility and innovation in
the design of individual DGGS implementations and ensures the widest scope for
interoperability between compliant DGGS implementations. By focusing on end-
point functional requirements and not on the methods by which they are achieved,
the OGC DGGS Abstract Speciﬁcation supports interoperability across multiple
social and technical domains. This approach also allows for advancements in the
technologies that support these functional elements, without requiring the standard
to be constantly re-written.
2.5.3
The Future of the DGGS Standard
In support of the wider adoption and implementation of compliant (and interoperable)
DGGS implementations, there are a number of initiatives currently underway within
50
T. Alderson et al.
both the OGC and the International Standards Organization (ISO). These initiatives
include:
1. The publication of the OGC DGGS Abstract Speciﬁcation as an ISO standard
(ISO 19170). By publishing this standard as an ISO standard, it will be possible
to reach a wider community of potential DGGS implementers and thus increase
the adoption of DGGS technologies.
2. The establishment of an OGC Registry of compliant DGGS implementations.
This will facilitate the certiﬁcation and publication of compliant DGGS imple-
mentations and increase the awareness of the choices of available DGGS imple-
mentations that can be applied to a Spatial Data Infrastructure. This will be
similar in nature to the Coordinate Reference System Registry. The ﬁrst release
of the OGC DGGS Registry is anticipated to occur by the end of 2018.
3. The development of a standardized speciﬁcation of a common API language for
DGGS. This work is in its early phase but is expected to result in the drafting
and publication of a new OGC implementation standard that speciﬁes a com-
mon API language supporting and facilitating interoperability between different
DGGS implementations. A common API language for DGGS implementations
will further lower the technical barriers to the wider implementation of DGGS
technologies.
2.5.4
Linkages Between DGGS and Other Standards
Activities
As a technology, DGGSs have the potential to impact on almost all spatial technolo-
gies and their related standards. Consequently, a number of international standards
activities have included references to DGGSs and their potential applications to sev-
eral scenarios relevant to these initiatives. Two examples of this include:
1. The Joint OGC-W3C Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices (Van Den Brink
et al. 2019), where DGGS was proposed as an enabling component of QB4ST
(an extension of existing RDF Datacube vocabularies to support spatio-temporal
data).
2. The Global Statistical Geospatial Framework (GSGF), adopted during the 6th
Session of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Infor-
mation Management in August 2016, refers to DGGS and acknowledges that
these technologies have the potential to help realize the implementation of the
GSGF.
As the number of DGGS implementations increases, so too will the suite of
international standards that support them and their applications. The challenge for
the International Standards Community will be to keep the number and complexity
of these standards to an acceptable level in order to ensure that the DGGS standards
do not become a barrier to adoption in themselves.

Remote Sensing Satellites for Digital
Earth
Wenxue Fu, Jianwen Ma, Pei Chen and Fang Chen
Abstract The term remote sensing became common after 1962 and generally refers
to nonintrusive Earth observation using electromagnetic waves from a platform some
distance away from the object of the study. After more than ﬁve decades of devel-
opment, humankind can now use different types of optical and microwave sensors
to obtain large datasets with high precision and high resolution for the atmosphere,
ocean, and land. The frequency of data acquisition ranges from once per month to
once per minute, the spatial resolution ranges from kilometer to centimeter scales,
and the electromagnetic spectrum covers wavebands ranging from visible light to
microwave wavelengths. Technological progress in remote sensing sensors enables
us to obtain data on the global scale, remarkably expanding humanity’s understanding
of its own living environment from spatial and temporal perspectives, and provides
an increasing number of data resources for Digital Earth. This chapter introduces the
developments and trends in remote sensing satellites around the world.

Development of Remote Sensing
Remote sensing is a core technology for Earth observation. It covers information
collection, in-orbit processing, information storage and transmission, ground recep-
tion, processing for applications, calibration, veriﬁcation, applied research, and basic
research, providing fundamental data resources for Digital Earth (Guo 2012).

Overview of Remote Sensing
3.1.1.1
Remote Sensing Platforms
Remotesensingreferstovariousobservationandexplorationactivitiesoftheenviron-
ment involving humans and photoelectronic devices carried by satellites, spacecraft
(including space shuttles), aircraft, near-space vehicles, and various terrestrial plat-
forms. Artiﬁcial satellites that carry sensors to capture images of Earth’s surface are
referred to as remote sensing satellites. Satellites can successively observe the whole
globe or an assigned part of it within a deﬁned time period (Guo et al. 2016). Aircraft
often have a deﬁnite advantage because of their mobilization ﬂexibility. They can
be deployed wherever and whenever weather conditions are favorable. Satellites and
aircraft collect the majority of base map data and imagery used in remote sensing, and
the sensors typically deployed on these platforms include ﬁlm and digital cameras,
light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sys-
tems, and multispectral and hyperspectral scanners. Many of these instruments can
also be mounted on land-based platforms such as vans, trucks, tractors, and tanks. In
the future, the Moon will also be an ideal remote sensing platform (Guo et al. 2014a,
2018).
3.1.1.2
Remote Sensing Sensors
There are several types of Earth observation sensors: photographic sensors, scanning
imaging sensors, radar imaging sensors, and nonimaging sensors. Photographic sen-
sors work like a digital camera. Scanning imaging sensors capture two-dimensional
images by scanning point by point and line by line in a time sequence. These are
widely used today; such sensors can be further divided into surface scanning and
image scanning sensors. Imaging radar is an active sensor that emits electromag-
netic waves to form a lateral proﬁle. Currently, most Earth observation satellites
carry SAR systems that feature very high resolutions.
In the early stage of spaceborne Earth observation, traditional ﬁlm-based imaging
devices, return beam vidicon (RBV) TV cameras, and optical scanners were the
main devices used for Earth observation. Images obtained from these devices were
mainly color and black-and-white representations of Earth’s surface and cloud layer,
covering the visible light and near infrared ranges. After the ﬁrst land observation
satellite, Landsat 1, was launched in 1972, the new multispectral scanner (MSS) it
carried sent data that was processed in the form of a digital time sequence array. This
marked a progressive step in the development of digital image processing.
Compared with optical remote sensors, SARs work in various weather conditions
and can penetrate some surface objects. In contrast to passive sensor systems that
only receive reﬂected solar light or infrared radiation, radar systems act as active
sensors and emit electromagnetic waves on their own. A radar sensor sends pulses
of energy to the Earth’s surface and part of that energy is reﬂected and forms return

signals. The strength of the return signal depends on the roughness and dampness of
the Earth’s surface and the inclination of surface objects toward the waves sent by
radar.
3.1.2
Development of Remote Sensing Satellites
Based on a life cycle of approximately thirteen years, Earth observation satellites
have gone through four generations (Fig. 3.1) (Zhou 2010).
(1) The ﬁrst generation, beginning spaceborne Earth observation: 1960–1972
CORONA, ARGON, and LANYARD were the ﬁrst three imaging satellite observa-
tion systems. Data obtained from these satellites were used for detailed terrestrial
reconnaissance and regional mapping. In the early years, satellite images were made
by combining hundreds or even thousands of photos, most of which were black-and-
white, with a small number of color photos or three-dimensional image pairs. These
images covered most parts of Earth. For example, images obtained using the KH-5
camera covered most of the Earth’s surface with a 140-m pixel resolution. However,
these images did not form systematic observations like those achieved later with
Landsat data.
(2) The second generation, experimental and tentative application: 1972–1986
Landsat-1 was launched on July 23, 1972, marking the start of modern satellite-
carried Earth observation. It provided a novel high-resolution Earth image database to
international science organizations, making further exploration of Earth’s resources
possible. Landsat-1 carried an MSS that received four bands with wavelengths from
0.5 to 1.1 µm with a spatial resolution of 80 m, frame width of 185 km, and revisit
cycle of eighteen days. Notably, Landsat-1 transmitted data in digital form for the ﬁrst
time. The foundation for multispectral processing was laid in the 1970s and organiza-
tions involved in this ﬁeld included NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), United
States Geological Survey (USGS), Environmental Research Institute of Michigan
(ERIM), and Laboratory for Applications of Remote Sensing (LARS). Ten years

later, Landsat accommodated four more MSS wavebands as Landsat TM emerged
during 1982–1984 with a spatial resolution of 30 m covering seven spectral bands.
Soon afterwards, the famous SPOT HRV system was launched in 1986 with a spa-
tial resolution of 10 m for the panchromatic wavebands and 30 m for three other
multispectral bands.
(3) The third generation, wide application: 1986–1997
After 1986, the technology and applications of satellite Earth observation developed
rapidly. SPOT-1, launched on February 22, 1986, carried a high-resolution visual
sensor and was the ﬁrst use of pushbroom linear array sensors. It was also the ﬁrst
satellite system capable of cross-track three-dimensional observation. Later, the ESA
launched the ERS-1 SAR on July 17, 1991. ERS-1 was an active microwave satellite
that provided images with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Japan launched its JERS-1
in February 1992 with an L-band SAR, building up the overall observation capacity
of SARs. Data provided by these active microwave sensors played an important
role in enhancing the observation and understanding of environmental and climatic
phenomena, and supported the categorization of sea ice and research on the coastal
zone.
(4) The fourth generation, high-resolution and hyperspectral imaging: 1997–2010
This comprises the latest generation of Earth observation satellites equipped with
the most advanced technologies that are still gradually maturing. The main features
are a spatial resolution of 1 m or less, coverage of 200 wavebands ranging from
0.4 to 2.5 µm in wavelength, a spectral resolution of 10 nm, revisit cycles less than
three days, capability of multiangle and three-dimensional observation, and precise
spatial positioning with GPS. The major advantage of high-resolution imaging is that
it allows for identiﬁcation of buildings, roads, and modern construction projects as
well as change detection. As a result, high-resolution imagery products are mainly
used in GIS and special-purpose mapping.
At this stage, attention was primarily focused on spatial and temporal resolu-
tions, spectral coverage, orbital height, revisit capability, mapping bandwidth, image
dimensions, capacity for three-dimensional observation, imaging models, data stor-
age, and the market demand for satellites.
(5) The ﬁfth generation, a new era of satellite Earth observation
Next-generation Earth observation satellites are expected to be highly intelligent
and integrate Earth observation sensors, data processing devices, and communica-
tion systems. Global surveying and real-time environmental analysis of Earth will
become possible. More experts as well as casual users will be involved in remote
sensing, photogrammetry and GIS, and data inversion products will also be updated
more frequently. To achieve real-time data acquisition, improve applications and
spare casual users the trouble of understanding complicated data processing, image
providers will offer mature imaging products that directly meet various demands
(Guo et al. 2014b).

Land Observation Satellites
Land observation satellites have been developed for land resource investigation, ter-
restrial environment research, crop condition forecasting, and natural disaster mon-
itoring. Terrestrial variables have a speciﬁc “ground object spectrum” and radia-
tion scattering; terrestrial variables can be retrieved by considering the direction,
scale, and sensitivity to establish the relationship between electromagnetic waves
and ground surface variables for space observation.
3.2.1
US Land Observation Satellites
The United States launched its ﬁrst land satellite, Landsat 1, on July 23, 1972. For the
ﬁrst time in human history, satellites were consistently providing Earth images with
a certain resolution, making it possible to use satellites to survey Earth’s resources.
Since then, the country has launched seven satellites in the Landsat series (the launch
of Landsat 6 failed). They are currently the world’s most widely used land observation
satellites (Table 3.1).
Later, the United States launched a series of high-resolution commercial remote
sensing satellites. The IKONOS satellite, launched on September 24, 1999, was
the world’s ﬁrst commercial remote sensing satellite providing high-resolution
images. After that, the country launched the QuickBird, WorldView-1, GeoEye-1,
and Wor1dView-2 satellites in October 2001, September 2007, September 2008, and
October 2009, respectively, with improved resolutions from 0.61 to 0.41 m (multi-
spectral) (Aguilar et al. 2013).

Landsat Program
TheEarthResourcesSatellitePrograminvolvesaseriesofEarthobservationsatellites
jointly managed by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These
satellites collect information about Earth from space. They have been providing
digital photos of Earth’s continents and coastal regions for more than 40 years,
enabling researchers to study Earth from various aspects and evaluate the impacts of
natural and human activities on the dynamics of the Earth system.
(1) Landsat 7
Landsat 7 moves around Earth on a near-polar sun-synchronous orbit, with an orbital
altitude of 705.3 km and an operation cycle of 98.9 min, covering Earth once every
sixteen days. During the day, it operates on a descending orbit, crossing the equator
at 10:00 AM. The orbit is adjusted so that orbital inclination is kept within a certain
limit and the deviation of the satellite transit time from the nominal time is kept
within ±5 min.

The ETM+ of Landsat 7 was developed based on the TM of Landsats 4 and 5 and
the ETM of Landsat 6. It is a multispectral vertical-orbit scanning radiometer that
performs Earth imaging directly facing the nadir and obtains high-resolution ground
images. Its scanning width is 185 km. Similar to the previous Landsats, the EMT+
uses a scan line corrector to eliminate the interline overlap or interline spacing caused
by the scanning operation or orbital motion.
In the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range, ETM+ has four color bands and
one panchromatic band. Each of the six sounder arrays in the visible, near-infrared
and SWIR bands has sixteen sounders staggered along the orbital direction, and each
sounder corresponds to a ground area of 30 × 30 m. The LWIR sounder array has
eight sounders, each corresponding to a ground area of 60 × 60 m, with a resolution
twice as high as that of the previous thermal infrared TM. The panchromatic band
was a new addition to Landsat 7. The sounder array consists of 32 sounders, each
corresponding to a ground area of 15 × 15 m. The bands of ETM+ are described in
Table 3.2.
(2) Landsat 8 (LDCM)
Landsat 8, also referred to as LDCM, carries two main payloads: one operational land
imager (OLI) and one thermal infrared sensor (TIRS). Compared with the payloads
of previous Landsats, the performance of the OLI and TIRS are much improved.
Landsat 8 can capture at least 400 images per day (its predecessors could only
capture 250). This is because Landsat 8 is more ﬂexible in monitoring an area (Ali
et al. 2017). Previous Landsats could only monitor a certain swath of land directly
under their ﬂight path, but the remote sensor of Landsat 8 can capture information
about land that deviates from the ﬂight path by a certain angle, which the previous
Landsats could do only in subsequent laps. This advantage helps capture imagery
needed for multitemporal comparison (such as images concerning disasters).
The main parameters of Landsat 8 are: a Worldwide Reference System-2 (WRS-2)
ﬂight path/line system, a sun-synchronous orbital altitude of 705 km, global coverage
cycle of sixteen days (except for high-latitude polar regions), 233 orbits per cycle,
an orbital inclination of 98.2° (slightly to the right), an operation cycle of 98.9 min,
and a 170 × 185 km imaging area. The satellite crosses the equator at 10:00 AM ±
62
W. Fu et al.
15 min. Its image directory is prepared in the same way as those of Landsats 4, 5
and 7, and it supports the ability to capture the main image and images that deviate
from the nadir point to a limited extent (±1 ﬂight path/line).
3.2.1.2
GRACE Satellite Program
The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite program aims to
obtain the features of medium and long waves of Earth’s gravity ﬁeld and the time-
varying characteristics of the global gravity ﬁeld (Melzer and Subrahmanyam 2017)
and to sound the atmospheric and ionospheric environment. The GRACE satellite
was launched on March 17, 2002 from the Plesetsk Launch Center in northern Russia.
Its working principle is shown in Fig. 3.2.
The satellite adopts a low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking mode with two simul-
taneously launched low Earth orbit satellites that travel on the same orbit with a
distance of 220 km in between them. Satellite-borne GPS receivers can accurately
determine the orbital position of the two satellites and measure their distance and
the changes in distance accurate to the micron level. A triaxial accelerometer is used
to measure nonconservative forces. The observation data of each satellite, including
the data of gravity-related measurements and GPS occultation measurements, are
transmitted to the ground station via S-band radio waves.
The scientiﬁc objectives of the GRACE satellite project are (1) to determine
Earth’s mediumwave and longwave gravity ﬁeld with a geoid precision of 0.01 cm
and 0.01 mm for 5,000 km and 500 km wavelengths, respectively, which is two
orders of magnitude higher than that of the CHAMP satellite (Ditmar 2004); (2) to

determine changes in the global gravity ﬁeld based on observation data from 2 to
4 weeks or longer, with an expected geoid determination precision of 0.001 mm/y;
and (3) to sound the atmospheric and ionospheric environment. As the GRACE satel-
lites provide highly accurate information about Earth’s mediumwave and longwave
gravity ﬁeld and its time-dependent changes, they mark the beginning of a new era
of satellite-based gravity research (Liu 2009).
3.2.1.3
Commercial Remote Sensing Satellites
On September 24, 1999, the IKONOS satellite was successfully launched at Van-
denberg Air Force Base, marking the start of the era of high-resolution commercial
satellites. On March 31, 2015, IKONOS was retired after 15 years of over service, a
working lifetime more than twice of that in the design. IKONOS was a commercial
satellite that acquired 1-m resolution panchromatic images and 4-m resolution mul-
tispectral images. Additionally, the resolution of the integrated color image with the
panchromatic and multispectral images was up to 1 m. The IKONOS revisit period
was 1–3 days imaging from the 681 km orbit.
The QuickBird satellite was launched in October 2001 with a panchromatic spa-
tial resolution of 0.61 m and multispectral resolution of 2.44 m. The WorldView-1
satellite, launched on September 18, 2007, was the commercial imaging satellite
with the highest resolution and the fastest response speed in the world at that time.
WorldView-1 has an average revisit period of 1.7 days in a sun-synchronous orbit at
an altitude of 496 km and inclination angle of 98°. The large-capacity panchromatic
system can capture images up to 550,000 km2 with 0.5-m resolution every day. The
satellite also has high geolocation accuracy and quick response, which provides quick
aiming at the target to effectively perform on-track stereo imaging. Its acquisition
capacity is four times that of the QuickBird satellite. Parameters of the WorldView-1
satellite are shown in Table 3.3.
WorldView-2, launched in October 2009, was the ﬁrst commercial remote sens-
ing satellite in the world to provide 8-band high resolution data, greatly enhancing
the customer service ability of DigitalGlobe. In June 2014, with the consent of the
US Department of Defense and the State Department, the US Department of Com-
merce formally approved DigitalGlobe’s application for the sale of 0.25-m resolution
satellite image data.
With the implementation of the new policy, WorldView-3, the third-generation
remote sensing satellite, was successfully launched in August 2014 and is the world’s
ﬁrst commercial multipayload, hyperspectral and high resolution satellite, providing
0.31-m panchromatic imagery and 1.24-m multispectral imagery. The WorldView-4
commercial remote sensing satellite was launched in November 2016 and has greatly
improved the overall data acquisition capability of the DigitalGlobe constellation
group. It can image any point on the Earth 4.5 times a day, with a ground sampling
distance (GSD) of less than 1 m.

Satellite Images for Google Earth
Google Earth’s images come from multisource data composed of satellite images
and aerial data. Its satellite images mainly come from the QuickBird commercial
satellite, GeoEye satellite and IKONOS satellite of the DigitalGlobe Company of
the United States, as well as the SPOT-5 satellite of France.
The GeoEye series of satellites are the next generation of the IKONOS and Orb-
View satellites. The GeoEye-1 satellite, launched on September 6, 2008 from Van-
denberg Air Force Base in California can acquire black-and-white (panchromatic)
imagery with 0.41-m resolution and color (multispectral) imagery with 1.65-m res-
olution, and can accurately locate the target position with 3 m accuracy. Therefore,
it has become the most powerful commercial imaging satellite with the highest reso-
lution and accuracy in the world. The GeoEye-1 satellite runs in a solar synchronous
orbit with an altitude of 681 km and inclination angle of 98°, an orbit period of 98 min
and a revisit period of less than 3 days. The satellite’s launch mass was 1955 kg, and
the design life is 7 years. The payload of the GeoEye-1 satellite is a pushbroom imag-
ing camera consisting of an optical subsystem (telescope module, aperture 1.1 m),
a focal plane module and a digital electronic circuit. The main parameters of the
GeoEye-1 satellite are shown in Table 3.4.

On April 8, 2010, the ESA launched CryoSat-2 using a Dnepr rocket. As one of
the primary missions of the European Earth Observation Program (EOP), CryoSat
uses a radar altimeter to measure the thickness of Earth’s land ice and sea ice sheets,
especially polar ice and oceanic ﬂoating ice, to study the effects of global warming.
Earlier, in October 2005, the launch of CryoSat-1 was unsuccessful due to a rocket
failure.
SIRAL is the main payload of CryoSat-2, weighing 62 kg (Dibarboure et al. 2011).
It is mainly used to observe the internal structure of ice shields and study sea ice and
landforms. SIRAL has three measurement modes: the low-resolution measurement
(LRM) mode, which is only used to measure relatively ﬂat polar and oceanic ice
sheets; the SAR mode that is used to measure sea ice with an along-track resolution
of 250 m; and the InSAR mode that is used to study ice sheets in more complex
and steep areas with a measurement accuracy of 1 to 3 cm (Wingham et al. 2006).
In contrast to traditional radar altimeters, the delay Doppler radar altimeter (DDA)
adopted by SIRAL can emit continuous pulse trains and can make efﬁcient use of
Earth’s surface reﬂection power via full Doppler bandwidth. SIRAL was designed
based on existing instruments but has improved performance compared with the radar
altimeters on board ERS-1, ERS-2 and ENVISAT. SIRAL has two pairs of Cassegrain
antennas that are used to transmit radar signals and receive signals reﬂected from the
ground to obtain accurate information about polar and sea ice thickness. SIRAL can
accurately measure irregular and steep edges of land ice, and can obtain data from
sea and river ice. The characteristics of SIRAL are shown in Table 3.5.

(2) Copernicus Program
The Copernicus program, formerly Global Monitoring for Environment and Security
(GMES), was a major space development program launched by the European Union
in 2003. Its main purpose is to ensure Europe’s sustainable development, enhance
international competitiveness, security and to realize real-time dynamic monitoring
of the environment by coordinating, managing and integrating the observation data
of existing and future European and non-European (third-party) satellites.
In terms of EOS infrastructure development, the GMES program is divided into
three parts. The ﬁrst part is the space-based observation for which ESA is responsible.
New satellites will be launched and the existing satellites are divided into six mission
groups (see Table 3.6). The second part is the ground-based observation for which the
European Environment Agency (EEA) is responsible. The third part is data sharing,
which calls for building capacity for comprehensive and sustainable observation data
applications and the construction of network entrances for data access; data services
are mainly provided by the ESA, French Space Agency (CNES), and EUMETSAT.
3.2.2.2
France’s Satellites
On February 22, 1986, France launched its ﬁrst Earth resources observation satellite,
SPOT-1. Thus far, seven SPOT satellites have been sent into space. The sounders
adopted by these satellites have unique characteristics and the imaging method is also
unique. Additionally, SPOT satellites are the world’s ﬁrst remote sensing satellites

Table 3.7.
The CNES launched the SPOT-5 remote sensing satellite in May 2002, with
a design life of ﬁve years and total mass of 3,030 kg. Compared with the ﬁrst four
SPOT satellites, SPOT-5 has signiﬁcantly improved observation capability and incor-
porated new instruments (Table 3.8), including the following: (1) An HSR with a
panchromatic spectral resolution of 10 m, (2) two HRGs with working bands that
differ from HRV and HRVIR, and (3) a VEGETATION-2 imager that could achieve
global coverage almost every day with an imaging resolution of 1 km.
SPOT-6 was launched by India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on ﬂight C21 on
September 9, 2012 and SPOT-7 was launched on PSLV ﬂight C23 on June 30, 2014.
They form a constellation of Earth-imaging satellites designed to provide continuity
of high-resolution, wide-swath data up to 2024. EADS Astrium took the decision
to build this constellation in 2009 based on a perceived government need for this
kind of data. SPOT-6 and SPOT-7 are phased in the same orbit as Pléiades 1A and
Pléiades 1B, which are at an altitude of 694 km, forming a constellation of 2-by-2
satellites that are 90° apart from one another.

Germany’s Satellites
CHAMP is a small satellite mission for geoscience research, atmospheric studies,
and applications headed by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ)
(GFZ 2018; Guo et al. 2008). As a near-polar, low Earth orbit satellite equipped
with high-precision, multifunction, completely satellite-borne instruments (magne-
tometer, accelerometer, STAR sensor, GPS receiver, laser mirror, ion drift meter).
CHAMP had a design life of ﬁve years, and ended on September 19, 2010. Its shape
and onboard instruments are shown in Fig. 3.3. It could simultaneously measure
Earth’s gravitational and magnetic ﬁelds with high precision and detect their tempo-
ral and spatial changes (Baduraet al. 2006).
The CHAMP mission had three main goals: (1) to accurately determine the long-
wavelength characteristics of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld and its temporal changes;
(2) to estimate, with unprecedented accuracy, temporal and spatial variations of the
magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth’s main body and crust, and all components of the magnetic
ﬁeld; and (3) to study temperature, water vapor, and electrons using a large amount
of globally distributed GPS signal refraction data generated by the atmosphere and
ionosphere.
TerraSAR-X is a German SAR satellite mission for scientiﬁc and commercial
applications that was launched on June 15, 2007. The project is managed by the
DLR (German Aerospace Center). In 2002, EADS Astrium GmbH was awarded a
contract to implement the X-band TerraSAR satellite (TerraSAR-X) on the basis of
a public-private partnership agreement (PPP). In this arrangement, EADS Astrium
funded part of the implementation cost of the TerraSAR-X system.
The science objectives are to make multimode and high-resolution X-band data
available for a wide spectrum of scientiﬁc applications in ﬁelds such as hydrology,
geology, climatology, oceanography, environmental and disaster monitoring, and
cartography (DEM generation) using interferometry and stereometry.

China’s Land Observation Satellites
3.2.3.1
Resource Satellites
Resource satellites are used to survey the Earth’s natural resources and carry out
scientiﬁc research on the Earth system. China has developed a series of satellites for
land observation.
(1) CBERS satellites
The China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellites (CBERS) were jointly developed by
China and Brazil using their combined investment in accordance with an agreement
signed by both countries in 1988. CBERS was shared by the two countries after being
put into operation. The ﬁrst CBERS (CBERS-1) was successfully launched in 1999
as China’s ﬁrst-generation transmission-type Earth resource satellite. CBERS-02
was the successor to CBERS-01 and had the same function, composition, platform,
payload, and nominal performance parameters as its predecessor. CBERS-02 was
launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center on October 21, 2003.
The payload and orbital parameters of CBERS-01/2 are listed in Table 3.9 (China
Center for Resource Satellite Data and Applications 2012; China Academy of Space
Technology 2004). The CBERS-1/02 payload included three kinds of sensors: a
charge-coupled device (CCD), an infrared multispectral scanner (IRMSS), and a

(2) CBERS-02B
CBERS-02B was an Earth observation satellite jointly developed by China and
Brazil. The satellite was sent into orbit on September 19, 2007 from the Taiyuan
Satellite Launch Center, and the ﬁrst batch of Earth observation images was received
on September 22, 2007. The satellite is no longer in operation. Its technical param-
eters are shown in Table 3.10.
CBERS-02B was equipped with three spatial resolutions: high, medium, and
low. A combination of the CCD and HR images sent back from the satellite helped
accurately identify and interpret residential areas, roads, forests, mountains, rivers,
and other ground features. It could monitor the expansion of urban areas and provide
a basis for urban planning and construction. Furthermore, it could provide support
for decision making for precision agriculture. CBERS-02B could also be used to
produce detailed maps such as dynamic land use maps and to update large-scale
topographic maps.
(3) ZY-1 02C
The ZY-1 02C resource satellite was launched on December 22, 2011. It weighs
approximately 2,100 kg and had a design life of three years. ZY-1 02C carries a
panchromatic multispectral camera and a high-resolution panchromatic camera.
Thesatellitehastwonotablefeatures.First,its10-mresolutionP/MSmultispectral
camera boasts the highest resolution of the multispectral cameras installed on China’s
civilian remote sensing satellites. Second, the two 2.36-m resolution HR cameras it
carries make the monitoring swath as wide as 54 km, which greatly increased the
data coverage and signiﬁcantly shortened the satellite’s repetition period. ZY-1 02C’s

TheZY-3resourcesatellitewaslaunchedonJanuary6,2012.Itweighsapproximately
2,650 kg and had a design life of ﬁve years. The satellite’s mission is to continuously,
reliably, and rapidly capture high-resolution stereo images and multispectral images
of all parts of the country for a long period of time.
ZY-3 is China’s ﬁrst high-resolution civilian optical transmission-type stereo map-
ping satellite that integrates surveying, mapping, and resource investigation func-
tions. The onboard front-view, rear-view, and vertical-view cameras can capture
stereoscopic pairs in the same region from three different viewing angles to pro-
vide a wealth of three-dimensional geometric information. The image control and
positioning precision are greater than one pixel. The swath of the front-view and rear-
view stereoscopic pairs is 52 km wide and the baseline-height ratio is 0.85–0.95. The
vertical image is 2.1 m, meeting the demand for 1:25,000 topographic map updates.
ZY-3’s payload parameters are shown in Table 3.12 (China Center for Resource
Satellite Data and Applications 2012; China Academy of Space Technology 2004).
In 2012, ZY-3 sent back 1,590 batches of raw data, totaling 250 TB. The valid
data covered 7.5 million square kilometers in China and 30 million square kilometers
across the world. Imagery of Dalian, China, captured by the ZY-3 satellite is shown
in Fig. 3.4.

Environment and Disaster Reduction Satellites
The environment and disaster reduction satellites are collectively referred to as the
“China Small Satellite Constellation for Environment and Disaster Monitoring and
Forecasting” (“Small Satellite Constellation” for short). The constellation is capable
of using visible, infrared, microwave remote sensing and other means of observation

Fig. 3.5 The HJ-1A (left) and HJ-1B (right) satellites
to meet the needs of all-weather, 24-h observation and forecasting of natural disasters
and environmental events.
(1) HJ-1A/B
The HJ-1A and HJ-1B environment and disaster reduction satellites were launched at
11:25 on September 6, 2008. HJ-1A carries a CCD camera and hyperspectral imager
(HSI) and HJ-1B is equipped with a CCD camera and infrared scanner (IRS). HJ-
1A and HJ-1B are equipped with the same type of CCD camera. The two cameras
were placed symmetrically across the nadir, equally dividing the ﬁeld of view. The
cameras make parallel observations to achieve pushbroom imaging in four spectral
bands with a 700-km Earth observation swath and a ground pixel resolution of 30 m.
Additionally, the HSI on HJ-1A realizes pushbroom imaging in 110–128 spectral
bands with a 50-km Earth observation swath and a ground pixel resolution of 100 m.
HSI has a side view ability of ±30° and an onboard calibration function. The IRS on
board HJ-1B completes imaging in four spectral bands (near, short, medium and long)
with a 720-km Earth observation swath and a ground pixel resolution of 150/300 m.
The two satellites are shown in Fig. 3.5.
(2) HJ-1C
HJ-1C is China’s ﬁrst S-band small SAR and environment and disaster reduction
satellite, launched on November 9, 2012. HJ-1C has a mass of 890 kg and a sun-
synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 km. The local time of the orbital descending
node is 18:00. Together with HJ-1A and HJ-1B, HJ-1C constitutes the ﬁrst stage of
China’s environment and disaster reduction satellite constellation.
HJ-1C is equipped with an S-band SAR. Its payload works in two modes (strip
mode and scanning mode) and employs a 6 × 2.8 m foldable mesh parabolic antenna.
The SAR antenna was unfolded once HJ-1C entered orbit. It went into a swath
imaging work mode after preparation. The onboard SAR has two imaging swaths:
40 and 100 km. The SAR’s single-view spatial resolution is 5 m and the four-view
spatial resolution is 20 m. Most of the HJ-1C’s SAR images are taken in a multiview
mode. The HJ-1C satellite is shown in Fig. 3.6.
The payload parameters of HJ-1C are shown in Table 3.13 (Satellite Environment
Center, Ministry of Environmental Protection 2010a).

Satellites of the High-Resolution Earth Observation Program
Globally, the United States was the ﬁrst country to develop high-resolution Earth
observation systems. Other countries such as Israel, France, and India have only
one or two of these satellites each. Currently, China has no high-resolution satel-
lites. According to the China Geographic Surveying and Mapping Information and
Innovation Report (2012), although China has achieved success in satellite remote
sensing technology, it is still behind in high-resolution civilian remote sensing satel-
lite technology and its commercial applications.
GF-1 (Gaofen-1) was the ﬁrst satellite of China High-resolution Earth Observation
System (CHEOS) and was launched using an LM-2D rocket from the Jiuquan Satel-
lite Launch Center on April 26, 2013. GF-1’s development helped China master key
technologies such as high spatial resolution, multispectral sensors, optical sensors,
wide coverage, multipayload image mosaic fusion, precise and stable altitude con-
trol, and high-resolution data processing. Additionally, the development of GF-1
helped improve the capability for independent development of high-resolution satel-
lites, and enhanced the self-sufﬁciency of high-resolution remote sensing data. The
design life of GF-1 is ﬁve to eight years (Ding 2013).
76
W. Fu et al.
Fig. 3.7 GF-2 image (resolution: 0.8 m)
On April 28, 2013, GF-1 began imaging and sending data. Data were received by
the RADI Miyun Ground Station and processed by the China Center for Resource
Satellite Data and Application. The ﬁrst batch of images included four types: 2 m
panchromatic, 8 m multispectral, 16 m multispectral, and 2 m panchromatic fused
with 8 m multispectral.
GF-2 was launched successfully from Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center using an
LM-4B carrier rocket on August 19, 2014. The successful launch was a result of
special high-deﬁnition projects, indicating that Chinese remote sensing satellites
were entering a submeter “high-deﬁnition era”. GF-2’s spatial resolution was 1.0 m
and the swath width was 45 km, which was the largest imaging width of similar
satellites of other countries (Fig. 3.7). GF-2 will be used for geographic and resource
surveillance, environmental and climate change monitoring, precision agriculture,
disaster relief, and city planning. The satellite is equipped with two cameras with the
same resolution. The GF-2 camera can “twist its neck” to observe a range of ±35° in
180 s. GF-2 can swivel on its axis 35° to either side. Additionally, GF-2’s ﬁve-year
lifetime is longer than that of most other Chinese satellites, but the desired goal is
eight years.
The GF-3 satellite is a new high-resolution SAR imaging satellite launched by
an LM-4C rocket at 06:55 on August 10, 2016. It blasted off at the Taiyuan Satel-
lite Launch Center in Taiyuan, the capital of northern China’s Shanxi Province. As
China’s ﬁrst C-band SAR imaging satellite that is accurate to one meter, it covers
the globe with an all-weather, 24-h observation service and will be used for disas-
ter warning, weather forecasting, water resource assessments, and the protection of
maritime rights. With 12 imaging modes, the high-deﬁnition observation satellite
can take wide pictures of the Earth and photograph detailed scenarios of speciﬁc
areas. GF-3 is also China’s ﬁrst low orbit remote sensing satellite that has a lifespan

of eight years. It provides high-deﬁnition remote sensing data for its users over long
periods of time. GF-3 is a polar orbit satellite with a high spatial resolution (Fig. 3.8)
that can play a role in observing slowly changing objects such as water bodies, ice,
and snow.
On June 26, 2015, China successfully launched the high-deﬁnition Earth obser-
vation satellite GF-8 into orbit from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center. GF-8 is
an optical remote sensing satellite used in land surveying, urban planning, land
delineation, highway and railway network design, crop yield estimation, disaster
prevention and reduction, and other ﬁelds. The GF-9 satellite was launched from the
Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center using an LM-2D carrier rocket on September 14,
2015. GF-9 is also an optical remote sensing satellite under CHEOS. The satellite
can provide pictures with a ground pixel resolution of less than 1 m. It will be used
in land surveying, urban planning, road network design, agriculture, and disaster
prevention and relief.
On December 29, 2015, GF-4 was launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch
Center in the southwestern province of Sichuan on board an LM-3B carrier rocket. It
was the 222nd ﬂight of the Long March rocket series. In contrast to GF-1 and GF-2,
which orbit at low elevations (600–700 km) around Earth, GF-4 orbits 36,000 km
away and moves synchronously with Earth. It can spot an oil tanker at sea using the
CMOS camera, and features the best imaging capability among global high-orbit
remote sensing satellites. GF-4 is China’s ﬁrst geosynchronous orbit HD optical

The GF-5 and GF-6 satellites were launched on May 9 and June 2, 2018, respec-
tively. GF-5 was designed to run on a sun-synchronous orbit and carries six payloads:
an advanced hyperspectral imager (AHSI), a visual and infrared multispectral imager
(VIMI), an atmospheric infrared ultraspectral sounder (AIUS), a greenhouse gases
monitoring instrument (GMI), an environmental trace gases monitoring instrument
(EMI), and a directional polarization camera (DPC). The GF-6 satellite has a similar
function to the GF-1 satellite but has better cameras, and its high-resolution images
can cover a large area of the Earth, according to the State Administration of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defence. GF-6 can observe the nutritional
content of crops and help estimate the yields of crops such as corn, rice, soybeans,
cotton and peanuts. Its data will also be applied in monitoring agricultural disasters
such as droughts and ﬂoods, evaluation of agricultural projects and surveying of
forests and wetlands.
Parameters of the GF satellites are shown in Table 3.14.

Remote Sensing Microsatellites
Microsatellites are a new type of satellite that is low-cost and has a short development
time and more ﬂexible operation than conventional spacecraft that are heavy, costly,
and time-consuming to develop. The spatial and temporal resolutions of Earth obser-
vation can be signiﬁcantly improved using a distributed constellation of microsatel-
lites. As a result, microsatellites are becoming more widely used around the world.
China has launched several series of microsatellites for Earth observation, such as
the “SJ” series, “Tsinghua-1”, “NS-2”, and “Beijing-1”, which have improved and
enriched the Chinese satellite observation system.
3
Remote Sensing Satellites for Digital Earth

SJ-9A and SJ-9B are a new generation of microsatellite launched in 2012. They
are the ﬁrst satellites in the “New-tech Civilian Experimental Satellite” series. SJ-
9A is equipped with a high-resolution multispectral camera with a panchromatic
resolution of 2.5 m and multispectral resolution of 10 m. SJ-9B carries longwave
infrared focal plane components for optical imaging with a resolution of 73 m. As
of August 2013, the “SJ” satellite series had developed up to SJ-11E and provided
adequate services for China’s space science and technology experiments (Guo et al.
2013).
3.2.3.5
Remote Sensing from the Shenzhou Spacecraft
China has successfully developed and launched ten Shenzhou spacecraft, represent-
ing the country’s achievements and capability in space science and technology. A
series of scientiﬁc experiments such as space measurement, environmental monitor-
ing, and Earth observation have been carried out in space with the support of the
Shenzhou spacecraft. The Shenzhou spacecraft have accelerated the development of
Earth observation technology in China.
In 2011, China’s ﬁrst space laboratory, Tiangong-1, was successfully launched.
It was the starting point for Chinese space station development and signiﬁed that
China had the ability to build short-term untended space stations. In the same year,
Tiangong-1 successfully docked with the Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft, reveal-
ing that China had achieved a series of key technologies such as space rendezvous
and docking and operation of combined bodies. Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 were
launched in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Shenzhou-11 was launched on October 17,
2016. For the ﬁrst time, China realized space rendezvous and docking of manned
spacecraft, and Chinese astronauts carried out teaching activities in space, marking
an important step forward in China’s space laboratory development (Jiang 2013).
Figure 3.9 shows the development timeline of the Shenzhou series of spacecraft.
3.2.3.6
Commercial Remote Sensing Satellites
China’s government is encouraging more participation from the private sector in
commercial space programs to ensure the sustainable growth of the nation’s space
industry, and some commercial remote sensing satellites and missions have been
launched or are planned, including Jilin-1, Beijing-2, SuperView-1, and Lishui-1.
The Jilin-1 satellites are China’s ﬁrst self-developed remote sensing satellites
for commercial use and were launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center
in northwestern China’s Gansu Province on Oct. 7, 2015. The system includes one
optical remote sensing satellite, two satellites for video imaging and another for
testing imaging techniques. Jilin Province is one of China’s oldest industrial bases
and is developing its satellite industry as a new economic driver. The Jilin-1 GP 01
and 02 satellites for multispectral imaging were launched on a Long March 11 rocket
from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on January 21, 2019. By 2020, the plans

indicate a 60-satellite orbital constellation capable of a 30-min update. From 2030,
the Jilin constellation will have 138 satellites in orbit, forming a 24-h, all-weather,
full-spectrum acquisition segment with the capability of observing any arbitrary point
on the globe with a 10-min revisit capability, providing the world’s highest spatial
and temporal resolution space information products.
The Beijing-2 remote sensing satellite constellation comprises three identical
optical EO satellites, which makes it possible to target any place on Earth once
per day. The constellation provides less than 1-m high-resolution imagery products
with a 23.4-km swath. The constellation was launched on July 10, 2015 from the
Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. The space and ground segments were
designed to efﬁciently deliver timely information. The satellites were developed
by the UK-headquartered Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), which is the
world’s leading small satellite company and part of the Airbus Group. The Twenty
First Century Aerospace Technology Company (21AT) will manage the satellites’
operation,whichincludesobservationandcontrol,datareceptionandproduction,and
related services. The satellites will provide the best combination of spatial resolution
and temporal resolution to stimulate monitoring applications such as urban planning
and intelligent management at a very high resolution. The main parameters of the
constellation are shown in Table 3.15.
The SuperView-1 01 and 02 satellites were launched by one rocket on December
28, 2016, and two better performing satellites will be launched in the future to
comprise four 0.5-m resolution satellites phased 90° from each other on the same
orbit to provide services to global clients.
The Lishui-1 satellites, developed by the privately owned Zhejiang Lishui Elec-
tronic Technology Co Ltd, are commercial remote sensing satellites that were

3.2.4
Other Land Observation Satellites
3.2.4.1
Japan’s Satellites
In 1992, Japan’s ﬁrst Earth resource satellite, JERS-1, was launched into orbit. It
carried next-generation SAR and optical sensors with a ground resolution of 18 m.
During satellite operation, SAR transmits more than 1,500 microwave pulse signals
per second to the surface and receives signals reﬂected from the ground with the
same antenna. The optical sensor is composed of a VNIR radiometer and a shortwave
infrared radiometer, and Earth observation is carried out in eight wavebands. Japan’s
Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS), launched on August 17, 1996, was
a next-generation large-scale Earth observation satellite that followed Japan’s marine
observation satellite, MOS, and Japan’s Earth resource satellite, JERS-1.
On January 24, 2006, the Japan Space Agency launched the ALOS-1 satellite.
ALOS-1 used advanced land observation technologies to obtain ﬂexible, higher res-
olution Earth observation data that could be applied to mapping, regional observation,
disaster monitoring, resource surveys, technical development, and other ﬁelds. The
basic parameters of the ALOS-1 satellite are shown in Table 3.16.
The JAXA completed operation of ALOS-1 on May 12, 2011. The technologies
acquired from ALOS-1 operation were succeeded by the second Advanced Land
Observing Satellite (ALOS-2). The PALSAR-2 on board ALOS-2 is an L-band SAR

tion from the ground to acquire information. The PALSAR-2 has three modes: (1)
Spotlight mode—the most detailed observation mode with 1 by 3 m resolution (25 km
observation width); (2) Strip Map mode—a high-resolution mode with the choice
of 3, 6 or 10 m resolution (observation widths of 50 or 70 km); and (3) ScanSAR
mode—a broad area observation mode with observation widths of 350 or 490 km
and resolution of 100 or 60 m, respectively.
3.2.4.2
India’s Satellites
Resourcesat is part of the Indian remote sensing satellite system. The ﬁrst of the
Resourcesat satellites, Resourcesat-01, was launched on October 17, 2003. This
series is used for disaster forecasting, agriculture, water resources, forest and environ-
ment monitoring, infrastructure development, geological exploration, and mapping
services.
The second satellite of this series, Resourcesat-02, was the 18th remote sensing
satellite designed and developed by ISRO (Fig. 3.10). With a total mass of 1,206 kg,
Resourcesat-02 adopts three-axis stabilization technology and was designed to work
for ﬁve years. Its sensors and related subsystems were jointly developed by the
ISRO Satellite Center (ISAC) and the Space Application Center (SAC). The Indian
NationalRemoteSensingCenter(NRSC)isresponsibleforreceivingandpreprocess-
ing the satellite’s image data as well as for production and distribution of products.
Resourcesat-02 enhanced the Earth observation capability of the country’s remote
sensing satellite system to better serve India’s economic development and national
defense.
Resourcesat-02 replaced Resourcesat-01 after a series of on-orbit tests, and
expanded ISRO’s remote sensing data services. The Resourcesat-02 satellite’s
payload includes: linear imaging self-scanning sensors (LISS-3 and LISS-4), an

advanced wide ﬁeld-of-view sensor (AWIFS), three high-resolution multispectral
cameras, and a marine automatic identiﬁcation system (AIS). LISS-4 has a spatial
resolution of 5.8 m and scanning width of 70 km, can work in the VNIR spectral
range, and can obtain cross-track stereo images (Goward et al. 2012).
3.2.4.3
Russia’s Satellites
The Resurs-F series of satellites are tasked with monitoring crop growth, ice cover,
landforms, and other features. They also undertake scientiﬁc research missions. For
example, the two Resurs-F1 satellites launched in May and July 1989 were passive
atmospheric research satellites, 70 mm in diameter and 78 kg in mass, that were used
to study the density of the upper atmosphere. The two satellites also carried scientiﬁc
instruments from other countries for scientiﬁc experiments.
The ﬁrst Resurs-F satellite was launched on September 5, 1979 from the Plesetsk
Launch Site using an SL-4 rocket. The satellite was 7 m long, 2.4 m in diameter,
6,300 kg in mass and was composed of three compartments. The central part of
the satellite was a 2.3-m diameter sphere that housed the imaging system, electronic
control system, and recovery system. One side was connected to the 3 m long and 2 m
wide propulsion module via a ﬁxing mechanism that unlocked when the retarding
rocket was ignited. The other side was 1.9 m long and the propulsion unit occupied
up to 1.0 m. The propulsion unit was used for orbital adjustment and was cast off
when the return capsule re-entered the atmosphere. The remaining 0.9 m of space was
84
W. Fu et al.
Fig. 3.11 The Resurs-F1 satellite
used to carry additional releasable secondary payloads of up to 30 kg or more. These
secondary payloads could be placed inside or outside the return capsule and carried
back to the ground. An overview of the Resurs-F1 satellite is shown in Fig. 3.11.
The imaging system on board the Resurs-F1 satellite included an SA-20M long-
focuswideimagingsystemwithaKFA-1000cameraandanSA-34widemappingand
imaging system with a KATE-200 camera. Compared with Resurs-F1, the Resurs-F2
satellite’s biggest improvement is the addition of two solar panels, which extended its
service life to nearly one month. The ﬁrst Resurs-F2 satellite, also known as Cosmos-
1906, was launched into space in 1987. However, the launch was unsuccessful and
the satellite was destroyed in orbit. Resurs-F2 satellites are operating in 170–240 km
low Earth orbits and near-polar circular orbits with an orbital inclination of 82.3°.
An outline of the Resurs-F2 satellite is shown in Fig. 3.12.
The Resurs-F2’s imaging system is signiﬁcantly different than that of Resurs-
F1 and includes a KFA-1000 camera and a high-resolution MK-4 mapping camera.
Equipped with a passive remote sensor, the MK-4 camera can record images on
three separate pieces of ﬁlm and perform imaging in any three of the following
six spectral bands: 0.63–0.69 µm, 0.81–0.90 µm, 0.52–0.57 µm, 0.46–0.51 µm,
0.58–0.80 µm, and 0.40–0.70 µm. The camera’s focal length is 300 m, the spatial
resolution is greater than 10 m, the panchromatic spectral resolution is 8 m, and the
ground width is 120–180 km. One scan can generate 2,700 images and the image
size is 180 × 180 mm with an overlap ratio of 60%. The satellite can be used for
mapping, environmental monitoring, and geographic surveys.
The Resurs-O series of satellites were mainly used in geology, cartography, ﬁre
detection, ice detection, hydrology, and agriculture. They were designed and manu-
factured by the then National Institute of Electronics in the former Soviet Union.

Ocean Observation Satellites
Ocean satellites are the best tools for understanding Earth’s oceans, and can be eco-
nomically used for real-time, synchronous, and continuous monitoring of large areas.
At present, ocean satellites are the primary means of marine environment monitor-
ing, making their development a necessity. Ocean satellites can enhance scientists’
capability for marine environment and disaster monitoring, forecasting, and early
warning, and can provide efﬁcient services for marine resource surveying, devel-
opment, and management. These satellites can conduct global surveys of ﬁsheries,
scientiﬁcally estimate ﬁshery potential, and provide a basis for the development
of ﬁshery policies. Furthermore, they can effectively and affordably measure the
marine gravity ﬁeld to provide an understanding of submarine tectonics and oil and
gas reserves, and assist in developing offshore oil ﬁelds.

3.3.1
US Ocean Observation Satellites
3.3.1.1
Development Stages of US Ocean Satellites
The development of US ocean satellites has experienced four stages (Dong 2012): (1)
preparation stage (before 1978); (2) experiment stage (1978–1985); (3) application
research stage (1985–1999), and (4) comprehensive oceanographic observation stage
(1999–present).
(1) Preparation stage
The ﬁrst US meteorological satellite, TIROS-I, was launched by NASA in April
1960, followed by TIROS-II, which started sea surface temperature observation.
In 1961, the United States began to implement the Mercury Program, making it
possible for astronauts to observe the ocean from a high altitude. In 1969, NASA
began to promote a marine observation plan; in 1975, GOES-3 was equipped with an
altimeter for measuring the distance from the satellite to the sea surface. In 1973, the
Skylab space station conﬁrmed the potential of visible and infrared remote sensing
in continuous Earth observation.
(2) Experiment stage
In this stage, marine remote sensors were mainly installed on US ocean satellites such
as Seasat, Nimbus-7, TIROS-N, and GEOS. The main marine elements inversed in
this stage included sea surface temperature, ocean color, and sea ice. In 1981, NOAA
satellites began using the multichannel sea surface temperature (MCSST) algorithm
to forecast sea surface temperature.
(3) Application research stage
The main ocean satellites launched in this stage were equipped with a variety of
microwave monitoring instruments, infrared radiometers and ocean color imagers to
monitor the sea surface, submarine topography, sea waves, sea wind, ocean currents,
marine pollution, primary oceanic productivity, and other factors. In 1985, the United
States launched an ocean topography satellite called Geosat, which was mainly used
to measure signiﬁcant wave height, wind velocity and meso-scale oceanic features.
Over the years, Geosat provided a wide range of altimeter data. Other meteorological
satellites were also involved in marine observation. For instance, NOAA meteoro-
logical satellites were used for sea surface temperature inversion, sea condition mon-
itoring, and sea pollution research. In 1987, the SeaWiFS Working Group of NASA
and the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT) jointly proposed a system-
atic plan for spaceborne wide-ﬁeld-of-view marine observation. In August 1997, the
United States launched an ocean satellite, SeaSTAR, (also called OrbView-2), which
was later included in the EOS program as the ﬁrst ocean color satellite of the program.
Subsequently, the United States developed the navy remote ocean sensing system
(NPOSS) and, in cooperation with France, NASA developed TOPEX/Poseidon for
observing ocean topography.
3
Remote Sensing Satellites for Digital Earth
87
(4) Comprehensive oceanographic observation stage
According to the research objectives of the EOS and ESE, the period from 1999 to
the present is the comprehensive oceanographic observation stage in the develop-
ment of ocean remote sensing. The ﬁrst satellite of the next-generation international
Earth observation satellite system, Terra (EOS-AM1), was launched on December
18, 1999, marking the beginning of a new era of human observation of Earth. The
second polar-orbiting environmental remote sensing satellite, Aqua (EOS-PM1),
was launched on May 4, 2002. Both Terra and Aqua are equipped with a Moder-
ate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that has 36 wavebands ranging
from visible to thermal infrared light, nine of which can be used for ocean color
remote sensing. Compared with SeaWiFS, MODIS is more advanced and is known
as the third-generation ocean color (and meteorological element) sensor (DeVisser
2013). The Jason program was proposed to meet the requirements for establishing
a global marine observation system and the demands of oceanic and climatological
research. The Jason-2 ocean altimetry satellite (also used for accurate determination
of ocean topography) was jointly developed by the Centre National d’Etudes Spa-
tiales (CNES), EUMETSAT, NASA, and NOAA and launched on June 20, 2008. As
a follow-up to TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1, it is an important observation platform
for global oceanographic studies.
3.3.1.2
Typical US Ocean Satellite Systems
(1) Seasat-1
Launched on June 27, 1978, Seasat-1 operated on orbit for 105 days and stopped
working on October 10, 1978, due to an electrical system fault. It was launched to
demonstrate global monitoring technologies including the observation of oceanic
dynamics and satellite orbit characteristics and to provide oceanographic data for the
development and application of an operational ocean dynamics monitoring system.
Seasat-1 was the ﬁrst ocean satellite to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for
ocean observation by means of remote sensing (Fig. 3.13). Its purpose was to prove
the feasibility of using satellites to monitor global oceanic phenomena and help
determine the requirements of ocean remote sensing satellite systems. The goal was
to collect data about ocean surface wind, sea surface temperature, atmospheric water,
sea ice characteristics, ocean topography, and similar parameters. Seasat-1 could
cover 95% of the world in a 36-h observation cycle.
(2) OrbView-2
Also called SeaStar, OrbView-2 was launched into a 705 km sun-synchronous orbit
on August 1, 1997. The mass of the parent capsule was 155 kg, the mass of the
instruments was 45.4 kg, and that of the satellite was 317 kg. The outer dimensions
of the satellite were 1.15 × 0.96 × 1.6 m, and the solar wing plate had a span of
3.5 m when unfolded (Fig. 3.14).
88
W. Fu et al.
Fig. 3.13 Seasat-1
The satellite carried only one remote sensing instrument, SeaWiFS, which could
monitor ocean color, generate multispectral images of the land and sea surface, and
analyze the impacts of ocean color changes on the global environment, atmosphere,
carbon cycle, and other ecological cycles. SeaWiFS consisted of optical remote
sensors and an electronic module, and the satellite covered the global ocean area
once every two days.
OrbView-2 was the world’s ﬁrst satellite that could generate color images of the
Earth every day. The imager had eight spectral segments, six of which were visible
and two of which were near infrared. With a spatial resolution of 1.1 km and a
2,800 km scanning width, OrbView-2 data could be used in the ﬁshing industry,
agriculture, scientiﬁc research, and environmental monitoring.
(3) Jason-1
As an ocean satellite, Jason-1 is used to study the relationship between the ocean and
the atmosphere, monitor global ocean circulation, improve global weather prediction
and forecasting, and monitor El Niño, ocean eddies, and other events (Chander et al.
2012). With a total weight of 500 kg and payload of 120 kg, Jason-1 was launched on
December7,2001(Fig.3.15).Itwastheworld’sﬁrstsatellitetousetheFrenchAlcatel
PROTEUS multifunctional microplatform and carried ﬁve scientiﬁc instruments:
one dual-frequency solid-state spaceborne radar altimeter (Poseidon-2), which was
the main payload of Jason-1, one triple-channel microwave radiometer (JMR) used
to measure atmospheric water vapor content and provide water vapor correction
for the radar altimeter, and three other instruments for accurate orbit determination
that comprise one Doppler orbitography by radio positioning integrated by satellite

As the main payload of the Jason-1 satellite, Poseidon-2 was developed by the
CNES as an improved model of the Poseidon-1 radar altimeter. In addition to inherit-
ing all the advantages of its predecessor, Poseidon-2 used dual-frequency technology,
with working frequencies of 13.575 GHz (Ku-band) and 5.3 GHz (C-band). Com-
pared to other radar altimeters, Poseidon-2 was smaller in volume and lighter weight
and had more efﬁcient power consumption. It is mainly used to measure sea surface
height, wind velocity, signiﬁcant wave height, and ionospheric corrections. The main
technical parameters of the Poseidon-2 radar altimeter are shown in Table 3.17.

European Ocean Observation Satellites
The successful launch of the ﬁrst meteorological satellite, Meteosat, in 1977 marked
the beginning of the implementation of the European Earth Observation Program
(EOP). The main task of Meteosat was to monitor the atmosphere over Europe and
Africa. Implementation of the ERS missions in the early 1990s marked the EOP’s
entry into a new stage. The launch of an ENVISAT satellite in 2002 sped up the pace
of EOP implementation. The ESA proposed the Living Planet Programme (LPP)
in 1998. Compared with the ERS and ENVISAT missions, the LPP used smaller
satellites, was less costly and had better deﬁned targets.
3.3.2.1
ERS-1/2
The ERS-1/2 satellites operated on a near-polar sun-synchronous orbit, with an aver-
age orbital altitude of 785 km and an orbital inclination of 98.50°. The local time
when the satellite moved from north to south across the equator was 10:30 AM. The
ERS-1 launch involved a number of adjustments to the orbital altitude instruments.
The three months after launch, the satellite used a three-day period for trial operation
at an orbital altitude of 785 km (reference orbit). The orbital adjustment period of
the sun-synchronous satellite was 3–176 days, and the main working period was
35 days. The average orbital altitude for the three-day period was 785 km, the orbital
altitude above the equator was 909 km, and the satellite circled Earth 43 times. The
main parameters of ERS-1/2 are shown in Table 3.18.
The satellite platform carried the following seven instruments (Fig. 3.16): (1)
an active microwave instrument (AMI) with an SAR that had a 100-km mapping
swath; (2) a wind scatterometer that used three groups of antennas to measure the
direction and velocity of sea surface winds; (3) a radar altimeter that was used to
accurately measure sea surface topography and elevation, wave height, sea surface
wind velocity, and characteristics of sea ice; (4) an orbit-tracking scanning radiome-
ter and microwave sounder; (5) a precision ranging velocimeter that was used to
accurately measure the satellite position, orbital characteristics, and the position of
ﬁxed ground stations; (6) a laser reﬂector that used laser beams emitted from the

At the time, the ASAR on board ENVISAT was the world’s most advanced space-
borne SAR sensor with new features including multipolarization, multiple modes,
and multiple incident angles. The ground resolution of data reached 25 m, and the
widest coverage was 400 km. The multipolarization SAR imaging system could
acquirecopolarizationandcross-polarizationinformationofgroundobjectsandmore
accurately detect features of a target. The ﬁve working modes and characteristics of
the ENVISAT satellite’s ASAR sensor are listed in Table 3.19.

3.3.2.3
The Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation
Explorer (GOCE)
The GOCE was a satellite that adopted new technologies to map the Earth’s grav-
itational ﬁeld (Fig. 3.18). The GOCE was launched on March 17, 2009 (Metzler
and Pail 2005). The satellite started scientiﬁc observation activities on September
30, 2009 and carried out its functions during its service life. In October 2010, the
ﬁrst batch of GOCE satellite data was released freely to scientiﬁc researchers and
noncommercial users across the world, opening up a new historical period for Earth
gravity ﬁeld research.
The GOCE moved on a low, nearly-circular, twilight sun-synchronous orbit. The
orbital plane’s eccentricity was less than 0.001 and its inclination was 96.7°, leaving a
nonobservable area with a spherical radius of approximately 6.7° in the northern and
southern polar regions. The satellite’s working time was twenty months, including
three months of commissioning and calibration followed by a period of scientiﬁc
measurement and period of dormancy. Due to its energy supply, trial operation,
gradiometer calibration, orbital adjustment and other reasons, the time period for
scientiﬁc observation was only twelve months. Once the satellite’s working time
period had expired, it was decided to extend the GOCE’s operational period based
on the working state of all systems and the quality of data products obtained. The
original plan was to extend the mission by ten months and increase the observation
tasks accordingly (Floberghagen et al. 2011).
The goal of the GOCE mission was to provide a high-precision, high-resolution
static Earth gravity model (Bouman et al. 2009). Such models can be obtained based
Fig. 3.18 GOCE

on the gravity gradient and GPS tracking data. The speciﬁc goals were to: determine
global gravity anomalies with a precision of 1 mGal, determine the global geoid with
a precision of 1–2 cm, and fulﬁl these goals with a spatial resolution above 100 km
(half-wavelength) (Visser 2010; Gooding et al. 2007).
3.3.3
China’s Ocean Observation Satellites
China’s ﬁrst independently developed ocean satellite, HY-1A, was launched on May
15, 2002. As an experimental satellite, HY-1A was used to monitor ocean color
and temperature. HY-1B was launched on April 11, 2007, and was positioned for
operation on September 3. HY-1B was the successor to HY-1A, with a design life
of three years, and its technical indicators and functions were superior to those of
HY-1A. The HY-2A satellite was launched on August 16, 2011. As a marine dynamic
environment satellite, HY-2 worked to detect the sea surface wind ﬁeld, temperature
ﬁeld, sea surface height, wave ﬁeld, and ﬂow ﬁeld. It adopted the platform of the
ZY-1 satellite. A roadmap of ocean satellite development is shown in Fig. 3.19.
(1) HY-1A
The ten-band Chinese ocean color and temperature scanner (COCTS) was used
to detect ocean color environmental factors (concentration of chlorophyll, content
of suspended sediments, and presence of soluble organic matter) and temperature
ﬁeld. The satellite had a nadir ground resolution of 1,100 m, 1,024 pixels per line,

(2) HY-1B
As the successor of HY-1A, the HY-1B ocean satellite was launched on April 11,
2007, and had a design life of three years. Its payload parameters are shown in
Table 3.20 (National Satellite Ocean Application Service 2007, 2011). HY-1B moni-
tors the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and their
coastal zones to detect chlorophyll, suspended sediments, soluble organic matter, and
sea surface temperature.
(3) HY-2A
The HY-2A ocean satellite was China’s ﬁrst marine dynamic environment satel-
lite to integrate active and passive microwave remote sensors and is capable of
high-precision orbital measurement and determination, and all-weather, 24-h global
detection. Its mission is to monitor and investigate marine environments and obtain
dynamic ocean environment parameters including sea surface wind, wave height,
ocean current, and sea surface temperature. HY-2A also provides data for the pre-
warning and forecasting of disastrous sea conditions, and offers supportive services
for the prevention and mitigation of marine disasters, protection of marine rights and
interests, development of marine resources, protection of the marine environment,
marine scientiﬁc research, and national defense. HY-2A was launched at 06:57 on
August 16, 2011 from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center using a CZ-4B rocket.
The satellite is equipped with a scanning microwave radiometer, a radar altime-
ter, a microwave scatterometer, a calibrated microwave radiometer, DORIS, dual-
frequency GPS, and a laser range ﬁnder. The parameters of the radar altimeter are
shown in Table 3.21.

Other Ocean Observation Satellites
In addition to the United States and the ESA, Russia, Japan, Canada, and India have
launched various ocean satellites into space. Generally, modern ocean satellites have
an accurately determined sun-synchronous orbit, use a variety of remote sensors for
measurement, and adopt a comprehensive remote sensing platform.
3.3.4.1
Japan’s Satellites
On February 19, 1987, Japan launched its ﬁrst ocean observation satellite, MOS-1,
on an N-l rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center (Fig. 3.20).
MOS-1 was loaded with two optical remote sensors: a multispectral electronic
self-scanningradiometer(MESSR)andavisiblethermalinfraredradiometer(VTIR).
Other payloads included a microwave scanning radiometer (MSR), a data collection
system (DCS), and a visible thermal infrared repeater. The MESSR is an electronic
scanning optical observation remote sensor that uses a CCD to capture land and ocean
information. Wavelengths ranging from visible light to near infrared are divided into
four spectral bands (see Table 3.22). On board the satellite were two identical devices

India’s Satellites
OceanSat-1 was launched for the study of marine physics and marine biology on
May 26, 1999 using a PSLV-C2 rocket (Dash et al. 2012). It was equipped with an
ocean color monitor (OCM) and a multifrequency scanning microwave radiometer
(MSMR) (Fig. 3.21). The OCM was used to collect data and worked at 402–422 nm,
433–453 nm, 480–500 nm, 500–520 nm, 545–565 nm, 660–689 nm, 745–785 nm,
and 845–885 nm with a spatial resolution of 360 m and width of 1,420 km.
OceanSat-2 was launched on September 23, 2009 using a PSLV-C14 rocket. It
functions on a circular near-polar sun-synchronous orbit 720 km above Earth, and
continuously provides effective IRS-P4 services (Gohil et al. 2013; Sathiyamoor-
thy et al. 2012). The observation data from OceanSat-2 are applied to new areas
of ocean research such as tornado trajectory prediction, coastal area mapping, and
atmospheric research. The OCM and ROSA provide several geophysical parameters
such as suspended sediment, yellow matter, phytoplankton, sea surface temperature
(SST), sea wind, sea conditions, signiﬁcant wave height, and atmospheric proﬁles
derived from GPS radio occultation.

Russia’s Satellites
Since 1979, the Soviet Union/Russian Federation has launched a series of ocean
color satellites known as the Okean-O1 series of satellites for marine and polar
ice observation (Fig. 3.22). Twelve Okean-O1 satellites were launched (including
one launch failure) by the end of August 1995 and four satellites were launched
betweenMay1988andOctober1994,referredtoasOkean-1toOkean-4.Thesatellite
payloads included an X-band side-looking radar with 350/1,500 m resolution and
1,380/1,930 km scanning width, and a microwave radiometer with an 8 mm working

frequency and a 550 km scanning width. The Okean-O1 series of satellites functioned
at an orbital altitude of 650 km and an inclination of 82.5°. Each satellite weighed
1.95 t and had a design life ranging from six months to a year. In 1999, Russia
launched a new type of ocean satellite, Okean-O, whose design life and weight were
increased to three years and 6.5 t, respectively. The Okean-O series of satellites
adopted a sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude and inclination of 670 km and
98°, respectively. Each satellite was equipped with nine remote sensors, leading to
improved optical resolution (25–200 m for visible light and 100–600 m for infrared).
3.3.4.4
Canada’s Satellites
RADARSAT is a joint research project conducted by Canada (Canadian Space
Agency/Canada Centre for Remote Sensing) and the United States (NASA). The
radar is designed to provide detailed information for sea ice, land ice, and climate
studies, and the radar images can be used in ﬁelds such as oceanography, agriculture,
forestry, hydrology, geology, and geography and to provide real-time ice surveillance
of the Arctic ocean.
RADARSAT-1 was launched by Canada on November 4, 1995 (Fig. 3.23).
Satellite-borne SAR is an active remote sensing device. Because it actively emits
electromagneticwavestoobtaininformation,itcanpenetratecloudsandfogandover-
come night barriers and is capable of all-weather, 24-h observation. It can observe the
surface on a regular basis and obtain real-time observation data. The SAR on board

seven working modes used for coastal zone observation, sea ice monitoring, topo-
graphic surveys, and other uses.
RADARSAT-2 was launched in December 2007 as Canada’s next-generation
commercial radar satellite offering powerful technical advancements for mapping in
Canada and around the world. This satellite is a follow-up to RADARSAT-1. It has
the same orbit and is separated by half an orbit period (~50 min) from RADARSAT-1
(in terms of the ground track, this represents ~12 days of separation). RADARSAT-2
is a C-band imaging radar system, with a nominal imaging swath from 20 to 500 km,
incidence angles from 10° to 60°, and fully polarimetric imaging capability; it is an
indispensable tool for managing natural resources and monitoring the environment
in the twenty-ﬁrst century. It ﬁlls a wide variety of roles, including in sea ice mapping
and ship routing, iceberg detection, agricultural crop monitoring, marine surveillance
for ship and pollution detection, terrestrial defense surveillance and target identiﬁ-
cation, geological mapping, land use mapping, wetlands mapping, and topographic
mapping.

Meteorological Observation Satellites
Meteorological satellites have become an indispensable part of the basic and strate-
gic resources for national economic and social development in countries across the
world. As the problems of environmental pollution, resource shortages, and natural
disasters become increasingly worse, the role of meteorological satellites in weather
forecasting, environmental monitoring, and disaster mitigation and prevention has
become more important than ever.
3.4.1
US Meteorological Observation Satellites
Since the launch of its ﬁrst meteorological satellite in April 1960, the United States
has developed two series of meteorological satellites: geostationary meteorological
satellitesandpolar-orbitingmeteorologicalsatellites.TheformeristheGeostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series and the latter comprises NOAA
satellites in the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).
3.4.1.1
The DMSP Satellite System
DMSP satellites operate on sun-synchronous orbits. Some of the orbital parameters
are listed in Table 3.23.
The DMSP satellite series adopts a double-satellite operation system. One satellite
operates on a 06:00 AM orbit and the other on a 10:30 AM orbit, both with a repeat
observation cycle of twelve hours and seven payloads, which are shown in Table 3.24.

The DMSP satellite series uses two data transmission modes: direct reading mode
and storage mode. The former can transmit data to the ground station in real time
and the latter transmits the data stored in the satellite-borne magnetic tape unit to the
ground station when the satellite is ﬂying over it. These ground stations include the
Fairchild Air Force Base in the state of Washington, the Loring Air Force Base in
Maine, and the Ka’ena Point Satellite Tracking Station in Hawaii. Then, the ground
stations transmit the data, via relay satellites, to the Air Force Global Weather Cen-
ter (AFG-WC) at the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and the Fleet Numerical
Oceanographic Center (FNOC) in Monterey, California.
3.4.1.2
The NOAA Satellite System (POES)
Satellites of the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) system
operate on sun-synchronous orbits. The NOAA satellite system adopts a double-
satellite operation system. The local time of the orbit descending node of one of the
satellites is in the morning, and that of the other is in the afternoon. Currently, the
POES system satellites carry six kinds of payloads, which are shown in Table 3.25.

In these payloads, AVHRR/3 is used to detect clouds, and cloud-top, sea surface
and land surface temperatures. Its channel characteristics are shown in Table 3.26.
HIRS/3 is used to sound the vertical proﬁles of atmospheric temperature and
humidity on cloudless or partly cloudy days. With a quantization level of 13 bits, the
instrument has 20 channels and a resolution of 17.4 km.
AMSU consists of AMSU-A and AMSU-B. AMSU can sound temperature and
humidity on cloudy days, sound precipitation on the land and sea, recognize sea ice
and determine its scope, and sound soil moisture to a certain degree.
SEM is used to measure solar protons, alpha particles, electron ﬂux density, the
energy spectrum, and the total particle energy distribution in the satellite orbit to
study the satellite’s physical environment in space, predict proton events, and ensure
the safe operation of spacecraft working in orbit.
ERBS is used to observe incident solar shortwave radiation, solar shortwave radi-
ation reﬂected to outer space, and longwave radiation transmitted from the Earth-
atmosphere system. SBUV is used to measure the total amount and vertical distri-
bution of ozone. The instrument detects the 160–400 nm band and measures two
aspects: the ultraviolet backscatter of the atmosphere in the O3 absorption band and
the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun.

vertical sounder, and the imager can perform sounding separately at the same time.
There are four main kinds of payloads. The orbital information and payloads of the
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellites currently in

European Meteorological Observation Satellites
The European meteorological satellite program began in 1972. The initial goals
of the program were to meet European countries’ need for weather analysis and
forecasting and meet the demand for global atmospheric monitoring and research in
accordance with the WMO’s World Weather Watch (WWW) program and the Global
Atmospheric Research Program (GARP).
3.4.2.1
Typical Geostationary Meteorological Satellites of Europe
The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
(EUMETSAT) has launched ten Meteosat satellites since the ﬁrst geostationary mete-
orological Meteosat satellite was launched in November 1977. The European geo-
stationary meteorological satellites are the Meteosat series of satellites launched by
EUMETSAT; Meteosat-7 belongs to the ﬁrst generation (Fig. 3.24) and Meteosat-8,
Meteosat-9 and Meteosat-10 belong to the second generation.
The main instrument installed on the ﬁrst generation of Meteosat operational
satellites is a three-channel imager, MVIRI. The parameters of each channel are
listed in Table 3.28. The satellites’ main tasks are to (1) provide 48 full-disk images
of Earth daily; (2) transmit near-real time digital and analog images to primary data
user stations and secondary data user stations; (3) relay image data transmitted from

other meteorological satellites; (4) collect data transmitted from the data acquisition
platform; (5) send meteorological products to users; and (6) perform meteorological
data distribution (MDD), which is mainly intended to improve the transmission of
African meteorological data.
The second-generation Meteosat satellites entered Phase A (system design phase)
before 1993 and entered Phase B (sample satellite development phase) soon after.
Phase C was developed as the launch and implementation phase, and Phase D was
the postlaunch application and improvement phase.
MSG is a spin-stabilized satellite (Fig. 3.25), similar to the ﬁrst generation of
meteorological satellites. Its design was improved in many aspects. For instance,
the satellite-borne radiometer SEVIRI has much higher performance, the spectral
channels were increased from three to twelve, the resolution was greatly improved
(1 km in the wideband high-resolution visible light channel), and the scanning time
was halved from thirty minutes to ﬁfteen minutes. The data transmission system was
also improved, making data transmission and broadcast much faster (3.2 Mbps and
1 Mbps, respectively).

Polar-Orbiting Meteorological Satellite System
The European Union’s polar-orbiting meteorological satellite system, MetOp, and
EUMETSAT teams are working closely together to develop a European polar-
orbiting meteorological satellite system and launch the MetOp series of satellites
which, starting in 2002, began replacing older meteorological satellites (TIROS
series) launched earlier by NOAA. Satellites owned and operated by EUMETSAT
will be part of an American-European three-satellite operating system, in which one
US satellite will appear at dawn, MetOp will appear in the morning and another US
satellite will appear in the early afternoon.
MetOp is being designed to carry instruments provided by the ESA, EUMET-
SAT, NOAA, and CNES. These satellites have a larger carrying capacity, improved
payload, and better performance than the NOAA system. The MetOp series consists
of three satellites; the ﬁrst, MetOp-A (Fig. 3.26), was launched on October 19, 2006,
with a design life of ﬁve years and the second, MetOp-B (Fig. 3.27), was launched
on September 1, 2012.
The EUMETSAT polar-orbiting satellite system is an integral part of the global
observing system (GOS) that is designed to provide long-term global observation

data in conjunction with NOAA satellites. The operational instruments on board the
EUMETSAT polar-orbiting system are designed to be the same as those on board
NOAA satellites to ensure the consistency of observation data. The ﬁrst one or two
satellites are large-capacity, nonoperational polar-orbiting platforms (EPOP/POEM),
and subsequent satellites are smaller MetOp satellites.

China’s Meteorological Observation Satellites
China’s polar-orbiting meteorological satellites (FY-1 and FY-3 satellite series) are
also referred to as sun-synchronous orbiting meteorological satellites, those whose
orbital plane is usually 98°–99° from the equatorial plane and whose orbit crosses
the north and south poles. Geostationary meteorological satellites (FY-2 satellite
series) move at the same speed as Earth’s rotation at an altitude of 36,000 km above
the equator. Information on the FY satellite series is shown in Fig. 3.28 (National
Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration 2013a).
3.4.3.1
Polar-Orbiting Satellites
(1) FY-1A/1B
FY-1A was launched on September 7, 1988, as an experimental meteorological satel-
lite. Although it only worked in orbit for 39 days due to a control system failure,
the successful launch of FY-1A was considered a milestone in China’s development
of meteorological satellites. The satellite was equipped with an infrared and visible
light scanning radiometer, a data collection system, a space environment detector,
and other instruments. Technical parameters of the multispectral infrared and visible
light scanning radiometer are shown in Table 3.29 (National Satellite Meteorological
Center, China Meteorological Administration 2013b).

0.6654 Mbps and the operating frequency is
1,670–1,710 MHz. In low-resolution image transmission
(APT), delay picture transmission (DPT), high-resolution
picture transmission (APT) and DPT are analog signals
The FY-1B satellite was successfully launched on September 3, 1990. As China’s
second experimental meteorological satellite, FY-1B was an improvement over FY-
1A. Compared with FY-1A, FY-1B’s attitude control system was improved and its
visible cloud images were clearer. The performance of the satellite’s sensors and
the main functions of the satellite were similar to those of the United States’ third-
generation polar-orbit meteorological satellites. The satellite’s performance was at
a level similar to that of commercial applications, its visible channel image quality
was high, and its signal-to-noise ratio was above the design requirement. However,
the satellite’s system lacked reliability.
(2) FY-1C
FY-1C was successfully launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre on May
10, 1999. Compared with FY-1A/B, the FY-1C satellite had signiﬁcantly improved
performance, with increased detection channels and accuracy. Its design life was
two years. A series of technical measures were taken that led to improvements in the
product quality, adaptability to space environments, and system reliability. FY-1C
functioned stably in orbit until June 24, 2004, when the reception of FY-1C cloud
images ceased.
The satellite was equipped with a space particle composition detector and a mul-
tichannel visible infrared scanning radiometer (MVISR). The number of MVISR
channels for FY-1C was increased from ﬁve (FY-1A) to ten, and included four visi-
ble light channels, one shortwave infrared channel, and two longwave infrared chan-
nels. Table 3.30 lists the wavelength and use of each channel. The ﬁeld of view was
1.2 microradians, the nadir resolution was 1.1 km, and the scanning speed was six
scan lines per second, with each line containing 20,480 pixel points. The calibration

accuracy of the visible and near infrared channels reached 10%, and the infrared
radiometric calibration accuracy reached 1 K, as technically required. The spatial
resolution of the HRPT and GDPT images was greater than 1.1 km and 4 km, respec-
tively. The Chinese high-resolution picture transmission (CHRPT) had a frequency
of 1,700 MHz, a bit rate of l.3308 Mbps, and real-time reception from anywhere in
the world. The delay picture transmission (DPT) had a frequency of 1,708 MHz and
a bit rate of 1.3308 Mbps and was divided into two types: GDPT and LDPT (National
Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration 2013b).
(3) FY-1D
Design of the FY-1D ﬂight model began in 2000 based on FY-1C technology and pre-
vious experience. Fourteen technical improvements were made that led to improved
stability. The 950 kg satellite was launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center
on May 15, 2002, using an LM-4B rocket. FY-1D functioned normally for ten years,
exceeding its design life and completing all tasks. It is no longer in operation.
FY-1D’s main onboard sensor was a multichannel visible infrared scanning
radiometer (MVISR), whose main technical parameters are listed in Table 3.31.
Data were transmitted using two methods: HRPT and DPT. The HRPT’s bit rate was
1.3308 Mbps, and the carrier frequency was 1,700.4 MHz. The DPT’s bit rate was
1.3308 Mbps, and the carrier frequency was 1,708.46 MHz. Global meteorological
data could be acquired through four channels (Channels 1, 2, 4 and 5), with a spatial
resolution of 3.3 km (National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological
Administration 2013b).
(4) FY-3A
The FY-3 satellites (FY-3) were China’s second-generation polar-orbiting meteoro-
logical satellites used for weather forecasting, climate prediction, and environmental
monitoring. The FY-3 series comprised two satellites: FY-3A and FY-3B. The satel-
lites were used to conduct 3D atmospheric detection, greatly improved China’s ability

Data transmission
For high-resolution picture transmission (HRPT), the bit rate is
0.6654 Mbps and the operating frequency is
1,670–1,710 MHz. In low-resolution image transmission
(APT), delay picture transmission (DPT), high-resolution
picture transmission (APT) and DPT are analog signals
to acquire global information and further enhanced its cloud area and surface fea-
ture remote sensing capabilities. These features enabled the country to obtain global,
all-weather, three-dimensional, quantitative, multispectral data on atmospheric, land
surface, and sea surface characteristics.
FY-3A was the ﬁrst FY-3 meteorological satellite launched using an LM-4C rocket
from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center at 11:02 on May 27, 2008. Although it was
developedbasedontheFY-1meteorologicalsatellites,FY-3Awassubstantiallysupe-
rior in both technology and function. The satellite was capable of three-dimensional
atmospheric detection, greatly improving the capability for global information acqui-
sition and cloud area and surface feature remote sensing.
(5) FY-3B
FY-3B is the second satellite in the FY-3 meteorological satellite series. It was
launched from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in the early morning of Novem-
ber 5, 2010, using an LM-4C rocket. FY-3B is China’s ﬁrst afternoon-orbit meteoro-
logical satellite, making it the ﬁrst polar-orbiting meteorological satellite to conduct
observations at this time. FY-3B is useful for accurate monitoring and numerical fore-
casting of rainstorms in southern China that usually occur in the afternoon. Working
in conjunction, FY-3B and FY-3A increased the global scan frequency from twice a
day to four times a day. Thus, China’s ability to monitor disastrous weather events
such as typhoons and thunderstorms was enhanced markedly. The satellite had a
design life of three years but is still operating in orbit.
FY-3B is equipped with eleven advanced remote sensing instruments and 99 spec-
tral detection channels, ﬁve of which have a resolution of 250 m. FY-3B is similar
3
Remote Sensing Satellites for Digital Earth
111
to FY-3A in terms of the satellite platform, payload conﬁguration, and main per-
formance parameters. However, as the ﬁrst next-generation, polar-orbiting mete-
orological satellite, FY-3A showed weak operation of some onboard instruments.
FY-3B was developed by meteorological satellite experts based on their experience
acquired from the development of the FY-3A satellite. As a result, FY-3B demon-
strated improved performance for the infrared spectrometer, microwave radiation
imager, and solar backscatter ultraviolet sounder.
(6) FY-3C/3D
FY-3C is a sun-synchronous orbit satellite launched on September 23, 2013 by the
carrier rocket Chinese Long March 4C from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in
Shanxi province. The FY-3C orbital satellite joins its predecessors FY-3A and FY-3B.
It replaced FY-3A to operate, after undergoing tests, in a morning orbit with FY-2B,
which is in an afternoon orbit, to provide temporal resolution of global observation
data of up to six hours.
The FY-3C missions primarily include Earth surface imaging and atmospheric
sounding, and its observational data will be used in weather forecasting, and in
monitoring of natural disasters and ecological and environmental factors. Compared
with FY-3A and FY-3B, the payload on board FY-3C features 12 sensing instru-
ments, including a visible infrared radiometer, a microwave scanning radiometer, a
microwave temperature sounder (MWTS), a microwave humidity sounder (MWHS),
a microwave imager, and a medium resolution imaging spectrometer. It also includes
a UV-O-zone sounder, a total O-zone UV detector, a solar radiation and Earth radia-
tion detector, space environmental monitoring suits, and GNSS occultation detectors.
FY-3D was launched on November 14, 2017 as China’s fourth second-generation
polar-orbiting meteorological satellite and will replace the orbiting FY-3B satellite.
The satellite is designed to provide weather forecasts in medium- and long-range
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling high-impact weather fore-
casting up to a week in advance, and alleviate the impacts of natural disasters on the
economy and society and improve livelihood.
Equipped with greenhouse gas probing capacity, FY-3D was also developed
to help tackle climate change, in addition to serving ecological, civilization, and
construction needs and the ‘Belt and Road’ initiative. FY-3D features ten instru-
ments, including a microwave temperature sounder (MWTS), a microwave humidity
sounder (MHTS), a microwave radiation imager (MWRI), a space environment mon-
itor (SEM), and a global navigation satellite system occultation sounder (GNOS).
3.4.3.2
Geostationary Orbit Satellites
(1) FY-2A/2B
The FY-2A satellite was the ﬁrst experimental satellite in China’s ﬁrst-generation
geostationary meteorological satellite series, FY-2, and was launched on June 10,
1997. FY-2A had a three-channel scanning radiometer and a design life of three
112
W. Fu et al.
years at a stable spinning altitude. The satellite began to have issues after working
for three months and then worked intermittently, only operating for six to eight
hours each day. Ultimately, FY-2A failed to meet the requirements for commercial
meteorological services.
The main payload of FY-2A was a visible and infrared spin-scan radiometer
(VISSR), whose technical parameters are shown in Table 3.32 (National Satellite
Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration 2013b).
The FY-2B satellite was the second experimental satellite in China’s ﬁrst-
generation geostationary meteorological satellite FY-2 series. FY-2B was launched
on June 25, 2000 from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center using an LM-3 rocket.
The ﬁrst original cloud image was received on July 6. FY-2B only had a three-channel
scanning radiometer and a design life of three years in a stable spinning altitude. It
functioned in orbit for less than eight months before a problem occurred with one
of the components on board the satellite; from then onward, the signals it sent back
were too weak to receive. Ultimately, FY-2B failed to meet the requirements for
commercial meteorological services. However, FY-2B’s operation provided valu-
able experience for the development of subsequent FY-2 meteorological satellites.
The technical parameters of the FY-2B and FY-2A satellites were identical. The
cloud images sent from FY-2B played an important role in monitoring typhoons and
marine weather, forecasting rainstorms, preventing ﬂoods, analyzing the weather
system above the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, providing meteorological support for
aviation, and predicting climate change.
(2) FY-2C/2D/2E/2F/2G/2H
FY-2C was the ﬁrst commercial-use satellite in the FY-2 meteorological satellite
series. After a successful launch on October 19, 2004, FY-2C was positioned at
an altitude of 36,000 km above the equator at 105° east longitude on October 24.

FY-2C occupied FY-2B’s former position to monitor weather conditions in the Asia
Paciﬁc Region. Four days after it was positioned, adjustments were made to the
groundapplicationsystemtotechnicallycoordinateitwiththesatellite.Thesatellite’s
service monitoring, data transmission, and forwarding channels were opened, and the
scanning radiometer was switched on. FY-2C could observe changes in sea surface
temperature, and one of its channels was designed for measuring 3.5–4 µm light
waves to observe high-temperature heat sources on the ground. It was possible to use
spectral channels to observe ground heat sources to promptly discover forest ﬁres in
remote and desolate places, monitor their situation, and predict their development
trends.
FY-2D was the fourth satellite in the FY-2 meteorological satellite series. FY-2D
was also the country’s second application-oriented geostationary-orbiting meteoro-
logical satellite. It was launched using an LM-3A rocket at 08:53 on December 8,
2006. After 1,421 s of ﬂying, it successfully separated from the rocket, entering
into a large elliptical transfer orbit with a perigee altitude of 202 km, apogee alti-
tude of 36,525 km, and inclination of 24.97°. At 01:24 on December 9, the apogee
engine was ignited for orbital transfer, and secondary separation was successfully
completed. After four batches of orbit trimming, the satellite was positioned at an
altitude of 36,000 km above the equator at 86.5° E longitude at 17:00 on December
13. It is currently no longer in operation.
On December 23, 2008, and January 13, 2012, China’s third and fourth service-
orientedgeostationarymeteorologicalsatellites,FY-2EandFY-2F,respectively,were
launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center using LM-3A rockets. The two
satellites were of great signiﬁcance for the continuous and stable operation of China’s
geostationary meteorological satellite observation services. FY-2F boasted ﬂexible
capability for scanning speciﬁc regions with a high temporal resolution and could
monitor disastrous weather conditions such as typhoons and severe convections. FY-
2F played an important role in China’s meteorological disaster monitoring, early
warning, prevention, and mitigation. The space environment monitor continuously
monitored solar X-rays and the ﬂow of high-energy protons, electrons, and heavy
particles, and the data were used for space weather monitoring, forecasting, and early
warning services.
The geostationary meteorological satellites FY-2C, FY-2D, FY-2E, and FY-2F
working in orbit formed a “double-satellite observation with mutual backup” ser-
vice pattern. These satellites helped modernize China’s comprehensive meteorolog-
ical observation system. During ﬂood season, the double-satellite observation mode
allowed for spinning the satellite, enabling it to provide a cloud picture every ﬁfteen
minutes. This intensiﬁed observation mode played a key role in monitoring disas-
trous weather systems such as typhoons, rainstorms, thunderstorms, and small- and
medium-scale local convective systems. The FY-2 meteorological satellite series
played a crucial role in combating heavy rain, freezing snow, and other extreme
weather events. The satellites also provided assistance in the Wenchuan earthquake
relief operations and in providing meteorological services for the Beijing Olympics
and Paralympics.
114
W. Fu et al.
The FY-2G satellite was launched on December 31, 2014 from the Xichang
Satellite Launch Center. Based on the technology of FY-2 F satellite, the FY-2G
satellite was improved by reducing infrared stray radiation, uplifting the observa-
tion frequency for the blackbody, and improving the telemetry resolution of optical
components. These improvements increase the retrieval accuracy of FY-2G satel-
lite quantitative products and enhance the quantitative application of satellite data
products.
FY-2H was launched on June 5, 2018. It is positioned over the Indian Ocean
and has realized the sustained observation of one-third of the Earth’s territories
from Oceania to central Africa. It can provide favorable observation perspectives
and custom-made high-frequency subregional observation for countries and regions
such as western Asia, central Asia, Africa, and Europe. Equipped with a scanning
radiometer and a space environment monitor, FY-2H can supply data for dozens of
remote sensing products such as cloud images, clear sky atmospheric radiation, sand
and dust, and cloud motion wind (CMW) for weather prediction, disaster warning,
and environmental monitoring, enriching the data sources for global NWP models.
The main payload of FY-2C/2D/2E/2F was a visible and infrared spin-scan
radiometer (VISSR), whose technical parameters are shown in Table 3.33 (National
Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration 2013b).
(3) FY-4A
FY-4A was launched on December 11, 2016, as the ﬁrst Chinese second-generation
geostationary meteorological satellite. FY-4A is China’s ﬁrst quantitative remote
sensing satellite with a three-axis stabilization structure on a geostationary orbit. Four
new instruments are on board the latest independently developed weather satellite,
namely, an advanced geosynchronous radiation imager (AGRI), a geosynchronous
interferometric infrared sounder (GIIRS), a lightning mapping imager (LMI) and a
space environment package (SEP).
FY-4A is the ﬁrst satellite in China that can capture lightning. The onboard Light-
ning Mapping Imager enables this function. It is the ﬁrst geostationary optical remote
sensing instrument in China and has ﬁlled the gap in terms of lightning observation
and satellite-borne detection. FY-4A can detect lightning over China and neighbor-
ing areas and take 500 lightning pictures per second. By real-time and consecutive
observation of lightning, it can aid in observation and tracking of severe convective
weather and provide early warning for lightning disasters.

Japan’s Satellites
Since Japan launched its ﬁrst geostationary meteorological satellite, GMS-1, in 1977,
it has put ﬁve geostationary meteorological satellites into orbit. The GMS-4 satellite
is positioned at 140°E above the equator and is equipped with visible and infrared
scanning radiometers that observe a fourth of Earth to monitor cloud distribution,
height and dynamics. The satellite can obtain information about winds below and
above clouds, and detect sea surface temperature distribution.
Similar to other GMS satellites, GMS-5 is a spin-stabilized satellite. Its total mass
is 756 kg, the design life is ﬁve years, and the main onboard instrument is a visible and
infrared light spin-scan radiometer (VISSR). The VISSR was signiﬁcantly improved
by building upon the radiometer on board GMS-4. One 6.5–7 µm WV channel was
added to observe water vapor radiation in the middle layer of the troposphere. The
original 10.5–12.5 µm infrared window area was split into a 10.5–11.5 µm channel
and an 11.5–12.5 µm channel to observe radiation from Earth’s surface and the
atmosphere. The nadir spatial resolution of GMS-5 is 1.25 km for the visible light
channel and 5 km for the WV channel. The main parameters of the VISSR on board
GMS-5 is listed in Table 3.34.
After GMS-5 was launched, Japan suspended the development of single-function
meteorological satellite systems. The Japan Meteorological Agency and Japan Civil
Aviation Administration jointly developed a new large, multifunctional, integrated
satellite system called MTSAT. MTSAT-1, the ﬁrst satellite of this system, was sched-
uled to be launched on November 15, 1999. However, the launch was unsuccessful
due a fault with the rocket and both the satellite and rocket were destroyed. Japan
manufactured another MTSAT satellite named MTSAT-1R (Kim et al. 2011). The
satellite was not launched until February 26, 2005 due to the time required to remove
the fault and improve the rocket. The satellite began to broadcast images two to three
months after launch. It was followed by MTSAT-2, which was launched on Decem-
ber 26, 2006 (Fig. 3.29). The MTSAT satellites are equipped with VISSR, cloud

used for meteorological exploration and aviation communication and are the largest

India’s Satellites
INSAT is a multiagent multitarget satellite system and is one of the largest satellite
systemsinAsia.TheINSATsatellitesystemhasplayedanincreasinglyimportantrole
in the Indian aerospace industry with the continuous development and improvement
of the INSAT-1, INSAT-2, and INSAT-3 series of satellites.
INSAT provides services such as domestic long-distance communication, mete-
orological and Earth observation data relay, augmented television receiver national
direct satellite broadcasting, TV education, rural communications, meteorology, and
disaster alarms.
The ﬁrst-generation INSAT satellites, the INSAT-1 series, were manufactured by
FordMotorCo.intheUnitedStatesandcomprisedfoursatellites:INSAT-1A,INSAT-
1B, INSAT-1G, and INSAT-1D. The second-generation INSAT satellites, INSAT-2,
were independently developed by India to meet the needs of the 1990s. The INSAT-
2 series consisted of ﬁve satellites: INSAT-2A, INSAT-2B, INSAT-2C, INSAT-2D,
and INSAT-2E. In addition to normal C-band transponders, the INSAT-2 satellites
also adopted the high-frequency section of the C-band, or the extended C-band. The
third-generation INSAT satellites, INSAT-3, were also made by the Indian Space
Research Organization (IRSO) and comprise ﬁve satellites: INSAT-3A, INSAT-3B,
INSAT-3C, INSAT-3DR, and INSAT-3DS.
INSAT-3A is a multipurpose satellite launched on April 10, 2003 using an Ariane
rocket. The satellite is ﬁxed at 93.50° E and has the following payloads (Fig. 3.30).
Of the twelve C-band transponders, nine provide coverage that extends from the
Middle East to southeast Asia with an EIRP of 38 dBW, and three provide coverage
of India with an EIRP of 36 dBW. The six extended C-band transponders provide

infrared channel (10.5–12.5 µm), and water vapor channel (5.7–7.1 µm) with ground
resolutions of 2 × 2 km, 8 × 8 km, and 8 × 8 km, respectively. The CCD camera
has a ground resolution of 1 × 1 km in the visible (0.63–0.69 µm), near infrared
(0.77–0.86 µm), and SWIR (1.55–1.70 µm) channels.

Russia’s Satellites
(1) Russia’s polar-orbiting meteorological satellites
The “Meteor” series of polar-orbiting meteorological satellites was developed by the
Soviet Union/Russian Federation and has gone through four generations. Most of
the previous three generations of satellites do not function in sun-synchronous orbit.
However, the fourth-generation of satellites is known to work in a sun-synchronous
orbit.
As early as 1962–1969, the Soviet Union had launched more than 20 COS-
MOS satellites for meteorological observation. In March 1969, it launched its ﬁrst-
generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite: Meteor-1. The ﬁrst generation
consisted of 31 satellites (Meteor-1-31) launched from 1969 to 1981, most of which
had an orbital inclination of 81.2°. The second generation (Meteor-2) comprised 24
satellites launched after 1975. In most cases, two or three satellites were simulta-
neously operating on orbit, with an orbital inclination of 82.0° and orbital altitude
of 950 km. The third-generation (Meteor-3) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites
were launched in 1984. The third generation was composed of eight satellites, which
had an orbital inclination of 82° and orbital altitude of 1,200 km.
118
W. Fu et al.
Meteor-3 M N1, the ﬁrst satellite of the fourth generation of Russian meteo-
rological satellites, (the Meteor-3 M series) was launched on December 10, 2001
(Fig. 3.31).
Major changes in the Meteor-3 M series of satellites include: 99.6° orbital inclina-
tion, 1,024 km sun-synchronous orbit, and a broadcast data format that is compatible
with NOAA’s high-resolution picture transmission (HRPT).
(2) Russia’s geostationary orbit meteorological satellites
Russia’s ﬁrst geostationary orbit meteorological satellite (GOMS) was success-
fully launched in November 1994. It is a three-axis stabilized satellite positioned
at 76°E. A problem occurred with the attitude control after launch, but the satellite
resumed working after some remedial measures were taken. Unfortunately, its scan-
ning radiometer’s visible light channel has been unable to acquire any images due to
an optical design error; thus, the satellite can only capture infrared images.
On January 20, 2011, Russia launched the geostationary hydrological and mete-
orological satellite Elektro-L from the Baikonur Launch Center in Kazakhstan
(Fig. 3.32). Fixed at a position 36,000 km above Earth, the satellite is used to mon-
itor climate change in Russia’s Asian region. The visible light and infrared pho-
tographic devices installed on the satellite can capture 1-km and 4-km resolution
ground images, respectively. Under normal circumstances, the satellite takes a photo
once every 30 min. The shooting frequency can be increased to once every 10–15 min
in the event of a natural disaster. The satellite is also responsible for forwarding and
exchanging weather information as well as receiving and forwarding signals from the
international search and rescue satellite COSPAS-SARSAT. GOMS has a life span
of ten years and the data distribution mode is HRPT/LRPT. Its mission is to observe

Earth’s surface and atmosphere, perform solar-geophysical measurement, and sup-
port the data collection system and COSPAS-SARSAT services. The satellite’s main
payload is an optical imaging radiometer, MSU-GS, which provides imaging data in
three VNIR channels and seven infrared channels. Its nadir spatial resolution (sam-
pling distance) is approximately 1 km (for visible light) and 4 km (for VNIR and
infrared), with a new Earth image provided once every 30 min.

Trends in Remote Sensing for Digital Earth
Looking back on the past ﬁve decades of spaceborne remote sensing, every step along
the way has been based on the national backgrounds and political and economic
conditions of each country. During this period of development, the purpose of Earth
observation shifted from single-ﬁeld surveying toward serving the demands of the
overall development of human society (Guo 2014). Since entering the period of
globalization, remote sensing technologies have developed into a complete system
(Guo et al. 2013), which will provide more abundant data for Digital Earth.
Countries and regions with leading Earth observation technologies, such as the
United States and Europe, have formulated Earth observation plans for long-term
development. In 2013, the United States and European organizations were expected
to launch 34 Earth observation satellites, and India and China planned to launch 25
and 26 satellites, respectively. Russia, Japan, and Canada also had plans for over
ten launch missions (Fig. 3.33). Russia will remain a major contributor to satellite
launches in Europe, but European organizations will launch signiﬁcantly more, and
there will be a greater emphasis on cooperation and coordination between European
120
W. Fu et al.
Fig. 3.33 Global launch plans for Earth observation satellites by 2035
countries. In America, the United States will remain a leading force, and Canada will
occupy a secondary role. In Asia, the existing trend will continue, with China, India,
Japan, and South Korea continuing to be major contributors. Currently, no African
countries have plans to launch new satellites.
All of the aforementioned satellite programs have clearly deﬁned services. For
example, the United States’ Earth observation program for 2016–2020 focuses on
measuring global ozone conditions and other relevant gases (GACM program), atmo-
spheric pollution monitoring (3D-Winds), geological disasters (LIST), weather fore-
casts (PATH), and water resource utilization (GRACE-II/SCLP) (Neeck et al. 2008).
The European GMES program covers the six service ﬁelds of land, ocean, emergency
management, security, atmosphere, and climate change (Veefkind et al. 2012). In
addition, Russia, Japan, India, and some other countries have issued strategic plans
for Earth observation, forming systems with their own characteristics. The Russian
Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) intends to form a satellite system consisting of
geostationary meteorological satellites (Elektro series), polar-orbiting meteorologi-
cal satellites (METEOR series), and resource/environment satellites (KANOPUS-V
and Resurs-P series) by 2020. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) pro-
posed the GOSAT program for greenhouse gas monitoring and the GCOM program
for global change monitoring in addition to its ongoing efforts to build the ALOS
program of high spatial resolution satellites carrying L-band SAR and hyperspectral
sensors. Additionally, JAXA has plans to continue with its navigation experiment
satellite program (QZS). The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and the
Indian National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) aim to improve the spatial resolu-
tion of the Resourcesat series and develop SAR-carrying satellites and environment
satellites (Environment Sat) of their own (RISAT series).
In addition, some companies such as DigitalGlobe are planning to deploy new
high-resolution satellites and trying to enter the microsatellite ﬁeld. The planned
satellites have also been extended from optical to meteorological and radar satellites.
However, at present, there are few companies in the commercial satellite market; for
example, DigitalGlobe provides high-resolution optical images, and the European

China is also planning a series of microsatellites for commercial service. Shenzhen-
1 is its ﬁrst microsatellite constellation and will realize 0.5 m resolution with a
revisit period of less than 1 day. Furthermore, the Zhuhai-1, Beijing-1 and Beijing-
2 microsatellites will be launched successively and networked. These commercial
microsatellites aim to provide real time information for Digital Earth.
Future Earth satellite observation programs will focus on program continuity,
development potential, and the capacity for comprehensive and coordinated appli-
cations. Therefore, long-term observation programs will be proposed and the devel-
opment of aircraft-carried and satellite-carried sensors will continue with improved
coordination. Relevant Earth observation programs will emphasize the coordinated
use of Earth observation platforms and data to better meet the requirements of vari-
ous ﬁelds that may beneﬁt from observation efforts, as well as the nuanced strategic
goals of countries and regions (Guo 2018).

Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth
Chuang Shi and Na Wei
Abstract Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have been widely used in
navigation, positioning, and timing. China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System
(BDS) would reach full operational capability with 24 Medium Earth Orbit (MEO),
3 Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO) and 3 Inclined Geosynchronous Satel-
lite Orbit (IGSO) satellites by 2020 and would be an important technology for the
construction of Digital Earth. This chapter overviews the system structure, signals
and service performance of BDS, Global Positioning System (GPS), Navigatsion-
naya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) and Galileo Navigation Satellite System
(Galileo) system. Using a single GNSS, positions with an error of ~ 10 m can be
obtained. To enhance the positioning accuracy, various differential techniques have
been developed, and GNSS augmentation systems have been established. The typ-
ical augmentation systems, e.g., the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS),
the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the global dif-
ferential GPS (GDGPS) system, are introduced in detail. The applications of GNSS
technology and augmentation systems for space-time geodetic datum, high-precision
positioning and location-based services (LBS) are summarized, providing a reference
for GNSS engineers and users.

Introduction
The concept of Digital Earth was proposed by former US vice president Al Gore in
1998. At the 6th International Symposium on Digital Earth in Beijing, Digital Earth
was deﬁned as an integral part of other advanced technologies, including earth obser-
vation, geo-information systems, global positioning systems, communication net-
works, sensor webs, electromagnetic identiﬁers, virtual reality, and grid computa-
tion. Satellite navigation and positioning technology can provide precise position
and time information, which are key elements of the Digital Earth.
In satellite navigation and positioning technology, the radio signals transmitted
by navigation satellites are received by the user terminal. By measuring the time
delay of the signal propagated from the navigation satellite to the receiver, naviga-
tion, positioning and timing services can be realized. Compared with conventional
navigation and positioning techniques, satellite navigation and positioning technol-
ogy can provide precise three-dimensional positions, velocity and time for users. It is
an all-weather, all-time and globally available technology. Great progress has been
made in recent decades, and many countries and consortia have established their
own global navigation satellite systems. Global satellite navigation and positioning
technology has been widely applied in navigation for vehicles, offshore ships, aero
craft and aerospace vehicles and in the ﬁelds of geodesy, oil exploration, precision
agriculture, precise time transfer, and earth and atmospheric sciences.
4.2
Global Navigation Satellite System
Before the advent of man-made satellites, navigation and positioning mainly
depended on ground-based radio navigation systems that were developed during
the Second World War such as LORAN and Decca Navigator, shown in Fig. 4.1. On
October 4th 1957, the former Soviet Union (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
or USSR) launched the ﬁrst man-made satellite. Based on the Doppler shift of the
radio signal, Dr. Guier and Dr. Wiffenbach from Johns Hopkins University success-
fully calculated the orbit of the satellite. This laid the foundation for the scientiﬁc
idea of navigation and positioning with the use of man-made satellites. In 1958,
the US military began to develop the ﬁrst (generation) satellite navigation and posi-
tioning system in the world—the Transit navigation satellite system (TRANSIT),
which was formally put into military use in 1964. The USSR also began to estab-
lish the CICADA system in 1965, and the ﬁrst CICADA satellite was launched in
1967. Using the Doppler shift method, the ﬁrst-generation satellite positioning sys-
tem needed long-term observations to realize navigation and positioning, and the
positioning accuracy was also unsatisfactory. To overcome these limitations, the
joint development of a new generation satellite navigation system—the Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS)—by the US army, navy and air force was formally approved

Fig. 4.1 Overview of the development of satellite navigation systems from the 20th century
by the United States Department of Defense (DoD), opening a new chapter for the
development of satellite navigation systems.
The satellite navigation system was initially designed for military requirements.
With the end of the Cold War, the growing demand for civil and commercial naviga-
tion became increasingly strong. Many countries in the world began to develop inde-
pendent global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), including the GPS developed
by the US, the Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS)
developed by Russia, the Galileo Navigation Satellite System (Galileo) established
by the European Union (EU), and the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS)
developed by China. Since the technical reserve and capital investment required for
the GNSS development is rather large, some countries began to develop regional
navigation satellite systems (RNSS) to meet the navigation and positioning demands
in their own territory and the surrounding areas, for example, the Quasi-Zenith Satel-
lite System (QZSS) of Japan and the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NAVIC)
of India.
GNSSs have evolved from a single GPS constellation to multiple GNSS constella-
tions. In the coming decades, the number of navigation satellites in orbit may increase
to several hundreds. Therefore, the integration of multifrequency and multisystem
GNSS data, compatibility of GNSS signals and interoperability between different
GNSSs are the most important development directions.

Satellite navigation systems consist of three components: the space segment, the
control segment (CS) and the user segment. The space segment comprises a constel-
lation of navigation satellites that continuously broadcast ranging code and naviga-
tion message to users, and receive various information and commands from a ground
monitoring system. The design of the navigation satellite constellation should ensure
that four satellites are visible by any user at any time for positioning. The CS includes
master control stations (MCSs), uplink stations and monitoring stations. The ground
monitoring stations track navigation satellites and the MCSs collect observation data
and calculate satellite orbit and clock errors, which are forecasted and formatted into
navigation messages and uploaded to the navigation satellites through the uplink
stations. The ground CS can also send various commands to the satellites through
uplink stations for satellite orbit maneuver, atomic clock adjustment, fault recovery,
or initiation of spare parts. The geometric distance between the navigation satellite
and the receiver can be measured by the user with a GNSS receiver, and parameters
such as the three-dimensional position, velocity and receiver clock errors can be
obtained according to the satellite’s location in space described by the ephemeris.
As the main functions of these segments are similar for different satellite navigation
systems, we ignore the common details in the following sections and introduce the
unique features of each GNSS.
4.2.1
BDS
BDS, formerly known as COMPASS, is an independent global satellite navigation
system developed and operated by China. As the third mature satellite navigation
system after GPS and GLONASS, BDS provides high-quality positioning, velocity
measurement, timing and short message services for global users. BDS has evolved
from active positioning to passive positioning. A global passive positioning system
will be established by 2020 (http://www.beidou.gov.cn).
Development of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite Demonstration System (BDS-1)
was initiated in 1994. Two geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) satellites were
launched in 2000, and the regional double-satellite positioning system was estab-
lished and put into operation. Based on the active-positioning scheme, positioning,
timing, wide-area differential and short message communication services were pro-
vided for users in China. With the third GEO satellite launch in 2003, the system
performance was further enhanced.
Development of the regional BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS-2) began
in 2004. As a passive-positioning system, BDS-2 can provide positioning, timing,
wide-area differential and short message communication services for users in the
Asia-Paciﬁc region. By the end of 2012, the deployment goal of a regional satellite
navigation system was accomplished, with a constellation of 5 GEO satellites, 5
inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO) satellites and 4 medium earth orbit
(MEO) satellites. On December 27th, 2012, it was ofﬁcially declared that the BDS
could provide regional positioning and navigation services with positioning accuracy
4

of 10 m. China became the third country in the world with an independent satellite
navigation system.
In a third step, the global BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS-3) should be
completed in 2020, with a constellation of 30 satellites (3GEO + 3IGSO + 24MEO).
Both the GEO and IGSO satellites operate in orbits at an altitude of 35,786 km (BDS-
ICD 2013). The inclination of the IGSO orbital plane is 55°. The altitude of the MEO
satellites is 21,528 km, and the inclination is 55°, with a satellite orbit period of 12 h
and 53 min.
BDS-3 has entered into a new era of global deployment with the introduction of
new functions such as intersatellite links, and global search and rescue. The techni-
cal scheme of BDS-3 is fully forward compatible with that of BDS-2 and realizes
performance improvement and service extension. By the end of 2018, the BDS-3
‘basic system’ comprising of 18 MEO and one GEO satellites was completed to
provide services for users in China and neighboring countries along the Belt and
Road. In-orbit validation has shown that the positioning accuracy is 10 m globally
and 5 m in the Asia-Paciﬁc area. By 2020, BDS-3 will be fully completed to provide
global services and an integrated positioning navigation and timing (PNT) system
should be set up by 2035.
The code division multiple access (CDMA) signal system is used by the BDS
and the carrier signal is broadcasted at B1, B2 and B3 frequencies in L band. B1I
and B3I were maintained and inherited from BDS-2, and a new open signal B1C
was added and the B2 signal was also upgraded into the newly designed B2a signal,
which replaces the original B2I signal and greatly improves the signal performance of
BDS-3. The compatibility and interoperability with other GNSSs were also taken into
account. A domestically developed high-precision rubidium and hydrogen atomic
clock with better stability and smaller drift rate was equipped on the BDS-3 satellites,
leading to signiﬁcant improvement in the performance of the onboard time and
frequency standards.
The intersatellite links in the Ka frequency band are equipped for the BDS-3 con-
stellation, and two-way intersatellite precise ranging and communication is realized
through use of phased-array antenna and other intersatellite link equipment. Mutual
ranging and timing through intersatellite links allow for obtaining more measure-
ments from multiple satellites to improve the observation geometry for autonomous
orbit determination. The intersatellite measurement information can also be used
to calculate and correct satellite orbit and clock errors for satellite-satellite-ground
integrated precise orbit determination, improving the accuracy of satellite orbit deter-
mination and time synchronization. Both open and authorized services are provided
by BDS-3. The open service provides free services for global users with a positioning
accuracy of 10 m, velocity measurement accuracy of 0.2 m/s and timing accuracy
of 10 ns. The authorized service provides authorized users with high-precision and
reliable measurement of position, velocity and time, communication services, and
system integrity information.
The basic BDS observations include pseudorange and carrier phase measure-
ments. The pseudorange measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of light
with the transmission time of the GNSS ranging code from the satellite to the receiver,
130
C. Shi and N. Wei
which comes from the correlation operation of the ranging code generated by the
receiver clock with that generated by the satellite clock. The pseudorange reﬂects the
distance between the satellite antenna phase center at the time when the GNSS signal
is transmitted by the satellite and the receiver antenna phase center when the signal
arrives. Its accuracy therefore depends on the code correlation accuracy. Currently,
the noise of the pseudorange measurement is approximately 1%–1‰ of the code
width.
The carrier phase measurement refers to the measurement of the navigation signal
received from the satellite relative to the carrier phase generated by the receiver (the
beat frequency phase) at the time of reception. Once the receiver is powered on,
the fractional part of the beat frequency phase is measured and the changes in the
integer number of carriers are counted. However, the initial integer number of carriers
between the receiver and the satellite cannot be measured. Taking a complete carrier
as one cycle, the unknown number of integer cycles is called the ambiguity. The
initial measurements of the carrier phase include the correct fractional part and an
arbitrary integer number of cycles at the starting epoch. At present, the accuracy of
the carrier phase measurement recorded by electronic devices is better than 1% of
the wavelength; that is, the carrier phase measurement accuracy is millimeter level.
Compared with the other existing GNSSs, the BDS has the following features:
ﬁrst, the space segment of the BDS is a hybrid constellation comprised of satellites
in three kinds of orbits, and the anti-jamming and anti-spooﬁng capability is better
due to more satellites in higher orbits, especially for the low latitude regions; second,
the BDS is the ﬁrst GNSS with signals broadcasted at three frequencies in the full
constellation, which could improve service accuracy with a multifrequency combi-
nation signals; third, navigation and communication are innovatively integrated in
the BDS, so that it can implement ﬁve major functions including providing real-
time navigation and positioning, precise timing and short message communication
services. The service performance of BDS are summarized in Table 4.1.

4.2.2
GPS
The GPS space segment consists of a constellation of 24 satellites, 21 operational
satellites and 3 spare satellites, shown in Fig. 4.2. Four satellites are equally spaced in
each of the six orbital planes with an orbit inclination of 55°. The difference between
the ascending nodes of each orbital plane is 60° and the difference in the argument
of latitude for satellites in the same orbital planes is 30°. This ensures that at least
four GPS satellites can be visible at any time and any location around the world. The
average orbital altitude of the GPS satellites is approximately 20,200 km, and their
orbital period is approximately 11 h 58 min 2 s. For more information about GPS,
please refer to http://www.gps.gov/.
The ﬁrst GPS satellite was launched in 1978, and the constellation of 24 MEO
satellites was completed in 1994. Based on the launch time, the GPS satellites can
be divided into six different types, namely, BLOCK I, BLOCK II/IIA, BLOCK IIR,
BLOCK IIR-M, BLOCK IIF and GPS III satellites. The CDMA modulation is also
adopted for GPS satellites to broadcast carrier signal in the L1 band (1575.42 MHz)
and L2 band (1227.60 MHz). The open civil C/A code is modulated on carrier L1, and
the encrypted P(Y) code for military uses is modulated on carrier L2 (ICD-GPS-200J
2018).
To further expand the GPS civil market and better serve military demands, the
GPS modernization program was promoted by the US government. As shown in
Table 4.2, the modernization of the GPS navigation signal and satellite constellation
includes:
(1) Broadcasting a new civil navigation signal and new military code (M code). The
second civil pseudorange code L2C was introduced on BLOCK IIR-M satel-
lites in 2005, and the third carrier frequency L5 (1176.45 MHz) was added on

BLOCK IIF satellites in 2010. In 2016, the GPS III satellites began to broadcast
three GPS carrier frequencies (L1, L2 and L5) with four civil navigation codes
(C/A, L2C, L5 and L1C), among which the L2C was mainly designed for com-
mercial applications. L5 was developed to meet the demands of navigation users
intheﬁeldofsafety-of-life-relatedtransportationandotherhigh-precisionappli-
cations, and L1C was designed for compatibility and interoperability between
GPS and other GNSSs.
(2) Launching the new generation GPS III satellites to gradually replace the earlier
satellites. The GPS III satellites were no longer able to implement the Selective
Availability (SA) policy and a laser prism reﬂector was carried onboard to
separate the satellite orbit and clock errors. The lifespan of the GPS satellites
was also extended.
Until 2016, the GPS ground control segment consisted of one MCS, one backup
MCS, 15 globally distributed monitoring stations, 11 uplink stations and the auxiliary
communication network, shown in Fig. 4.3. Its MCS was located in Colorado, US.
The ground control segment upgrade was included in the GPS modernization pro-
gram and consisted of the following main aspects: (1) the Legacy Accuracy Improve-
ment Initiative (L-AII) plan completed in 2008; ten GPS monitoring stations that
belonged to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) were added to the
ground monitoring network to improve the forecasting accuracy of the GPS broad-
cast ephemeris; (2) the Architecture Evolution Plan (AEP) for MCS IT upgrade and
the Launch and early orbit, Anomaly resolution, and Disposal Operations (LADO)
plan for monitoring out-of-operation satellites in 2007; and (3) the Next Generation
Operational Control System (OCX) plan implemented in 2010.

control-segment-map.pdf)
The major function of the GPS user segment, including GPS receivers and hand-
held terminals, is to track GPS satellites and compute the three-dimensional posi-
tioning, velocity and time for users. Users can receive two types of GPS positioning
services: standard positioning service (SPS) and precise positioning service (PPS),
shown in Table 4.3. SPS is free for all users. The positioning and timing services
are obtained with C/A code on L1 and the broadcast ephemeris. PPS is aimed at
serving the military and authorized users, and the positioning and timing services
are obtained using the ranging code modulated on both L1 and L2 (Grimes 2007).
4.2.3
GLONASS
GLONASS was developed by the USSR in 1976 and is now operated by Russia.
With the ﬁrst GLONASS satellite launched on October 12, 1982, the full constella-
tion was completed and was put into operation at the beginning of 1996. However,
due to the short satellite lifespan of only 2–3 years on average and the lack of ade-
quate funding to launch supplementary satellites after the economic recession, there
were only six operational GLONASS satellites on orbit in 2011, which severely
impacts the normal use of GLONASS. With the recovery of the Russian economy,
the GLONASS modernization program was initiated. At the end of 2011, the full
24-satellite constellation was restored for independent navigation and positioning
capability.

plane to plane. In each orbit plane, there are 8 satellites separated by 45° in argument
of latitude (ICD-GLONASS 2008). At an altitude of 19,100 km, the orbital period is
11 h 15 min and 44 s. In September 2016, the number of operational satellites in orbit
was increased to 27, 24 of which are GLONASS-M and GLONASS-K1 satellites
with full operational capability. For more information about GLONASS, please refer
to https://www.glonass-iac.ru/.
Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) modulation is used by GLONASS;
thus, different satellites are distinguished by different frequencies. The frequencies
of the civil signals G1 and G2 broadcasted by GLONASS satellites are as follows:
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth
135
 G1 : fK1 = 1602 MHz + 0.5626 MHz × K
G2 : fK2 = 1246 MHz + 0.4375 MHz × K
(4.1)
where K = −7, … 0.6 is the frequency number of each satellite. For any satellite,
f K1/f K2 = 9/7. The frequencies of carriers G1 and G2 for military use are different
than those for civil use. Pseudo-random-noise code is modulated on the carrier signal
and is the same for each set of frequencies. Similar to GPS, the civil code C/A was
initially modulated only on carrier G1 whereas the military code P was modulated
on both carriers G1 and G2. Later, the C/A code was also modulated on carrier G2 of
GLONASS-M satellites. In contrast to GPS, the GLONASS P code is not encrypted.
The original intention to adopt the FDMA system in GLONASS was to enhance
the anti-jamming capability. However, this strategy prevented the promotion of com-
mercialization of GLONASS. To improve the compatibility and interoperability with
other GNSSs, GLONASS began to broadcast the CDMA signal. For example, the
ﬁrst GLONASS-K1 satellite launched in 2011 broadcasted FDMA signals in the G1
and G2 bands and the new CDMA signal in the G3 band (1202.025 MHz), marking
the ﬁrst step of GLONASS signal modernization. In the future, the development
of GLONASS CDMA signals will mainly focus on the G1 and G2 bands. As an
improved version of GLONASS-K1, the GLONASS-K2 satellite could broadcast
civil FDMA ranging code in G1 and G2 as well as the civil CDMA ranging code in
G1, G2 and G3. GLONASS constellation modernization also includes stability and
performance improvement of the onboard atomic clock, satellite lifespan extension,
and introduction of intersatellite laser ranging (shown in Table 4.4).
The GLONASS system control center (SCC) is located in Krasnoznamensk,
Moscow. The GLONASS time reference is maintained by the central clock (CC-
M) in Schelkovo. Five telemetry, tracking and command (TT&C) centers are evenly

distributed in Saint Petersburg, Schelkovo, Yenisseisk, Komsomolsk and Ussuriysk
in Russia. Although the GLONASS TT&C stations are not distributed worldwide, a
high-accuracy broadcast ephemeris can be generated by the ground control segment
because the longitudinal span of the Russian territory is large. In addition, some
TT&C stations are also equipped with a laser station (LS) and other Monitoring
and measuring stations (MS). The service performance of GLONASS system are
summarized in Table 4.5.
4.2.4
Galileo
Galileo was developed in a collaboration between the European Union and the Euro-
pean Space Agency (ESA). Galileo is the ﬁrst global navigation satellite system
designed for civil uses. The space segment of Galileo consists of 24 operational
satellites and 6 spare satellites, which will be positioned on three orbital planes
with an inclination of 56°, and the ascending nodes on the equator are separated by
120°. The orbital altitude is 23,222 km, and the orbital period is approximately 14 h
(ICD-Galileo 2008).
The development of Galileo can be divided into three phases: the development sys-
tem testbed, in-orbit validation (IOV) and full operational capability (FOC). During
the development system testbed phase, two experimental satellites, GIOVE-A and
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth
137
GIOVE-B, were launched in 2005 and 2008, respectively (known as the Galileo In-
Orbit Validation Element, GIOVE). Later, four Galileo-IOV satellites were launched
in 2011 and 2012. In 2014, the Galileo-FOC satellites began to be launched.
The ground control segment of Galileo comprises two parts: the ground mission
segment (GMS)andthegroundcontrol segment (GCS). TheGMSis mainlyresponsi-
ble for processing observations to generate broadcast ephemeris. One ground control
center (GCC) is located in Fucino, Italy, and is mainly responsible for monitoring
the satellite constellation along with the GCC in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. These
two GCCs are responsible for coordination and control of the TT&C stations, sev-
eral uplink stations (ULS) and the Galileo sensor stations (GSSs) distributed world-
wide, to maintain routine operation of the control segment. Galileo attaches great
importance to system augmentation and integrity, which helps ensure the positioning
accuracy and reliability in the ﬁelds of aviation and other safety-of-life applications.
Galileo makes use of the CDMA system to broadcast carrier signals on four
frequencies: E1, E5a, E5b and E6. Five types of services are provided by Galileo
for users: the free open service (OS) similar to GPS SPS, the safety-of-life service
(SoLS), the commercial service (CS), the public regulated service (PRS) and the
search and rescue (SAR) service. Signal E1 supports OS/CS/SoL/PRS services, E6
supports CS/PRS services, E5a supports OS services, and E5b supports OS/CS/SoL
services. The service performance of Galileo system are summarized in Table 4.6.
With the modernization of GPS and GLONASS and the deployment of BDS
and Galileo, the GNSS constellations has developed from approximately 30 GPS

satellites in the early stage to more than 100 GNSS satellites in September 2016,
summarized in Table 4.7. RNSSs such as QZSS and NAVIC are also under develop-
ment. As shown in Fig. 4.4, the global coverage and availability of satellite navigation
system signals have been improved.
In addition, the frequencies and types of GNSS satellite signals are becoming
increasingly abundant (as shown in Table 4.7). For example, the second civil ranging
code L2C and the third frequency L5 have been gradually provided by modern-
ized GPS satellites. In the future, GLONASS will simultaneously broadcast FDMA,
CDMA, as well as the third frequency signal G3. BDS provides signals in three fre-
quencies of the full constellation and Galileo could broadcast carrier signals on four
frequencies and 10 ranging codes. There are over 75 types of measurements (Gurt-
ner and Estey 2013). To meet the ever-growing demand for GNSS civil applications,
the third frequency signals L5 and G3 that are used for safety-of-life applications
were designed by GPS and GLONASS, respectively; as a civil GNSS, Galileo gave
high priority to aviation, safety-of-life and SAR applications at the beginning of its
development.

GNSS Augmentation Systems
As described in Sect. 4.2, the accuracy of GNSS is rather limited and cannot meet the
required positioning accuracy, time latency, reliability and integrity needs of higher-
level users. The GNSS differential positioning technique and GNSS augmentation
system strategy address this issue. In GNSS differential positioning, the observa-
tions of GNSS reference stations are used to model the error sources such as the
ionospheric, tropospheric, satellite orbit and clock errors. These errors are then mit-
igated from the observation of users in real-time or post-processed mode to improve
the accuracy and reliability of positioning. To meet the demands of different users,
several different kinds of GNSS high-accuracy and real-time positioning systems
have gradually been developed, including the wide-area differential augmentation
system, the global/wide-area precise positioning system, the local area differential
augmentation system and the local area precise positioning system (summarized in
Table 4.8).
4.3.1
Wide-Area Differential Augmentation System
In the wide-area differential augmentation system, GNSS satellites are monitored
with a ground tracking network and the raw observations are transferred to the mas-
ter control center through communication links. The master control center models the
errors of the GNSS raw observations and divides the errors into satellite orbit, clock,
and ionospheric errors, which are formatted and broadcasted to users in the service
region through communication links. The positioning accuracy can be improved by

using the wide-area differential corrections. With uniform precision over broad cov-
erage, the positioning accuracy of the wide-area differential augmentation system
is independent of the distance between the user and the reference station. Several
wide-area differential augmentation systems have been established worldwide, e.g.,
the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) of the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion (FAA), the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), the
Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) of Japan, the GPS-Aided
Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) of India and the System Differential and
Correction Monitoring (SDCM) of Russia.
4.3.1.1
WAAS
TheGPSSPScouldnotmeetthehigheraccuracy,integrity,continuityandavailability
demands of users in aviation and other ﬁelds. As a result, the FAA initiated the WAAS
program. As a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) to serve North America,
WAAS is aimed at providing GPS differential correction information through GEO
satellites to augment the GPS SPS. In addition to applications in the ﬁeld of aviation,
the WAAS has also been widely applied to support PNT services.
As illustrated in Fig. 4.5, the WAAS currently consists of 3 wide-area master sta-
tions (WMS), 38 wide-area reference stations (WRS), 4 Ground Uplink Stations and
Fig. 4.5 Diagram of WAAS (source http://www.faa.gov/about/ofﬁce_org/headquarters_ofﬁces/

GEO satellites. The WMS is responsible for calculating the differential corrections
and monitoring the system integrity. The WAAS data processing center receives real-
time GPS observations from the WRS and computes differential correction vectors
using the RTG (Real Time GIPSY) software package developed by the JPL based
on GIPSY-OASIS. The corrections include the satellite orbit error, satellite clock
error and the ionospheric error. Since these differential corrections are expressed
as vectors, the precision of positioning within the areas covered by the wide-area
differential system is equivalent, in contrast to the local-area differential system. The
corrections are uploaded to GEO satellites through uplink stations and broadcast to
users in RTCA format to improve positioning accuracy. The nominal positioning
accuracy of WAAS (with 95% reliability) is better than 7.6 m in the horizontal and
vertical directions. The horizontal and vertical positioning accuracy of WAAS are
better than 1.0 m and 1.5 m, respectively, in most regions adjacent to the US, Canada
and Alaska.
4.3.1.2
EGNOS
EGNOS is a joint program of the European Space Agency (ESA), the EU and the
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The working principle of EGNOS is
similar to that of WAAS. The difference is that EGNOS broadcasts differential cor-
rections and integrity information for GPS as well as the differential corrections
for GLONASS. The EGNOS differential correction information is calculated using
software developed from BAHN, the ESA-owned precise positioning and orbit deter-
mination software, and broadcasted by GEO satellites through the L band. The EU is
considering extending the broadcast coverage from the EU to other regions, including
countries neighboring the EU and Africa.
The EGNOS ground network consists of 39 ranging integrity monitoring stations
(RIMSs), 4 mission control centers (MCCs) and 6 navigation land earth stations
(NLESs). The 4 MCCs are located in Torrejon, Spain, Gatwick, England, Langen,
Germany, and Ciampino, Italy. EGNOS presently provides three types of service:
(1) free open service since October 2009, with positioning accuracy of 1–2 m; (2)
safety-of-life service since March 2011, with positioning accuracy of 1 m; and (3)
data access service since July 2012, with positioning accuracy better than 1 m.
4.3.1.3
MSAS
MSAS was jointly developed by the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) and Japan’s
Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, mainly to provide communication
and navigation services for Japanese aviation users. MSAS covers all ﬂight service
areas of Japan, and can broadcast meteorological information to mobile users in the
Asia-Paciﬁc region. The space segment of MSAS consists of two multifunctional
transport satellites (MTSats), which are second generation Himawari satellites, the
geostationary meteorological and environmental survey satellite developed by Japan.
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth
143
The two MTSats are positioned at 140° E and 145° E. The Ku and L bands are the
two frequencies; the Ku band is mainly used to broadcast high-speed communication
information and meteorological data. Similar to the GPS L1 frequency, the L band
is mainly used for navigation services. The working principle of MSAS is similar as
those of WAAS and EGNOS, and the RTG software authorized by JPL is used for
data processing. From its initial operation in September 2007, MSAS remarkably
improved the navigation service performance for Japanese airports located on remote
islands and met the precision demand for the nonprecision approach speciﬁed by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
4.3.1.4
GAGAN
The GAGAN system was jointly developed by the Indian Space Research Orga-
nization (ISRO) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The space segment of
GAGAN consists of two GEO satellites positioned over the Indian Ocean. Two bands
are applied in GAGAN: the C band is used for TT&C application and the L band
is used to broadcast navigation information. The frequency of the L band is iden-
tical to that of the GPS L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L5 (1176.45 MHz); thus, GAGAN
is compatible and interoperable with GPS. The GAGAN signal covers the whole
Indian continent, providing users with GPS signals and differential corrections to
improve the GPS positioning accuracy and reliability for Indian airports and other
aviation applications. The key technique and core algorithm of GAGAN is also based
on technical support from the JPL. The ground segment of GAGAN consists of a
master station located in Bangalore, an uplink station and eight reference stations
located in Delhi, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Jammu, Port Blair, Guwahati and
Thiruvananthapuram.
4.3.1.5
SDCM
Serving as the GLONASS satellite navigation augmentation system, Russia began
developing the SDCM system in 2002 with an aim of providing differential augmen-
tation information for GLONASS and other GNSSs. The space segment of SDCM
consists of three GEO satellites, also called the Russian civil data relay (Luch/Loutch)
satellites. The three satellites are known as Luch-5A, Luch-5B and Luch-5, located
at 167° E, 16° W and 16° W, respectively.
4.3.2
Global Differential Precise Positioning System
The global differential precise positioning technique was developed from the wide-
area differential GNSS and the precise point positioning technique. In global differ-
ential positioning systems, the GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observations
144
C. Shi and N. Wei
are collected by globally distributed GNSS dual-frequency monitoring stations and
transferred to data processing centers through a real-time data transmission network
to calculate the real-time precise satellite orbit, clock error and ionospheric cor-
rections. Using the corrections, a user could realize decimeter to centimeter level
precise positioning around the world. The wide-area differential augmentation sys-
tem mainly serves navigation users with the pseudorange observations whereas the
global precise positioning system mainly targets positioning users with the carrier
phase observations. Well-known established representative global differential precise
positioning systems include the global differential GPS (GDGPS) system applied for
satellite orbit determination, scientiﬁc research and high-end commercial services,
the StarFire system developed by NavCom, OmniSTAR and SeaStar by Fugro, Cen-
terPoint RTX by Trimble and Veripos by Subsea7.
4.3.2.1
GDGPS
GDGPS is the global precise positioning system developed by the National Aeronau-
tics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States. As shown in Fig. 4.6,
the ground monitoring network of the GDGPS consists of more than 200 real-time
monitoring stations all over the world. These monitoring stations transmit real-time
data to the GDGPS processing center at 1 Hz frequency. Among the tracking stations,
over 75 monitoring stations belong to the JPL. They are evenly distributed worldwide
and equipped with three-frequency receivers. The time latency of the GDGPS from
receiving observations to generating and broadcasting real-time differential correc-
tion products is approximately 5 s. The real-time differential correction products can
be broadcasted in a variety of ways, including through the Internet, a VPN, T1, frame
relay, modem and satellite broadcasting.
Fig. 4.6 The real-time tracking network of the GDGPS (source http://www.gdgps.net/)
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth
145
The JPL-developed RTG software is adopted in the GDGPS, with the state-square
approach proposed by the JPL as its core algorithm. Based on the real-time dual-
frequency GPS observation data collected by GDGPS monitoring stations world-
wide, precise satellite orbit and clock errors are determined and compared with rele-
vant parameters in the GPS broadcast ephemeris to generate differential corrections.
The corrections are broadcasted to users for precise point positioning. The GDGPS
can provide decimeter-level positioning and subnanosecond-level time transfer for
dual-frequency GPS receivers over the globe. Compared with traditional differen-
tial positioning services, the positioning accuracy has been improved by one order
of magnitude. The single-frequency users can also use the global ionospheric TEC
maps provided by the GDGPS to implement ionospheric correction and improve
positioning accuracy.
4.3.2.2
StarFire
Intheearlystage,StarFirewasdesignedtoprovideindependentwide-areadifferential
augmentation services for precision agriculture in North America, South America,
Europe and Australia. The early StarFire system was similar to WAAS and EGNOS,
except that StarFire users must be equipped with high-quality dual-frequency GPS
receivers to eliminate ionospheric delay, and should adopt the wide area correction
transform (WCT) technique that was developed on the basis of NavCom.
In 2001, an agreement was reached between NavCom and NASA/JPL to upgrade
StarFire into a global dual-frequency GPS precise positioning system based on the
RTG technique. Continuous real-time positioning services with subdecimeter accu-
racy can be accessed anywhere and anytime around the world. In addition to the RTG
technique, StarFire can access observation data from the NASA/JPL global monitor-
ing network to augment the StarFire ground monitoring network. In addition, StarFire
makes use of the International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) to broadcast differ-
ential signals to global users through the L band. StarFire users equipped with L
band communication receivers can track and observe GPS satellites and receive the
differential correction signals broadcasted by INMARSAT.
RTG/RTK is a new real-time differential positioning mode recently launched by
NavCom. The disadvantage of a relatively long initialization time in RTG can be
overcome by using RTK. If lock-lose or communication interruption of data links
occur during RTK, real-time positioning services can be continuously provided by the
RTG with centimeter-level positioning accuracy. After restoring the signal tracking
and data link communication in RTK, the positioning result of the RTG can be
used as the initial value for rapid searching and integer ambiguity resolution. The
disadvantage is that at least two RTG/RTK combined dual-frequency receivers are
required on the user side for real-time positioning.
146

4.3.2.3
OminiSTAR/SeaStar
OmniSTAR and SeaStar are real-time global differential systems developed by the
Fugro company. OmniSTAR is mainly used in land and aviation applications and
SeaStar was establishedtomeet thedemands for highkinematicpositioninginmarine
applications. OmniSTAR currently provides four types of differential GPS position-
ing services with different accuracies, VBS, HP, XP and G2, among which the G2
service can support both GPS and GLONASS. OmniSTAR has been widely applied
in agriculture, GIS, aviation, surveying and mapping, asset tracking and monitoring
and, thus, occupies a considerable market share in differential GPS services.
SeaStar primarily serves the offshore oil and gas exploitation industry to meet the
demands for submeter and decimeter-level kinematic positioning with high accuracy
and reliability under special circumstances. It can provide G2, XP2, SGG and stan-
dard L1 services for GPS and GLONASS, as well as XP service for GPS. The latest
G4 service simultaneously supports GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo.
4.3.2.4
CenterPoint RTX
CenterPoint RTX (Real-Time eXtended) is a global real-time differential system
developed by the US company Trimble. It provides worldwide precise positioning
services with a horizontal accuracy better than 4 cm for GPS, GLONASS and QZSS.
Using the corrections broadcasted by the L-band satellite, the initialization time
needed for positioning is less than 5 min.
4.3.2.5
Veripos
Established by the Subsea7 company, Veripos consists of more than 80 reference sta-
tions all over the world. The two control centers of Veripos are located in Aberdeen,
Britain and Singapore. The Veripos Apex, Veripos Apex2, Veripos Ultra and Veri-
pos Ultra2 can provide services with a positioning accuracy better than 10 cm,
and Veripos Standard and Veripos Standard2 can provide a positioning accuracy
better than 1 m. The latest Veripos Apex5 can provide augmentation services for
GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BDS/QZSS with a horizontal positioning accuracy better
than 5 cm (within a 95% conﬁdence level).
4.3.3
Local Area Differential Augmentation System
The local area augmentation system (LAAS) at airports is a typical local area differ-
ential augmentation system. Based on GPS real-time differential corrections, LAAS
was established as an all-weather precision approach and landing system. It con-
sists of reference stations, a central processing station and airborne equipment. GPS
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth

satellites are continuously tracked by several reference stations located around the
airport, and the central processing station receives the GPS observations to generate
pseudorange differential corrections and integrity and precision approach and land-
ing data, which are encoded and broadcasted to the airplane through VHF data links.
Based on the GPS observations, differential corrections and integrity information
broadcasted by LAAS, the airborne equipment can improve the navigation accuracy,
integrity, continuity and availability to realize precision approach category I (CAT
I) along a speciﬁed path. The ultimate goal of an LAAS is to provide CAT II and
CAT III.
4.3.4
Local Area Precise Positioning System
In the local area precise positioning system, several GNSS reference stations are
established in a certain region (district, city or country) and high-accuracy position-
ing service is provided to users within its coverage by taking advantage of differential
corrections through a wired/wireless real-time data communication link. The local
area precise positioning system can be categorized into two operational modes, sin-
gle reference station mode and multiple reference stations mode. In single reference
station mode, a reference station directly broadcasts high-precision carrier phase
measurements to users at the rover station. The rover station receives the measure-
ments and realizes precise positioning based on the differential positioning technique.
The positioning accuracy of single reference station mode is at the centimeter level,
which can meet the demands of applications within a small area.
Thecontinuouslyoperatingreferencestation(CORS)systemisalocalareaprecise
positioning system operated in the multiple reference station mode. CORS consists
of continuously operating GNSS reference stations, which are interconnected by
computer, data communication and the Internet. The observation data (carrier phase
and pseudorange) at CORS reference stations are transmitted to the data processing
center through the communication link in real-time. The data from the reference
networkarethenuniformlyprocessedtocalculateandmodelthereal-timecorrections
for various GNSS errors within the region, such as the satellite orbit/clock error an
ionospheric and tropospheric error. The corresponding observation data and GNSS
error model are broadcasted by the data processing center to users at the rover station
for high-accuracy positioning. Many countries have established their own CORS
systems at the national level, including the US, Germany, England, Australia, Japan,
and Canada. Brief introductions to the US CORS and EPN in Europe are provided
as representative examples.
148
C. Shi and N. Wei
4.3.4.1
US CORS
The establishment of CORS in the US was led by the National Geodetic Survey
(NGS). More than 200 agencies and organizations have been involved in this pro-
gram. The three largest CORS networks include the national CORS network, the
operational CORS network and the California CORS network. In 2015, the US CORS
consisted of more than 2000 reference stations. Most of the stations are distributed in
American. However, several stations are located in Canada, Mexico, Central America
and North America. The US CORS provides users with coordinates under the Inter-
national Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and the 1983 North American Datum
(NAD83), as well as raw observations and satellite orbit products. Real-time differ-
ential positioning service is also available in some areas, e.g., the San Diego real-time
network.
4.3.4.2
EPN in Europe
The EUREF permanent network (EPN) in Europe is a cooperative regional continu-
ously operating network established by the European Commission of the IAG. The
EPN was composed of 250 permanent reference stations in 2016. The workﬂow of
the EPN is as follows: the reference stations are divided into several subnetworks
with independent system operation centers. Several system operation centers con-
stitute a regional data center, and the data from regional data centers are gathered
into the European regional center, which transfers the data products to the IGS data
center, regional data centers and various kinds of users. The EPN provides users with
centimeter-level coordinates and velocity in ITRF and EUREF, as well as zenith tro-
pospheric products for the reference stations. In addition, the EPN can be applied to
monitor crustal deformation, sea level changes, and in numerical weather prediction
(NWP).
GNSS augmentation systems have achieved signiﬁcant developments in the
aspects of the accuracy, integrity, coverage and differential mode. The position-
ing accuracy of GNSS augmentation systems has improved from meter-level, as
for WAAS, EGNOS and MSAS, to real-time decimeter-level and post-processed
centimeter-level, e.g. StarFire and OmniStar. The GNSS augmentation system has
been extended from regional coverage to seamless global coverage. The early GNSS
augmentation systems provided users with correction based on one differential
approach whereas the current system can provide users with high-precision position-
ing with corrections derived from multiple differential approaches. As an effective
supplement to GNSS, the GNSS augmentation systems have greatly improved the
GNSS SPS performance to meet the ever-growing demands for integrity, continuity
and availability of navigation systems. They also beneﬁt many other applications
such as navigation, aviation, maritime, industry, and precision agriculture.

Applications in Digital Earth Case Studies
GNSSs have been widely applied in navigation for vehicles, offshore ships, aero
craft and aerospace vehicles, geodesy, oil exploitation, precision agriculture, precise
time transfer, Earth and atmospheric sciences, and many other ﬁelds. Its applications
in the establishment of space-time geodetic datum, high-precision positioning and
location-based services are introduced below.
4.4.1
Terrestrial Reference System
As a result of inexpensive GNSS receivers, densely distributed tracking stations
and the high accuracy performance, GNSSs have played an important role in the
establishment and maintenance of geodetic datum. The location and movement of a
point on the Earth’s surface must be expressed in a terrestrial reference system (TRS)
attached to the Earth (also called the Earth-centered Earth-ﬁxed system). The origin
of the TRS is usually deﬁned as the center of mass of the Earth, the Z axis is aligned
with the international reference pole, the X axis is coincident with the Greenwich
zero meridian, and the Y axis is orthogonal to the Z and X axes in the right-handed
sense. As an ideal realization of the TRS, the TRF is comprised of a set of stations
distributed on the Earth’s surface with precisely known coordinates. The TRF is of
great importance for geodesy, geophysics and space research. GNSS is an important
data source to establish and maintain the TRF.
The widely used ITRF was established based on space-geodetic observations
including GNSS, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), satellite laser ranging
(SLR), and Doppler orbit determination and radio positioning integrated on satellite
(DORIS). As a realization of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS),
the ITRF can provide datum deﬁnitions (including origin, orientation and scale) for
other global and regional TRS. Since 1988, more than ten versions of the ITRF have
been released by the IERS, the latest version of which is the ITRF2014 released on
January 2016 (Altamimi et al. 2016).
Different TRFs are adopted by different GNSSs. They include the World Geodetic
System 1984 (WGS84) for GPS, Parametry Zemli 1990 (PZ-90) for GLONASS,
Galileo terrestrial reference frame (GTRF) for Galileo and the BeiDou coordinate
system (BDCS) for BDS. Most of the TRFs are aligned to the ITRF. The positioning
results based on GNSS broadcast ephemeris are expressed in the corresponding TRF.
As the TRF for GPS broadcast ephemeris, WGS84 has been reﬁned several times
by the US DoD, resulting in WGS84 (G730), WGS84 (G873), WGS84 (G1150),
WGS84 (G1674) and WGS84 (G1762). PZ-90 is the TRF for GLONASS broadcast
ephemeris.SuccessiveversionsofPZ-90,PZ-90.02andPZ-90.11,havebeenreleased
(Zueva et al 2014). GTRF is the TRF for the Galileo broadcast ephemeris, and
GTRF07v01, GTRF08v01, GTRF09v01 and GTRF14v01 have been released (Gendt
et al. 2011).

To unify the positioning results expressed in different TRFs, a 7-parameter

(4.2)
where T 1, T 2, T 3 are the translation parameters for the X, Y and Z axes, respectively,
D is the scale factor, and α1, α2, α3 denote the Euler angles of rotation for the X, Y
and Z axes. Ri(αi) indicates the rotation matrix constituted by the rotation angles αi
for axis i, which can be expressed as:
R1(α1) =

For the transformation parameters between different ITRF versions, please refer to
Table 4.1 in the IERS Conventions (2010). The transformation parameters between
ITRF2008 and WGS84, PZ-90, and GTRF versions are shown in Table 4.9. The
deﬁnitions of the transformation parameters are the same as in Eq. (4.3).
4.4.2
Time System
Three types of time systems are commonly used. Their time scale are based on the
Earth’s rotation, e.g., the universal time (UT), the revolution of the Earth around the
sun, and the electron transition frequency of atoms, e.g., the International Atomic
Time (TAI). Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) uses the SI second of atomic time
as its fundamental unit and is kept in time with the UT.
Atomic time is a time system based on the electromagnetic oscillation generated
by the atomic transition inside substances. The Standard International (SI) second is
deﬁned as the time that elapses during 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation produced
bythetransitionbetweentwolevelsofthecesium133atom.TheInternationalAtomic

is maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) using the
atomic clocks of 400 national laboratories worldwide.
Universal Time (UT) is deﬁned as the hour angle of mean sun relative to the
Greenwich meridian plus 12 h. UT can be divided into three types. UT0 is directly
determined from astronomical observations. Correcting the Earth’s polar motion
from UT0 yields UT1 whereas UT2 is obtained by correcting the seasonal varia-
tions of the Earth’s rotation from UT1. UT1 deﬁnes the orientation of the average
Greenwich meridian with respect to the mean equinox and thus represents the real
rotation of the Earth. Since UT1 has a tendency of long-term slowdown, the differ-
ence between UT and the atomic time will grow increasingly larger. To avoid such
an inconvenience, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has been adopted since 1972
based on the second length of TAI. It is a uniform but discontinuous time scale, and
the difference between UTC and UT1, which is known as the leap second, is main-
tained within 0.9 s. The leap second with respect to UT1 is released by the IERS,
and the relationship between TAI, UTC and leap seconds can be described as
T AI = UTC + leap
(4.4)
GNSSs are also an important technology to establish and maintain time systems.
The GNSS time system is atomic time, in which the TAI second length is used and
maintained jointly by high-accuracy atomic clocks onboard the GNSS satellites and
implemented in the ground system. With an origin at 00:00 on January 1, 1980, the
GPS Time (GPST) is adopted for GPS system. To ensure uniform continuity, there
is no leap second in GPST and the constant difference between TAI and GPST is
maintained as 19 s.
GLONASS makes use of GLONASS Time (GLONASST), which is synchro-
nized to the UTC (SU) of Russia but biased by 3 h to match the local time zone of
Moscow: GLONASST = UTC (SU) + 3 h. Unlike GPST, there are leap seconds in
GLONASST.
Galileo adopts the Galileo System Time (GST) with an origin at 00:00 on August
22, 1999 (UTC time). The difference between GST and UTC at the starting epoch
is 13 s and there is no leap second to maintain the uniform continuity of GST.
BDS makes use of BeiDou Time (BDT) with an origin at 00:00 on August 22,
1999 (UTC time). The difference between BDT and TAI at the origin moment is 33 s.
BDT is counted with the week number (WN) and seconds of week (SOW). Similar
to GST, no leap second is adopted to maintain uniform continuity of BDT. BDT is
steered to UTC (NTSC).
The transformations between GPST, GLONASST, BDT, GST and UTC are as
follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎩
UTC −G PST
= 19s −leap + C0
UTC −GLON ASST = C1
UCT −BDT
= 33s −leap + C2
UTC −GST
= 19s −leap + C3
(4.5)

where leap is the leap second of UTC with respect to TAI, as shown in Eq. (4.4);
C0, C1, C2, C3 are the daily deviation values of GPST, GLONASST, BDT and GST
relative to UTC, respectively, provided by the BIPM. The accuracies of C0 and C1
are approximately 10 ns and several hundreds of ns, respectively (ftp://ftp2.bipm.
org/pub/tai/other-products/utcgnss/utc-gnss).
High-accuracy UTC time can be obtained through GNSS data. The GNSS
common-view technique has been used by the BIPM for many years as one of its main
techniques for international time transfer. It has the advantages of low equipment
cost, high accuracy and convenient operation. In this technique, the time difference
between two clocks, A and B, is determined by simultaneous observation of a third
clock on a GNSS satellite. Each station observes the time difference between its clock
and the GNSS time plus a propagation delay, which can be largely removed by using
one-way GNSS time transfer procedures. By exchanging data ﬁles and performing
a subtraction, the time difference between the two receiving stations is obtained.
The GNSS timing technique has been widely applied to time and frequency syn-
chronization in the communication, ﬁnance and power industries in China. In the
communication ﬁeld, time synchronization for the whole communication network
is realized through installation of GNSS timing terminals, so the billing time can be
ensured to be consistent and accurate. For the frequency synchronization networks of
China mobile, China telecom and China Unicom, the ﬁrst-level reference clock and
part of the second-level/third-level/micro-synchronization-node clock are equipped
with a built-in GNSS reception module and external GNSS receivers. The time syn-
chronization networks are also equipped with dual-mode GNSS timing receivers.
In the power industry, time and frequency synchronization for the substation net-
work can be provided by GNSS timing. The time systems from power transmission
network to power computer network in the Chinese power industries mainly use
GPS as the master clock for timing and synchronization. On December 1, 2017, the
‘Technical speciﬁcation of time synchronization system and equipment for smart
substation’ (GB/T 33591-2017) became ofﬁcially effective, in which the BDS is
adopted as the main technique for time synchronization. By the end of 2017, there
were nearly 900 sets of dispatching automation master station systems (in 11 cate-
gories) that could receive BDS signals in the domestic power grid control network,
and more than 15,000 sets of GPS timing equipment have been updated to be com-
patible with the BDS.
4.4.3
High-Precision Positioning
The accuracy of single-point positioning based on broadcast ephemeris is only 10 m
and is inﬂuenced by the unmodeled errors and noise of the pseudo-ranges. It cannot
meet the requirements of many applications and limits the use of GNSSs. Differential
GNSS techniques were developed to improve the positioning accuracy to decimeter-
level. DGNSS/RTK and precise point positioning (PPP) are two commonly used
high-precision differential positioning methods. The basic principle uses one or more
154
C. Shi and N. Wei
reference stations with precisely known positions to model the observation errors,
including the ionospheric and tropospheric delay and satellite clock and orbit errors
to improve the accuracy and reliability of positioning for users.
The high-precision GNSS positioning algorithm was developed from the single-
station pseudorange differential approach and carrier phase differential approach into
a real-time carrier phase differential approach based on multiple reference stations
(network RTK), PPP, and PPP with ﬁxed ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR), improv-
ing the resolution accuracy and extending the application modes. The differential
algorithms can be categorized into location differential, pseudorange differential
and carrier phase differential techniques according to the differential observations
adopted. The differential algorithms can also be classiﬁed as single-station differen-
tial, local area differential, wide area differential, or global real-time high-precision
PPP based on the effective range of the differential corrections. They can be catego-
rized into satellite-based and ground-based differential augmentation based on the
type of broadcast link. Finally, the differential algorithms can be categorized into the
state space representation (SSR) differential method and the observation space rep-
resentation (OSR) differential method according to the differential model algorithm
and parameters.
The PPP (SSR) and the network RTK (OSR) are the two major techniques in
high-precision GNSS positioning services. The network RTK method, also known
as the RTK method with multiple reference stations, usually needs more than three
GNSS CORS stations within a certain region. Taking one or several stations as
the reference stations, the distance dependent errors are modeled as regional OSR
corrections. The differential corrections are provided to the rover stations in real time
for precise positioning. The network RTK method can be classiﬁed into four types,
including the virtual reference station (VRS) method, the master auxiliary concept
(MAC) method, the Flächen Korrektur parameter (FKP) method or the combined
bias interpolation (CBI) method, according to the OSR differential corrections used.
The VRS method is the most widely used network RTK technique at present. A
virtualreferencestationisestablishedneartheroverstation.Observationofthevirtual
reference station is generated using the real observation of the surrounding reference
stations plus the regional error corrections. By receiving the observations of the
virtual reference station, users can realize high-accuracy real-time positioning with
the single-station RTK method. In the MAC method, corrections from the reference
network can be divided into two categories: corrections closely correlated with the
carrier frequency, e.g., the ionospheric delay, and corrections independent of the
carrier frequency, e.g., the orbit error, tropospheric error, and multipath effect. The
integerambiguityofthereferencenetworkisinitiallyﬁxedtoensureauniforminteger
ambiguity reference for all the reference stations. The correction difference between
the auxiliary station and the master station is calculated and broadcasted to the rover
station. The principle of the FKP method is to estimate nondifferential parameters
for each reference station in real time and generate the network solution. The spatial
correlation error of the ionosphere and the geometric signal inside the network is
then described with regional parameters. Based on these parameters and locations,
the rover station computes the error corrections and realizes precise positioning.
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth
155
The FKP method has been widely applied in Germany, the Netherlands and other
European countries. The CBI method does not distinguish ionospheric delay from
tropospheric delay and other types of errors when calculating the corrections of the
reference stations. The corrections for each reference station are not broadcasted to
the users. Instead, the observation data of all the reference stations are gathered to
select, calculate and broadcast the comprehensive error corrections to the user.
For speciﬁc regional users, the accuracy of network RTK can achieve centimeter-
level. However, due to the spatial restriction of OSR differential correction methods,
thedistancebetweenreferencestationsinnetworkRTKcangenerallybenomorethan
70 km. Therefore, it would be very costly to establish a wide-area real-time service
system to serve a large number of users using the network RTK method. The PPP
technique based on the wide-area (global) tracking network can realize high-accuracy
positioning with only a few reference stations in a wide area. It could effectively
overcome the disadvantages of network RTK. However, although PPP could provide
positioning service with the same accuracy all over the world, it has the disadvantages
of slightly lower positioning accuracy and relatively longer initialization time than
network RTK.
Based on precise satellite orbit and clock error data, the PPP method could realize
decimeter-leveltomillimeter-levelpositioningaccuracyusingcarrierphaseandpseu-
dorange observations collected by a single GNSS receiver. Only the high-precision
satellite orbit and clock errors are needed to obtain high-precision positioning for
any station at any location and the positioning error is homogenous worldwide. Thus,
PPP has been widely used in crustal deformation monitoring, precise orbit determi-
nation, precise timing, earthquake/tsunami monitoring and warning, and many other
ﬁelds. As an extension of the standard PPP technique, PPP-AR can obtain ambiguity-
ﬁxed coordinates through restoring the integer characteristics of the nondifferential
ambiguity. Its accuracy is equivalent to that of RTK.
In China, the ﬁrst-generation BDS augmentation system was formally approved
on April 28th, 1998, with the goal of providing GPS wide-area differential and
integrity service for users based on BDS-1. It aims to improve the GPS accuracy and
reduce the risk of using GPS. The ﬁrst-generation BDS augmentation system (the
ﬁrst phase of construction) was completed and began trial operation in 2003. During
this period, the augmentation system operated stably and provided real-time GPS dif-
ferential correction and integrity service for various users in the service region. The
positioning accuracy and integrity warning capability were basically in accordance
with the design indicator requirements. In recent years, research and development of
a wide-area real-time precise positioning prototype system in China and the neigh-
boring areas have been carried out with the support of the national 863 program.
As a key project in the ﬁeld of Earth observation and Navigation Technique under
the National High-tech Research and Development Program (863 program) in 2007,
the ‘wide-area and real-time precise positioning technique and prototype system’
was jointly undertaken by the China Satellite Communications Corporation (China
Satcom), China Center for Resources Satellite Data and Application, and Wuhan
156
C. Shi and N. Wei
University. Based on the wide-area differential and PPP technique, the satellite nav-
igation augmentation service is realized with a positioning accuracy of better than
1 m for land, ocean and air transport in China.
The construction of CORS around world has entered into a new era. A provincial-
level CORS system in Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces has been established in
China. CORS systems have also been established in various large- and medium-sized
cities, e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
Wuhan, Kunming, Jinan, Qingdao, Suzhou, Changzhou, Hefei, Dongguan, and Zibo.
There are more than 2200 CORS stations in China. CORS systems may be upgraded
to install BDS receivers. High-precision surveying can be conducted through these
CORS systems with high efﬁciency and less man-power than traditional technology
such as a total station. The CORS system is currently a vital part of surveying and
mapping activities around the world, including urban planning, land surveying and
mapping, cadastral management, urban and rural construction, and mining surveying.
The differential GNSS technique can support cadastral surveying to establish
property boundaries, which is of great importance for ﬁscal policies such as land tax-
ation. In the different construction stages of a building or civil engineering project
(such as a highway, motorway, bridge, underground tunnel, railway, reservoir or
embankment), GNSS positioning can be used to automatically control the construc-
tion equipment. GNSSs are also used to deﬁne speciﬁc location points of interest for
cartographic, environmental and urban planning purposes. GNSSs play an important
role in measurement and calculation at each stage of mine exploitation, including
safety checks. GNSSs are used to monitor critical infrastructure and the natural envi-
ronment to prevent major disasters and promptly intervene in case of emergency.
GNSSs can support a wide range of activities in marine surveying, such as seabed
exploration, tide and current estimation and offshore surveying.
4.4.4
Location-Based Service
Location-based service (LBS) systems work independently or cooperate with mobile
terminals to provide real-time and post-processed positioning and timing service for
various users through different communication networks. LBS relies on GNSS and
augmentation systems to provide uniform space-time datum. Other assisted naviga-
tion and positioning techniques are also incorporated to improve the anti-jamming
capability and availability of LBS. Through communication networks, e.g., the inter-
net and mobile internet, LBS can provide users with positions, attitude, velocity and
time synchronization services.
The workﬂow of a typical LBS system can be designed as follows: the GNSS
wide-area augmentation system receives a real-time data stream from various GNSS
tracking networks, generates the wide-area and regional satellite navigation augmen-
tation signals, and provides them to the authorized public users through broadcasting
systems controlled by a service provider. GNSSs are ‘outdoor’ positioning tech-
niques, as the GNSS signal is affected by strong attenuation and multipath caused
4
Satellite Navigation for Digital Earth

by complex indoor environments. In severe environments, the GNSS signals cannot
be captured. Thus, the location of users inside a building should be determined by
an indoor positioning system using WIFI, Bluetooth, INS, magnetic ﬁelds, and vir-
tual beacons. The information integration platform receives the satellite navigation
augmentation signals and merges them with geographical data to provide users with
comprehensive location-based value-added service through LBS providers. As an
integration of social networks, cloud computing and the mobile internet, LBS could
become the core element of a series of signiﬁcant applications, e.g., intelligent trans-
portation systems (ITS), precise agriculture, intelligence manufacturing and smart
cities. GNSS-enabled LBS applications are mainly supported by smartphones.
ITS refers to efforts to add information and communications technology to trans-
port infrastructure and vehicles in an effort to manage factors that are typically at
odds with each other, such as vehicles, loads, and routes, to improve safety and reduce
vehicle wear, transportation times, and fuel consumption. GNSSs play an important
role in ITS applications such as trafﬁc control and parking guidance by providing
accurate and reliable positioning. The low-cost high-precision GNSS receiver has a
big potential market in ITS. The low-cost GNSS receiver can also be integrated with
an inertial navigation system (INS) to develop an autonomous navigation system
for general aviation (GA). General aviation is the term used to describe all aviation
except government and scheduled-airline use.
The accuracy of GNSS SPS is only approximately 10 m. It cannot tell users the
optimallanetogettotheirdestination,especiallyindenseurbanenvironmentssuchas
multilane roads and highways. With the aid of an LBS system, lane-level navigation
and positioning with meter-level accuracy can be realized. It will become the standard
conﬁguration for passenger vehicles and freight vehicles with hazardous chemicals
in the future. The consortium within the EU-funded InLane project is working on
the fusion between computer vision and GNSS technologies to achieve the required
level of positioning that allows for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (https://
www.gsa.europa.eu/market/market-report).
The embedment of GNSS terminals in bicycle-sharing systems can result in more
accurate and reliable positioning for better user experiences, especially in complex
scenarios. The positioning accuracy can be improved from 50-100 m to approx-
imately 3 m. The GNSS terminals can also support orderly parking. Currently,
approximately half of the bicycle-sharing systems in China are equipped with GPS
terminals. High-precision BDS positioning has also been adopted in driver training.
It can automatically record the trail of the wheel at the centimeter level. Many driving
test centers in China promote this technique.
The premise of precision agriculture is to adapt ﬁeld operations to local varia-
tions in crop and soil conditions using state-of-the-art technology combined with
knowledge-intensive ﬁeld management. The positioning system is a part of precise
equipment that consists of a differential global positioning system (DGPS) receiver,
a radar velocity sensor, a wheel velocity sensor and an electronic compass. Pre-
cision positioning helps complete ﬁeld applications faster and more productively,
accurately, safely and comfortably, with less operator fatigue. GNSS is used in agri-
culture in a few key areas. As crops are harvested, a GNSS receiver connected to
158
C. Shi and N. Wei
a yield monitor sensor records a coordinate along with the yield data. This data is
combined and analyzed to create a map of how well different areas of the ﬁeld are
producing. When spreading fertilizer or planting, equipment operators have tradi-
tionally used markers such as foam or other visual aids to mark where they’ve been
to try to avoid overlap. The assistance of GPS and onboard guidance systems such
as a light bar, can further reduce overlap.
For many years, the leading technology for precision agriculture was GPS L1
receivers providing submeter precision. That precision can meet the requirements of
applications at the submeter level, such as applying chemicals, ﬁeld mapping and
aerial spraying. However, high-precision applications such as auto-steer need cen-
timeter precision. Historically, Hemisphere GPS (formerly CSI), Trimble Naviga-
tion, OmniSTAR, and smaller designers and system integrators have been the GNSS
technology providers for precision agriculture. The world-wide agriculture market
is booming. Auto-steer and other high-precision GNSS applications in agriculture
have contributed to increased production capacity.
The GNSS navigation function in smart phones can record the wheel path and
personal interests as well as the behaviors of pedestrians and drivers, providing large
amount of social activity information. It should be regarded as an important source of
big data on human activities and interests. In the future, with the application of high-
accuracy navigation based on smart phones and the implementation of integrated
indoor and outdoor location services, this big data will provide more abundant infor-
mation. A 2013 Nature paper noted that the owner of a cellphone can be speciﬁed
(with 95% probability) by analyzing the big data of the cellphone location tracks in
a city with approximately 1,500 thousand people. LBS systems could also support
applications such as geomarketing and advertising, fraud management and location-
based billing, which require authentication of the position to protect app users.
LBS applications for healthcare are increasing. Healthcare needs are driving the
diversiﬁcation of wearables. For example, a GNSS-enabled haptic shoe allows for
visually impaired users to set a destination in a smartphone app. The soles guide
the user to the destination by vibrating in the front, back, or sides. Visually-impaired
people or wheelchair users rely on a seamless navigation experience between outdoor
and indoor environments. They need more high-precision horizontal and vertical
position information (https://www.gsa.europa.eu/market/market-report).
In summary, there is a huge navigation and LBS market. The navigation and
LBS network will also promote the development of industries such as national secu-
rity, social security, energy conservation and emission reduction, disaster relief and
mitigation, trafﬁc and transportation, the IoT, resource investigation, and precision
agriculture.

Introduction
Geospatial information (GI), i.e., information including a relationship to the Earth
(Worboys and Duckham 2004), is a foundational ingredient for any Digital Earth
application.Examplesincludeinformationaboutlandparcels,transportnetworksand
administrative boundaries, vehicles, microplastics, ﬁne particles, mobile devices and
people. With GI, we can build digital replicas of our planet and use them to exchange
knowledge, monitor the state of the Earth, simulate possible future scenarios or assess
possible impacts of decision making. Although also other terms (such as ‘geographic’
or ‘spatial’) are used in scientiﬁc and other literature to refer to the same or similar
concepts, we use ‘geospatial’ in this chapter. Furthermore, we speak of ‘information’
as (possibly processed) data in a context that allows for interpretation and meaningful
use.
The technological, semantic, organizational and legal structure that allows for
the discovery, sharing, and use of GI is called geospatial information infrastructure
(GII) (Yang et al. 2010; Granell et al. 2014). With its core functionalities, a GII
can be considered the backbone for Digital Earth. GIIs are essential to facilitate the
information ﬂow that is required to implement any past, present and future version of
the Digital Earth vision—the knowledge sharing platform as initially envisaged by
Gore (1998), a global tool for multidisciplinary research as outlined by Goodchild
and colleagues (2012), or the world laboratory to support codesign, cocreation and
codelivery that was suggested by Schade and Granell (2014).
Emerging from an initially highly technical concept, GIIs have a relatively long
history and are well researched, including their close relationships with geographic
information systems (GIS) (Worboys and Duckham 2004) and spatial data infras-
tructure (SDI) as enabling technologies (Masser 2005; Yang et al. 2010). Promi-
nent examples of these enabling technologies include the spatial data infrastructure
for Australia and New Zealand (ANZLIC 2019), the United States of America-US
National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI 2019), the Infrastructure for Spatial Infor-
mation in the European Community [(INSPIRE 2019), see also Chap. 20], Open-
StreetMap [(OSM 2019a), see also Chap. 18], and Google Maps (Google 2019).
By nature, GIIs undergo a continuous evolution that is primarily driven by the
increasing pace of technological advancements and the inherent digital transfor-
mation of our societies (Castells and Cardoso 2005; Gimpel and Röglinger 2015).
Similar to other information handling tools, GIIs face continuous challenges caused
by the speed of technological progress that sometimes conﬂicts with the heaviness
inhering in most governance structures. For example, the implementation of heavily
governed GIIs bears a risk to continually run behind technological solutions (Schade
and Smits 2012; Tsinaraki and Schade 2016). We have witnessed a shift from pub-
lic sector (alone) to more collaborative approaches to the provision and operation
of GI and related services, which increasingly involve the private sector (smeSpire
2014; Sjoukema et al. 2017). Whereas public sector information (e.g., about cadastral
parcels or protected sites) continues to play an important role, increasing amounts
of spatial data are produced, owned and provided by the private sector. Examples
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
163
include street (navigation) data and satellite imagery, and ‘standard’ products such
as Google Earth, Google Maps, Bing, and spatial data from GPS providers such as
Here and TomTom.
In this situation, we face two opposing forces: traditional standardization pro-
cesses and frequent technological disruption. Heavily standardized large infrastruc-
tures and platforms to support Digital Earth may have been a necessity a few years
ago (Granell et al. 2016), when large amounts of GI were not easily accessible and
data transformation used to be a process that was run on large computing machines
for a long time before harmonized information could be provided to users. During
that time, it was affordable to invest in traditional standard-based infrastructures
and in educational programs that provided specialized training to develop, maintain
and use such infrastructures (Masser 2005; Vandenbroucke and Vancauwenberghe
2016). However, is this still affordable today—in an era of fast digital transformation
when disruptive technologies are about to become a new norm? Or will microservice-
basedarchitectures(Dragonietal.2017)tobuildsmaller,moremanageableplatforms
beat monolithic, big, layered architectures? How must the development of standards
change to ﬁt these new dynamics? What roles will the private sector play in this new
set-up?
The question of whether Digital Earth will follow the traditional standardization
approach, an alternative approach that completely embraces vivid digital transforma-
tion or anything in between has strong implications on the deﬁnition of the conceptual
architecture of the GII with Digital Earth. Hence, we are at a controversial point in
GII and Digital Earth history. This chapter outlines how we arrived at this point,
explains the current situation in more detail, provides a critical reﬂection, and out-
lines a few future trajectories. We hope that this contribution to the Manual of Digital
Earth aids in understanding the importance and evolution of GIIs and provides food
for thought for those that will develop and use GIIs to implement the Digital Earth
vision.
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. The next section introduces
the history of GIIs during the different phases of organizational and technological
development (Sect. 5.2). Next, we outline the current situation in respect to GII
development, education and use (Sect. 5.3). We focus on the evolving relationship
between GIIs and Digital Earth and important recent movements such as Open Sci-
ence. In Sect. 5.4, we discuss changes and the challenges that GIIs face today. The
most important implications for the Digital Earth vision are highlighted. In Sect. 5.5,
we close the chapter with a brief conclusion and an outlook on the future of GIIs in
support of Digital Earth. For details about GI analysis and processing, we refer the
reader to Chap. 6. Matters of GI visualization are discussed in Chap. 7.

A Brief History of Geospatial Information
Infrastructures
GIIs are not a new concept, and have evolved over a series of generations, each char-
acterized by changing purposes, available technologies, and the main stakeholders
involved in their design, implementation and use. Instead of describing these gener-
ations in detail, which has been done elsewhere (Rajabifard et al. 2002; Yang et al.
2010), we highlight fundamental milestones in the history of GII. We also highlight
evolutions of the technical architectures used to implement GIIs over the past few
decades.
5.2.1
Geospatial Information Infrastructure Milestones
In the history of GIIs worldwide, a series of milestones have been essential for the
evolution of GIIs into their current form—most of which relate to actions of govern-
ment, i.e., policy updates. Notably, these milestones differ in nature, for example,
by administrative dimension, research purpose or geographic extent. However, they
give a sensible impression of aspects that have framed the evolution of GIIs up to
today.
As a ﬁrst milestone, the EU initiated the CORINE program in 1985 with the aim of
describing the status of the environment in Europe. This program was the ﬁrst large-
scale effort in Europe to collect spatial data covering the European territory according
to agreed speciﬁcations in view of supporting different policies. It delivered its ﬁrst
pan-European land cover data set in 1990, with updates in 2000, 2006 and 2012.
The second milestone dates back more than thirty years to the establishment of the
Australian Land Information Council (ALIC) in January 1986. ALIC was the result
of an agreement between the Australian Prime Minister and the heads of the state
governments to coordinate the collection and transfer of land-related information
between the different levels of government and to promote the use of that information
in decision making (ANZLIC 1992). One year later, a third milestone occurred in
May 1987 with the publication of the Report of the British Government Committee
of Enquiry on Handling Geographic Information chaired by Lord Chorley (Coppock
1987). This report, also known as the Chorley report, set the scene for much of
the subsequent discussion about GIIs in the UK and in other parts of the world.
While the report reﬂected the committee’s enthusiasm for the new technology: “the
biggest step forward in the handling of geographic information since the invention
of the map” (para 1.7), it also expressed their concern that information technology
must be regarded as “a necessary, though not sufﬁcient condition for the take up of
geographic information systems to increase rapidly” (para 1.22). A fourth important
milestone in the late 1980s was the release of the ﬁrst issue of the International
Journal of Geographic Information Systems, also in 1987. The journal, renamed
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
165
the International Journal of Geographic Information Science in 1997, was the ﬁrst
scholarly journal devoted to GI.
The ﬁfth milestone occurred in 1990 when the United States Ofﬁce of Manage-
ment and Budget (OMB) established an interagency Federal Geographic Data Com-
mittee (FGDC) to coordinate the “development, use, sharing, and dissemination of
surveying, mapping, and related spatial data.” The main objectives of a national
GII were “encouraging the development and implementation of standards, exchange
formats, speciﬁcations, procedures, and guidelines, promoting technology develop-
ment, transfer, and exchange; and promoting interaction with other existing Federal
coordinating mechanisms that have an interest in the generation, collection, use and
transfer of spatial data…” (OMB 1990, pp. 6–7). These ideas were subsequently
developed and extended by the United States National Research Council’s Mapping
Science Committee in their report ‘Toward a coordinated spatial data infrastructure
for the nation’ (National Research Council et al. 1993). This report, which can be
seen as a sixth milestone in the history of GIIs, recommended that effective national
policies, strategies, and organizational structures be established at the federal level
for integration of national geospatial data collection, use and distribution. A sev-
enth milestone is the outcome of an enquiry by the Directorate-General XIII (now
DG Connect) of the European Commission (EC), which found that there was a
strong Europe-wide demand for an organization that would further the interests of
the European GI community. As a result, the ﬁrst regional level multidisciplinary SDI
organization in the world was set up in 1993. The vision of the European Umbrella
Organisation for Geographic Information (EUROGI) was not to “replace existing
organisations but catalyse effective cooperation between existing national, interna-
tional, and discipline-oriented bodies to bring added value in the areas of Strategy,
Coordination, and Services” (Burrough et al. 1993).
An eighth milestone that marks a turning point in the evolution of the SDI concept
came in the following year with the publication of Executive Order 12906 signed
by President Bill Clinton, entitled “Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and
Access: the National Spatial Data Infrastructure” (Executive Ofﬁce of the President
1994). This described the main tasks to be carried out and deﬁned time limits for
each of the initial stages of the national spatial data infrastructure. These included
the establishment of a national geospatial data clearing house and the creation of
a national digital geospatial data framework. (Here, we understand data clearing
houses as “internet-based components that intend to facilitate access to spatial data,
by establishing a centralized site from which data from several sources can be found,
and by providing complementary services, including searching, viewing, transfer-
ring, and ordering spatial data” (Davis 2009). The Executive Order gave the FGDC
the task of coordinating the Federal government’s development of the National Spa-
tial Data Infrastructure. As the Executive Order also required each member agency
of that committee to hold a policy-level position in their organization, it signiﬁ-
cantly raised the political visibility of geospatial data collection, management and
use among US institutions and internationally. The organization of the ﬁrst Global
Spatial Data Infrastructure (GSDI) Conference in Bonn, Germany, in September
1996 was another—ninth—milestone in the 90s. The conference brought together
166
S. Schade et al.
representatives from the public and private sectors and academia for the ﬁrst time
to discuss matters relating to NSDIs at the global level. Shortly after, in 1998, the
Baveno Manifesto set a fundamental milestone for European space policy. It led
to the establishment of the Global Monitoring for Environmental Security (GMES)
program, which was formally established in 2010 (Regulation (EU) No 911/2010),
and followed by the Copernicus program in 2014 (Regulation (EU) No 377/2014).
After 2000, the evolution of GIIs worldwide continued, and several milestones
can be highlighted. One was the establishment of the intergovernmental Group on
Earth Observations in February 2005 to implement a global Earth observation system
of systems (GEOSS) to integrate observing systems and share data by connecting
existing infrastructures using common standards. In 2018, there were more than 400
million open data resources in GEOSS from more than 150 national and regional
providers such as NASA and ESA, international organizations such as the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) and commercial sector groups such as Digital
Globe (Nativi et al. 2013). Another—eleventh—milestone was the launch of the ﬁrst
scholarly journal in the GII ﬁeld in 2006. The International Journal of SDI Research is
a peer-reviewed journal that is operated by the Joint Research Centre of the European
Commission, which aims to further the scientiﬁc endeavor underpinning the develop-
ment, implementation and use of Spatial Data Infrastructures. Directive 2007/2/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 established an
Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE, see
Chap. 20 for more details) can be seen as a twelfth milestone in the evolution of GIIs.
The INSPIRE Directive aimed to establish a spatial data infrastructure to improve the
sharing and interoperability of geospatial data in support of environmental policies
and policies that might have an impact on the environment (Directive 2007/2/EC of
the European Parliament and the EU Council) and was the second multinational GII
initiative that sought to make harmonized high-quality GI readily available. INSPIRE
stresses the principles of data sharing and cross-border usage of the data. The year
2011 marked a key event that initiated the deep involvement of the private sector: the
ﬁrst Geospatial World Forum “Technology for people and Earth” (Geospatial World
2011). This global conference gathers diverse stakeholders to present and discuss the
pathways of the geospatial industry. In addition, the United Nations Committee of
ExpertsonGlobalGeospatialInformationManagement(UN-GGIM)wasestablished
in July 2011 (ECOSOC Resolution 2011/24) as the ofﬁcial United Nations consul-
tative mechanism on global GI management. Its primary objectives are to provide a
forum for coordination and dialogue among Member States of the United Nations
(UN) and between member states and relevant international organizations and to
propose work plans that promote global frameworks, common principles, policies,
guidelines and standards for the interoperability and interchangeability of geospatial
data and services. Not long ago, (23 June 2015) the ﬁrst Sentinel (satellite developed
for the Copernicus program delivering open Earth Observation) was launched. This
milestone initiated the launch of a set of sister satellites that deliver high-resolution
images and contribute strongly to a new era of GI provision worldwide.

Table 5.1 provides an overview of the ﬁfteen milestones discussed in this section.
They are mostly institutional, legal and policy-related. Notably, the milestones cover
different regions (e.g., Europe, North America and Australia), administrative levels
(e.g., national, regional and global) and sectors (e.g., academic and cross-sectoral
initiatives). They reﬂect the breadth and diversity of GII initiatives since the 1980s.
This demonstrates how GIIs took a leading role in promoting and enabling open data
publishing, possibly as the most common theme across the globe. These develop-
ments took place in support of the Open Movement, Open Science, Open GIScience,
and citizen science, which we explore in more detail later in this chapter (in Sect. 5.3).

Architectural Evolutions in Geospatial Information
Infrastructure Development
Alongside these milestones, we have witnessed an evolution of GII architectures and
technological solutions, following the increased sophistication of technology and
growth in user requirements. We summarize the central developments, concentrating
primarily on GII. Another chapter of this manual addresses the irruption of sensors,
sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT, see also Chap. 11). For developments
and implications of machine learning, deep learning, and artiﬁcial intelligence, we
refer the interested reader to Chap. 10.
GI has been used for many decades in different application ﬁelds (Longley et al.
2011). In the eighties, GIS technology started to spread globally. Prior to the develop-
ment of SDIs, which only expanded at a broader scale in the nineties, geospatial data
assets were created, managed and used by individual organizations using standalone
GIS. In 1987, Specialized software companies such as ESRI brought GIS software
to the market that could run on personal computers. Others, such as Intergraph, did
the same, and academic and even public sector parties developed software for using
geospatial data for particular purposes. Examples include ILWIS (2019) and GRASS
(2019).
However, in this period, most efforts were focused on the collection and main-
tenance of data, as well as its use within the organization. Big data collection
efforts started taking place. For example, in Europe the need for data that are stan-
dardized, well-documented, high-quality and available for the broader community
became apparent. Therefore, the Coordination of Information on the Environment—
CORINE program was initiated by the EU. This and similar initiatives elsewhere in
the world, e.g., in the US through the FGDC, revealed the need to work more system-
atically in several technical aspects: documentation (metadata), data harmonization,
access mechanisms and standards (Nebert 2004). These technological developments
occurred in parallel with the organizational and institutional developments described
in the previous section.
Originally, the focus was on exchange formats and particularly on the transfor-
mation—where required—from one format to another. In practice, for a long time de
facto standards were used a lot. One good example is the shapeﬁle format developed
by ESRI that was (and still is) used to transfer geospatial data from one organization to
theother(ESRI1998).Inthenineties,dataexchangebetweenorganizations,although
often on an ad hoc basis, became more and more important to avoid duplication of
data sets and to share resources more efﬁciently. With this increased exchange, good
documentation became paramount (Danko 2005). From the early nineties, organi-
zations explored ways of documenting data in a standard manner. The ﬁrst standard
used by many was the FGDC metadata standard, which was initiated by President
Clinton by executive order 12906 (1994) and became ofﬁcial in 1998 (FGDC 1998).
This standard was used a lot, even in Europe. Work on an international metadata
standard also began in the nineties but saw only light in 2003 with the adoption
and publication of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
169
19115 in 2003 (ISO 2003). Since then, thousands of organizations have documented
their geospatial data sets according to this standard.
To make potential interested parties aware of the existence of geospatial data
resources, the publish-ﬁnd-bind paradigm was deﬁned as a key concept for SDIs
(van Oosterom 2005). The idea is to ‘publish’ geospatial data resources by docu-
menting and putting them in a catalogue, then make them ‘discoverable’ by a search
mechanism and ‘accessible’ through a binding mechanism, which means that they
can be integrated in a user application (e.g., a web-viewer, a desktop GIS or other
application). In addition to the metadata, access mechanisms were designed and
developed and became a key component of the technical parts of an SDI (Zhao
and Di 2011). The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which was established in
1994, brought together different academic, private and public sector parties and soon
focused on the standardization of interfaces for accessing geospatial data resources
(OGC 2019). They developed several web service interfaces to perform basic jobs
such as ‘discovery’ (CSW—Catalogue Services for the Web), ‘viewing’ (WMS—
Web Mapping Services—a ﬁrst version of the standard was released in 2000), and
‘downloading’ (WFS—Web Feature Services). These OGC standards were meant
to adhere to Service-Oriented architecture (SOA), an architectural style aimed at
designing applications based on a collection of best practices, principles, interfaces,
and patterns related to the central concept of a service (Papazoglou and van den
Heuvel 2007). In SOA, services are the basic computing unit to support develop-
ment and composition of larger, more complex services, which can be used to create
ﬂexible, ad hoc, dynamic applications. The main design principle behind SOA is that
a service is a standards-based, loosely coupled unit composed of a service interface
and a service implementation. Previous examples of OGC service speciﬁcations were
designed to comply with these SOA principles to publish, ﬁnd and use geospatial
data. Most of the commercial software companies, as well as the Free and Open
Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) community—with a major push in 2006
with the establishment of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)—devel-
oped tools and platforms to create such services and build portals for users to ﬁnd
and access data (Tait 2005; Maguire and Longley 2005).
In addition to the efforts to document GI and make it more discoverable and
accessible, many efforts were made to better harmonize them for use in cross-border
and cross-sector settings. The ISO Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC211) was cre-
ated in 1994 to look into the standards for Geographic Information and Geomatics.
There was a large effort to develop the so-called ISO 19100 series of standards
that, in addition to the already mentioned metadata standard, comprise a series of
standards describing how to model our world (ISO 2002). The series includes a ref-
erence model, the deﬁnition of spatial and temporal schema, rules for application
schema, and a methodology for cataloguing spatial features. In 2001, preparations
began to design and implement INSPIRE, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information
in Europe (INSPIRE 2019). In addition to the key idea of improving GI sharing (pol-
icy challenge), another objective was to improve spatial data interoperability through
the design of data speciﬁcations for 34 themes (technical and organizational chal-
lenges). The ISO 19100 series of standards served as a basis for this huge effort. The
170
S. Schade et al.
resulting portfolio of standardized data sets serves cross-border applications in the
context of environmental policy making/monitoring and other sectors. The process
of harmonization is still ongoing at the time of writing.
In parallel with these more formal developments, stimulated by the public sector,
developments in the private sector soon inﬂuenced SDIs and were ultimately (at least
partially) integrated. In 1998, US Vice President Al Gore coined the term Digital
Earth in view of global challenges such as climate change (Gore 1998). In 2001, a
small software company called Keyhole Inc. launched and developed the Keyhole
Earth viewer for looking at our globe from a global, bird’s-eye view. The technical
solution, aimed primarily at the defense sector, looked at geospatial data from a 3D
perspective. A few years later, in 2004, Google acquired the small company and
launched the still very popular product Google Earth based on the KML standard.
More SDI developments embraced these new developments and aimed to integrate
data from these commercial products into SDIs and applications. This whole process
ended with the adoption of KML (originally keyhole markup language) by the OGC
as a community standard.
In support of the development of SDIs, speciﬁc software developments emerged.
Traditional GIS desktop software such as ArcGIS from ESRI was extended with
server and mobile software, and the FOSS4G communities developed speciﬁc prod-
ucts that became very popular, such as GeoNetwork (to create geoportals and cata-
logue services), GeoServer, Degree and others (to set up all kinds of web services),
and open source systems for data management such as POSTGIS (Steiniger and
Bocher 2009; Brovelli et al. 2017). In addition to open standards and open software,
open data became a new paradigm with important initiatives that are still very pop-
ular. In 2004, there was a global effort from the geospatial community to develop
and maintain a network of streets (OSM), which was a joint effort of thousands of
volunteers to provide and include data into an open data product (Haklay and Weber
2008). These volunteered geographic information (VGI) efforts became also part of
the maintenance procedures of commercial products such as those from TomTom
(formerly Tele Atlas) and Here (formerly NavTeq). The idea of citizens contribut-
ing to data and information gathering has now become widespread and is termed
crowdsourcing [(Capineri et al. 2016), see also Chap. 18 for more details]. From the
SDI perspective, which often focuses on authoritative data coming from government,
these initiatives and the resulting geospatial data resources are considered comple-
mentary. The concept of GIS-based (open) data portals for smart city projects has
also taken hold in recent years (ESRI 2019a).
These developments (see Table 5.2) led to a vibrant geospatial community and
many GIIs that are interconnected (Vandenbroucke et al. 2009) and rich in content
and quality, and new developments started to inﬂuence the way of working and the
methods of providing data to user communities. Although the geospatial world has
always worked somewhat in isolation, the developments in the general ICT world led
to increased interest in joining forces. In 2006, Tim Berners-Lee coined the concept
of Linked Data to combine the huge amounts of data available on the web (Berners-
Lee 2006). In the geospatial world, this led to the idea of the geosemantic web. In
2014, the OGC and W3C started several joint initiatives including the Spatial Data

on Web Working Group to examine and test new ways of publishing and linking data
(W3C 2015). One of the tangible results of this closer collaboration was the effort
to exchange metadata between geoportals and (open) data portals through a more
generic and broadly used DCAT standard (W3C 2014). More of these developments
are expected to take place—and will continue to emerge faster and faster. This poses
particular challenges to standardization processes, which should keep pace with
these evolutions. In the next sections, we describe ongoing and new developments,
for example, the changing power relationship from the public to the private sector
and challenges posed by the trending platformization of society (van Dijck et al.
2018).
5.3
Geospatial Information Infrastructures Today
Leaving the past behind, several important developments and aspects of the current
situation of GIIs are important to mention. We consider the following items worth
highlighting in the context of Digital Earth: the mainstreaming of GI and the prolif-
eration of GIIs, especially on the web; the contribution of GII developments to the
opening of data and science as a whole; and the growth of knowledge exchange and
learning networks across the globe.
5.3.1
The Evolution of Geospatial Information on the Web
In parallel to the organizational milestones described in Sect. 5.2, the technical foun-
dations of GIIs were developed and standardized, mostly through bodies such as the
OGC and ISO (see Sect. 5.2.2). Along with this development, the proliferation of
slippy web maps and map-based mobile applications has led to the establishment of
a separate branch of GII that primarily addresses end-user needs by, for example,
providing directions to get from one place to another or offering extensive geocoding
capabilities (“where is the closest coffee shop?”). The widespread adoption of these
new services that were no longer just providing GI for a group of professional users
was driven by the introduction of Google Maps in 2005 as well as the introduction
of touch-screen smart phones with built-in GPS through the ﬁrst iPhone in 2007.
Shortly after the introduction of Google Maps, the ﬁrst reverse-engineered map
mashups appeared and demonstrated how Google’s JavaScript-based maps could be
combined with GIs from other sources (such as crime data on ChicagoCrime.org
or real estate offerings on housingmaps.com). The subsequent release of a public
Application Programming Interface (API) for Google Maps that allowed for any
web developer to embed a map in their web pages triggered the development of open
source alternatives such as OpenLayers (OpenLayers 2019), which is still under
active development today as an OSGeo project. OpenLayers is notable in this con-
text because it bridges the worlds of consumer-oriented GI and GIIs targeted at
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
173
professional use cases by allowing the combination of data from OGC-based web
services with tiles and ﬁle formats such as KML. Esri released its JavaScript API
to facilitate the creation of web apps from traditional GIS datasets (ESRI 2019b).
Together with other, more recent examples such as Leaﬂet (Leaﬂet 2019), a ‘grass-
roots’ standard emerged for the URL scheme of map tiles for slippy maps (OSM
2019b). This URL scheme enabled any web mapping framework to consume and
display the tiles from any of the increasing number of servers that can produce them
(GeoServer, MapServer and TileStache are a few examples)—a de facto standard-
ization process that was successfully completed without the involvement of any of
the abovementioned standardization bodies.
A third aspect that explains today’s GII landscape is the development and
widespread adoption of open data (Open Data Barometer 2015; Gurstein 2011;
Kitchin 2014). This includes thematic open data sets available for direct download
via web portals (ESRI 2019c) and the free provisioning of governmental data, which
was previously made available for a (sometimes substantial) fee—if at all. The prolif-
eration of open government data (OGD) has been complemented by the development
of user-generated data sources, dubbed volunteered geographic information (VGI,
Goodchild 2007) in the context of GI. OGD aims to make data originally produced
for professional users available to a broader public, and VGI can be seen as a grass-
roots movement producing its own collection of non-authoritative datasets. The VGI
project with the most profound impact is OSM. OSM started as a free, bottom-up
alternative to the then-prohibitively expensive data produced by the UK’s Ordnance
Survey, and has since become the largest collection of freely available GI. At the
time of writing of this chapter, the OSM database consisted of close to 5 billion
mapped nodes (points), collected by almost 5 million registered users (OSM 2019c).
Its signiﬁcance for development in the ﬁeld today lies in the provisioning of a free,
global, and in many areas extremely detailed collection of GI and in the number of
innovative companies that have entered the market with products based on OSM.
They continuously contribute to the OSM dataset and have developed open source
tools around it for mapping, quality checking, and the use and processing of OSM
data.
A notable recent development that emerged from this OSM ecosystem is the trend
towards using vector tiles instead of prerendered image tiles. The improved support
for rendering vector data in modern web browsers has enabled this switch. Vector tiles
have several advantages over image tiles, such as adaptable styling, maps that look
sharp independent of screen resolution, and opportunities for interaction with the
actual individual map features (interactive labels or clickable features, for example),
with smaller data volumes to transfer between the server and client.
As these examples show, the collection, distribution, and analysis of GI has
evolved from a ﬁeld that used to require expensive equipment and extensive pro-
fessional training to activities that are carried out by users (and contributors) with
highly diverse backgrounds and different levels of education. The ubiquity of devices
capable of both producing and consuming GI, in combination with an ever-growing
amount of free-to-use GI and powerful free and open source software solutions has
led to a somewhat chaotic landscape of practices, standards and conventions for the
174
S. Schade et al.
data and processes involved. The involvement of a broader public in these processes
also means that organizations such as OGC or ISO that primarily focus on the pro-
fessional use of GI are addressing a decreasing share of the actual GI user base. An
increasing number of users and producers of GI do not work for government agen-
cies, conduct commercial mapping efforts, or develop software for GI web services.
Instead, they may be working in data science or data visualization (Bostock et al.
2011), may be open data advocates or citizen scientists, or may do research in areas
such as economics, ecology, or the humanities.
New companies that deal with GI at the core of their business that do not consider
themselves GIS companies have established new ways of dealing with GI, without
taking the time to go through time-consuming standardization processes. The long
list of prominent examples of these companies includes Mapbox, Carto, Uber, book-
ing.com, Trip Advisor, Google and Facebook. Many of the relatively new internet
platforms contain GI and thereby initiated a shift to the traditional organizational
structures (van Dijck et al. 2018).
Arguably, with this industrial production and use of GI, large companies set the
de facto standards—as far as standards are relevant for their internal workings. To
some extent, these developments have been acknowledged by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) in some efforts that have traditionally been exclusive to the OGC,
most notably the Spatial Data on the Web Working (W3C 2015) and Interest Groups
(W3C 2017) and the best practices documents produced in this context (W3C 2019).
The formation of these groups leverages the opportunity to involve a much broader
group of users in the discussion around how GI should be shared on the web, and
their discussions and outputs clearly show that the integration of GI from different
sources is a semantic issue at its core (Kuhn 2005). This semantic interoperability
and its role for the future of GII in the context of Digital Earth is discussed in detail
in Sect. 5.4.2. The following section describes how GII is a prime example of the
openness that has become the new normal in many ﬁelds of science, technology, and
business.
5.3.2
Geospatial Information Infrastructures Champion
Openness
As presented earlier, today’s GII landscape is shaped by the inﬂuence, development
and widespread adoption of open data (see also above). The notion of ‘openness’
has long been part of GIIs, especially due to the long-term leading role of the pub-
lic sector (Schade et al. 2015). A foundational role of GIIs has been, and still is,
to enable the discovery and sharing of spatially referenced data. As described in
Sect. 5.2, SDIs were essentially designed and developed to support the generation,
management and processing of GI, as key vehicles to make data openly accessible
to a broader community. However, as a social construction, the understanding and
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
175
interpretation of openness is far from static; it is dynamic and changes as the tan-
dem technology-society evolves. Thus, the interpretation of ‘open’ (data, tools, etc.)
reﬂects the changes in society and necessarily adapts to the new uses and needs of
people. In addition, the value of open data is under scrutiny (Craglia and Shanley
2015) and an increasing number of commercial companies produce and host GI.
To better understand how the current discussion about openness affects GIIs and
to better speculate future scenarios, we provide two brief stories, paraphrasing the
way Arribas-Bel and Reades (2018) examine the evolution between geography and
computers. First, we take a brief historical perspective to determine what openness
meant in the origins of (governmental) GIIs. Next, we look at the new ‘open’ trends
and growing forces that are currently emerging, mostly outside of GIIs, which we
argue are important for GIIs (and Digital Earth) to pay close attention to. Both stories
allow for us to reﬂect and speculate on the need for a convergent point in the future,
where GIIs can embrace and continuously adapt to evolving notions of openness and
to the resulting societal changes and economic implications.
The ﬁrst story goes back to the reasons that motivated the need to establish
GIIs. Since the outset, GIIs in the form of hierarchical visions on SDI (Rajabi-
fard et al. 2003) or networked visions (Tulloch and Harvey 2008; Vandenbroucke
et al. 2009) contained relatively restricted themes and types of resources owned by
the public sector. The underlying motto was “collected once, shared multiple times”,
so each GII node was managed homogeneously its own spatially referenced data.
Data sharing was feasible through these infrastructure nodes because data discovery,
access, and delivery were affordable through well-known standardization practices
(see Sects. 5.2.2 and 5.3.1). Standardized data models and service interfaces charac-
terized the data sharing capabilities of these government-led GIIs, although only a
small group of specialized, tech-savvy users beneﬁtted from them. At that time, the
concept of openness was tightly coupled to the idea of sharing. The democratization
of data sharing through GIIs was a great leap to facilitate transnational and multidis-
ciplinary projects because the problems of discovery, access and redundancy of GI
were signiﬁcantly alleviated by standardized and uniﬁed mechanisms. Most recently,
this led to the offerings of location enabled e-Services using web-based application
programming interfaces (APIs) built upon SDIs. One example of this is the devel-
opment of an application for citizens called Spotbooking to apply for, process and
maintain uses of public spaces within a town or city (Spotbooking 2019).
In addition to past studies to ﬁnd synergies bridging geospatial research data
with public sector information and open data initiatives, other relevant open
trends/movements enable knowledge/data collection, creation and dissemination and
mostly operate outside GIIs (Schade et al. 2015). We do not list the multitude of open
trends and their technological infrastructure here but highlight a few examples to
underline the evolving meaning of openness from data sharing to dynamic processes
for knowledge production and dissemination. One example is the European Open
Science Cloud (EOSC 2019), a cloud for research data in Europe that supports the
ongoing transitions in how research is performed and how knowledge is shared. As
a second example, the IoT infrastructure generates a vast amount of spatiotemporal
data streams at a ﬁner granularity, which undoubtedly represent valuable sources of
176
S. Schade et al.
data (i.e., ‘things’ observe the environment by collecting data) and analytical com-
putation (i.e., ‘things’ act by processing gathered data) for Digital Earth and GIIs.
Granell et al. feature the promising bridges and synergies between the IoT and Digital
Earth application scenarios in Chap. 11, but a true convergence of the two infras-
tructures is still in its infancy. As a third example, the relationship between Digital
Earth and citizen science is outlined in detail in this book by Brovelli and others
(Chap. 18).
Fast-forwarding to the present, openness has become a more prominent concept
than ever. It has been transformed and extended to all aspects of people’s daily lives
(Price 2013). Contrary to the common perception of openness in the ﬁrst example,
which was practically restricted to ‘sharing’ data, today’s vision of openness takes
multiple and varied forms (Sui 2014). Openness permeates many facets of today’s
culture, society, government, science and education, leading to a series of (old and
new) ‘open terms’ such as open culture, open cities (Domingo et al. 2013; Degbelo
et al. 2016), open movement (Lee et al. 2015), open government (Lathrop and Ruma
2010; Goldsmith and Kleiman 2017), open software (Aksulu and Wade 2010), open
hardware (Powell 2012), open science, open research, open laboratories (Nosek et al.
2015), open innovation (Schade and Granell 2014; Mathieu and Aubrecht 2018), and
open education (Bonk et al. 2015). In contrast, as analyzed below, daily (geospatial)
information still ﬂows to platforms that are not deﬁned as open and are owned by
the above-mentioned companies. Offering services free of charge but in exchange
for personal (user-generated) data has become a popular business model.
We argue that peoples’ perception of openness is dramatically inﬂuenced by the
irruption, rapid adoption, and new uses and appropriations of technology. Digital
transformations brought changes in the proliferation of new data sources, the con-
solidation of novel ways of producing and consuming data, and in the demography
of users. The cost of creating GI anywhere, at any time, from anyone, about anything
(aka 4-A technology) drastically decreased. However, the cost for current GIIs to
consume, integrate and make sense of 4A-generated data is still considerable—espe-
cially when considering the direct and indirect costs for the provision and application
of 4-A-generated data for a rich portfolio of use cases and stakeholders (Johnson et al.
2017). The scale, frequency, and granularity of the data being generated and gath-
ered today were simply unimaginable when the foundations of GIIs were designed
many years ago. The motto “collected once, shared multiple times” is no longer a
fundamental truth that drives GIIs because anyone can collect data on the same phe-
nomenon, in the same place, from multiple perspectives, which was previously tech-
nically infeasible. In fact, we unconsciously create such GIs all the time. As a result,
more and more data sources are available for a single phenomenon, requiring addi-
tional analytical approaches and interoperability arrangements to integrate these data
sources and offer a comprehensive picture about the phenomenon in question (Huang
et al. 2018). Thus, data in traditional (governmental) GIIs provide one perspective
of a phenomenon (mobility, pollution, demography, etc.). Other perspectives of that
phenomenon are provided by data that are collected via other infrastructures. This
does not fully address the concept of openness. Openness means sharing data about
a phenomenon for small groups of experts, enabling and promoting comprehensible
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
177
views of phenomena taken from disparate sources, and making them accessible and
understandable to various user groups. What characteristics do modern GIIs need to
fully exploit 4A-generated data? What does this imply in terms of interoperability?
And how does this impact current approaches to openness?
While common sense tells us that the way to solve the growing complexity of
today’s social challenges and underlying research problems is through multidisci-
plinary collaboration at all levels including technical infrastructures, access to data,
and participation in the creation and dissemination of knowledge, the reality is that
the diversity of ‘open’ trends is understandable considering the diversity of actors that
have different objectives and needs and are affected differently by a constantly chang-
ing technological landscape. It appears that each actor (citizens, NGOs, scientists,
private companies, government, etc.) has a different understanding of the meaning
and application of the notion of openness. All of them are entirely legitimate given
the contexts in which each of the different stakeholders operate.
Regardless of any controversy about the future meaning of openness, it is clear that
‘open’ cannot be considered a static feature of data or of GII, but should be considered
under the lens of recent trends and critiques as a dynamic process for the production,
creation and dissemination of knowledge, which is subject to improvements and
optimizations over time. The reconceptualization of openness as a dynamic process
is vital to enable convergent points and bridges among emerging movements and
GIIs—which still operate rather disconnectedly—to make sense of the vast amounts
of collected data to solve the pressing issues facing the Earth today. We can rephrase
the previous questions: What characteristics would deﬁne such dynamic processes
in GIIs to exploit 4A-generated data?
Leading GIS scientists recently reﬂected on the current limitations of the ﬁeld
and called for an entirely new brand of geospatial algorithms and techniques to
analyze and process these new forms of data (Jiang 2015; Miller and Goodchild
2015; Li et al. 2016). Lü et al. (2019) magniﬁcently summarize this perception in
one sentence: “a successful past [of GII] does not guarantee a bright future” (pp
347). The historical view of GII reported in this chapter is indisputably a story of
success. Nevertheless, new driving forces and trends such as open movements and
open information infrastructures—along with the dataﬁcation and platformization of
society—have had and will have signiﬁcant impacts on the future success of GIIs, so
GIIs should carefully consider them to explore alliances and actively integrate and
process new forms of information sources.
5.3.3
Capacity Building and Learning for Geospatial
Information Infrastructures
Although appropriate technologies and policies to enable data access and data shar-
ing are crucial in the development of GIIs, it also requires education and capacity
building to ensure the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies are available
178
S. Schade et al.
(Craglia et al. 2008). Complementing more general frameworks on the development
of digital skills (van Deursen and van Dijk 2014), the need for collaboration between
government, businesses and academics in the development of an appropriate knowl-
edge infrastructure has been reﬂected in national and regional GII strategies and
actions (Vancauwenberghe and Vandenbroucke 2016). In the past 20 years, various
education and training initiatives on GII and related topics have been developed and
implemented by higher education institutions, public administrations and businesses.
Throughout the years, the focus has broadly shifted from raising awareness of the
potential of GI, to capacity building for the implementation of different GII com-
ponents to skills and knowledge related to the use and integration of GII data and
services in decision making, service delivery and product development processes.
GII education and training also must be dynamic and change in response to new
technological and policy-related developments. The key challenge in successful GII
education and training is to ensure that it addresses the needs of GII professional
developers and users. Demand-driven GII education and training requires insight in
and agreement on what professionals in the domain of GII should know and be able to
do (Vandenbroucke and Vancauwenberghe 2016). Studies investigating the demand
for GII capacity building have been undertaken at organizational, national and cross-
national levels. A European-wide study on the workforce demand in the domain of
GISandT showed that, despite differences in the tasks they perform, employees and
representatives from the different sectors including public administration, private
sector and academia have strongly similar views on the skills and knowledge areas
they consider the most relevant (Wallentin et al. 2014). The European GI community
identiﬁed a shift in focus from map making and local database handling towards
online and mobile technologies based on SDIs with a massive amount of—open—
data to be integrated. This is a clear indication that the importance of capacity building
for GII will increase in the near future.
A valuable approach in the identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc knowledge and skills
that professionals need to master for career success in their ﬁeld is the development
of a comprehensive inventory of the knowledge domain. To provide such an inven-
tory for the GISandT domain, in 2006 the University Consortium of Geographic
Information Science (UCGIS) developed the Geographic Information Science and
Technology Body of Knowledge (GISandT BoK) (DiBiase et al. 2006). The main
intended use of the GISandT BoK was to support the development and assessment
of GISandT curricula, but the document also serves other purposes such as for pro-
fessional accreditation or screening of employees. The 2006 version of the Body of
Knowledge included more than 330 topics organized into seventy-three units and ten
knowledge areas. Notably, the concept of ‘spatial data infrastructure’ was included
twice, in two different knowledge areas: once in the knowledge area of geospatial
data (as a topic under the ‘Metadata, standards and infrastructures’ unit) and once
in the organizational and institutional aspects knowledge area (as a topic under the
Institutional and interinstitutional aspects unit). This reﬂects the need for training
and education on the technological and organizational (or institutional) aspects of
SDI. In addition to the concept of spatial data infrastructure, the Body of Knowledge
contains other concepts that are linked or relevant to the development of SDIs and
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
179
GIIs, spread across different knowledge areas and units. This demonstrates the rele-
vance and importance of GIIs as a ﬁeld and the need for an ontology-based approach
to the ﬁeld, where different types of relationships between concepts can be identiﬁed
(Vandenbroucke and Vancauwenberghe 2016).
To reﬂect and address recent trends, developments and challenges in the GISandT
domain, continuous revision and updating of the Body of Knowledge are required.
Initiatives to revise and update the Body of Knowledge have been undertaken and
are ongoing in Europe and the United States (Vandenbroucke and Vancauwenberghe
2016). In addition to the topics covered and deﬁned learning objectives, another key
aspect in the design and implementation of GII training and education is the teaching
and learning activities applied to help students achieve these objectives. GII educa-
tion has evolved from traditional ‘teacher-centric’ teaching styles to more ‘learner-
centric’ methods and approaches. With the availability of online—open—education
resources by organizations and institutions such as the EuroSDR (EduServ program),
the University of Salzburg (UNIGIS program), the Geographical Information Sys-
tem International Group (GISIG) and recently the European Commission (Geospatial
Knowledge Base (GKB) Training Platform), the GI/GII community has a strong tra-
dition of e-learning activities. Collaboration between higher education institutions
and other stakeholders to design and deliver GI and GII education has taken place for
many years. In many cases, this collaboration is often organized in a rather traditional
manner, through internships at public or private organizations, the provision of data
and tools for educational purposes, and the organization of study visits and excur-
sions to private or public organizations in the GISandT domain (Vancauwenberghe
and Vandenbroucke 2016). Recently, several universities started experimenting with
more case-based approaches in which students and teachers closely collaborate with
practitioners on real-life case studies. The concept of academic SDIs for research
and for education can be viewed in the context of adopting more innovative teaching
and learning methods (Coetzee et al. 2017). Students could actively contribute to the
development and implementation of various SDI components and use the infrastruc-
ture to share the results of their efforts with other students, teachers and researchers.
In addition, GIIs play a role in the cocreation of knowledge and thereby in life-
long learning (Foresman et al. 2014), and through their fundamental contribution to
the Digital Earth vision, GIIs can enable living labs, i.e., user-driven approaches to
innovation (Schade and Granell 2014).
5.4
Recent Challenges and Potential for Improvement
Given the situation today—as indicated in the introduction to this chapter—we face
a series of challenges. These challenges primarily emerge from the pace of techno-
logical change, including more frequent technological disruptions than in the past,
and the (to some extent heavy-headed) standardization applied to GIIs. We note the
challenges caused by what we call the ‘big data’ phenomenon (Tsinaraki and Schade
2016) and by the mainstreaming of GI, which introduced new users with new needs
180
S. Schade et al.
as well as new providers of GII. Given these current changes and challenges, we
emphasize two implications for GIIs and their future evolution.
5.4.1
Strengthened Role of Semantics
The insight that semantic heterogeneity is a key factor that interferes with the effec-
tive use and analysis of GI from different sources is by no means new, nor are the
solutions based on semantic web technologies to address the corresponding chal-
lenges (Kuhn 2005; Lutz and Klien 2007; Lutz et al. 2009). However, although
academic research noted these issues quite early on in the establishment of SDIs, in
practice, most efforts have been focused on achieving the underlying technical and
syntactic interoperability. This focus is understandable, as semantic interoperability
only becomes an issue when the technical and syntactical issues are largely solved.
This stage in the development of GII appears to have been reached, since the role
of geospatial semantics has been strengthened considerably and is now an issue that
practitioners deal with in implementation of open data platforms and geospatial web
services.
Arguably, this development was not solely driven by questions about the semantics
of geospatial data at hand. Rather, the need for approaches that let us add information
about the semantics of entities (geospatial features, in our case), particularly their
types and properties, has been recognized in many other ﬁelds. These include generic
examples such as the publication of structured data on the web (Schema.org is the
most prominent example) or specialized application domains (such as biology or his-
tory), and closely related research ﬁelds such as the sensor web and the Internet of
Things. The common need for structured data with clearly deﬁned semantics across
those domains has led to efforts in a number of different directions, including research
on the theoretical underpinnings of semantic reasoning (Noy 2004; Wang et al. 2004),
development of speciﬁcations [RDF(S) (Staab et al. 2002), OWL (McGuinness and
Van Harmelen 2004), OWL2 (Hitzler et al. 2009; Motik et al. 2009), query languages
[SPARQL (Harris et al. 2013), GeoSPARQL (Battle and Kolas 2012)], implemen-
tation of the triple stores (Rohloff et al. 2007) and query engines (Broekstra et al.
2002; Carroll et al. 2004). In combination, these efforts have led to a more widespread
adoption of approaches that focus on the semantics of geospatial data (Stock et al.
2011), and semantics is now front and center in best practice recommendations for
publishing spatial data (W3C 2019).
The W3C’s Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices discusses how to best seman-
tically annotate geospatial data—, i.e., using shared vocabularies—and recommends
full-ﬂedged adoption of Linked Data principles. A more widespread adoption of these
best practices will imply a paradigm shift (Kuhn et al. 2014) towards a radically dis-
tributed approach to the publication of GI. Linked Data are currently treated as a
byproduct in the publication of GI, e.g., when government agencies such as the UK’s
Ordinance Survey are starting to offer their GI as Linked Data or when universities
convert OSM data to Linked Data. These are valuable efforts—a little semantics goes
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
181
a long way (Hendler 2009)—but the data that is being published is still the output
of an extract-transform-load (ETL) process on top of an original data source such as
a relational spatial database. Furthermore, the provision of GI as Linked Data only
adds another data offering with the potential use for data integration. Actual success
cases remain rare.
The opportunities and challenges of making Linked Data the original data format
based on which all changes are made and from which other formats can be derived
can currently be observed in the Wikidata effort (Vrandeˇci´c and Krötzsch 2014).
After the immense success of DBpedia (Auer et al. 2007)—a Linked Data product
generated via ETL from the structured information in Wikipedia—the potential of
turning this process around by making the produced structured data the actual data
underlying all language editions of Wikipedia has been recognized. This approach
now allows for an editor to update information in Wikidata—such as the population
number for a country after a new census, or the publication of the latest book by a
given author—and that information can automatically be reused across all Wikipedia.
GI still has a way to go in making a semantics-based approach its primary for-
mat for data management and publication, and thus become part of an ever-growing
distributed knowledge graph. Conceived as part of the infrastructure driving Digi-
tal Earth, this goal appears attractive, particularly because of its potential to further
normalize the use GI across a wider range of disciplines. However, a number of
challenges must be addressed before this vision can be put into practice, including
the development and implementation of standardized handling of GI in triple stores,
interfaces to access geospatial Linked Data directly from GI ‘front ends’ such as
traditional GIS, web-based and mobile mapping applications, as well as capacity
building, particularly in the form of educating students in the underlying technol-
ogy stack so that they can help with these developments after graduation. These
challenges highlight the fact that geospatial semantics will remain an essential and
dedicated research area for the foreseeable future, helping users make sensible use
of GI and turn it into actionable knowledge. Finally, in the context of Linked Data,
(geo)spatial information is deﬁnitely special because spatial (and particularly spa-
tiotemporal) data can be used as an integrator to help build connections between
originally disparate data sources.
5.4.2
Is Spatial Still Special?
There are several slogans related to GI, including “spatial is special”. Although one
might argue that GI is only more complex than many kinds of (nonspatial) informa-
tion, at least in the past, geospatial informatics ﬁlled a niche role with comparably few
specialists working on the topic. As far as mainstream computing was concerned,
the spatial-temporal components of GI were restricted to a pair of coordinates (a
point) and a date-time stamp. Today, the spatiotemporal characteristics of GI have
made it popular for data integration tasks, where location is an obvious commonality
between many separately collected data sources (Tsinaraki and Schade 2016). In
182
S. Schade et al.
combination with the recent trend towards platformization of society and wider use
of remotely sensed images, online maps, sensors (see also Chap. 11), as well as peo-
ple’s location and tracks, one might argue that the time when (geo)spatial has been
special has come to an end. However, although the collection of GI has become much
easier (and hence gone mainstream), pitfalls in analysis (spatial autocorrelation, pro-
jections, etc.) remain. Related special challenges surface, especially when standard
approaches for handling big data are directly applied to GI. Many of the common
“divide and conquer” approaches applied to big data analysis tasks fail because of
the spatial relationships between chunks of data. As argued in Sect. 5.4.1, semantics
is highly important. Using colocation as the only element for data integration can
easily lead to the senseless combined processing of data from completely different
and potentially conﬂicting contexts.
The mainstreaming of location information has direct implications for the evolu-
tion of GII, as with the future conceptualization of GIS and SDIs. In the past, these
notions were a research and application ﬁeld in their own right, and they now appear
to be much more integrated into the wider ﬁelds of computer science and data science
(Cadell 2018). With a narrow view, this could be seen as a thread to the communities
and associations that formed around these concepts (the introduction to this chapter
provided some examples of these). Conversely, the mainstreaming of GI provides
immense opportunities such as the increasing market for companies specializing in
GI and many new job opportunities for GI experts.
From a government perspective, GIIs became more relevant—and geospatial data
less special—through the use of data in this infrastructure for the provision of spa-
tially enabled e-government services to citizens, businesses and other societal actors
(Vancauwenberghe and van Loenen 2018). Geospatial data that became increasingly
available were used to improve existing e-services and provide novel services. Such
spatially enabled e-services now exist in many policy areas (i.e., environment, agri-
culture,transport)andatdifferentlevelsofgovernment(i.e.,local,regional,national).
They evolved from more simple information and contact services to more advanced
transaction services. These spatially enabled transaction services refer to the use of
geospatial data in the electronic intake and handling of requests and applications of
rights, beneﬁts and obligations. Because these transaction services demand multiple
two-way interactions between governments and citizens/businesses, they are more
complex than information or contact services, which are mostly one-way services.
This increased complexity applies to both technological and organizational aspects,
since the delivery of these e-services requires a strong alignment and possible inte-
gration of GIIs with e-government developments. Initiatives to enable this integration
have been taken at organizational, national and regional levels—especially in Europe
(Vancauwenberghe and van Loenen 2018).
In the private sector, we have observed manifold developments. First, the tra-
ditional partnerships with the public sector evolved into collaborations in which
governmental bodies such as mapping agencies still own and provide authoritative
content (such as cadaster information, protected sites, and utilities), and the industry
offers solutions for data hosting, access, and cost recovery. The data and information
access services (DIAS) for the European Space program Copernicus is a particularly
5
Geospatial Information Infrastructures
183
impressive example (Copernicus 2019). In each of these ﬁve different implementa-
tions, the public-sector GII is coupled with data from commercial satellites to provide
additional value. Second, there are an increasing number of companies building upon
GIIs. Especially for technologies such as web-based APIs, as in the example of Spot-
booking, GI has become more accessible and value-added services and applications
have been created. Due to the abovementioned platformization, large internet ﬁrms
create many GIs and host them in their infrastructures, and they are only occasion-
ally linked to existing public-sector GIIs. GI has clearly moved into the mainstream
information infrastructures. Lastly, many GI projects today rely on data provided by
companies such as Google, DigitalGlobe, Waze, Here, and Esri. Examples include
geospatial data about commercial demographics and personal mobility.
In the context of Digital Earth, these developments are all good news. In every con-
ceptualization of the Digital Earth vision—and in any future evolution thereof—GI
and GIIs will remain fundamental building blocks. As increasing related expertise
becomes available and the mainstreaming trend of GI continues, GI can provide
the capacity that is required for improving Digital Earth applications and enlarging
implementations of the Digital Earth vision across the globe. The transition from
mainstreamed GI to GIIs that are readily available to developers and implementers
of the Digital Earth vision is the logical next step and an area for further research and
organizational improvements. The interplay between and the changes in power rela-
tionships between society, research, industry and the public sector deserve dedicated
attention.
5.5
Conclusion and Outlook
This chapter situated GIIs in the wider context of the Digital Earth vision and intro-
duced GIIs as a major enabling element for Digital Earth implementation. The past
and present of GIIs was outlined along with a subjective view of today’s major
challenges concerning the status of GII development and use, and possible future
directions. Notably, this view might be biased towards academia and governments,
but we have highlighted emerging developments from the private sector as a disrup-
tive driving force that quickly emerged over the past decade.
This chapter demonstrates that GIIs have come a long way and evolved as a strong
underpinning contribution for implementation of the Digital Earth vision. Whereas
we witnessed a dispersion of efforts in the early days, we illustrated how GIIs evolved
and coordinated efforts emerged in different national and international contexts. The
increasing pace of technological changes poses new challenges to the continuation
and further convergence of these efforts because new actors with different back-
grounds and expectations enter the discussion. We see a particular need to continue
and strengthen the role of semantics in GII development and implementation to
ensure that the provided information can be used appropriately. We also recognize
the changing power relationship from the public to the private sector, with a disrupt-
ing effect on traditional data owners (especially mapping agencies). These changes
184
S. Schade et al.
will signiﬁcantly affect the role of the public sector in geospatial data management
and provision.
Lastly, we underlined the needs for further evolution of GIIs so that they become
ﬂexible and robust enough to absorb and embrace technological transformations and
the accompanying societal and organizational implications. These required capaci-
ties for addressing technological and organizational issues, and training of present
and future generations of GII developers and GII users. As a prominent example, we
highlighted the relationships to movements to open up data and the access to knowl-
edge. GIIs—which were in the forefront of open data sharing in the past—must react
to changing conditions, provide bridges to other existing infrastructures to absorb
new data sources, and contribute to the development of new standards for collab-
oration. The next generation of GIIs should provide management and processing
capacities for classical GI, and must be able to input and handle novel information
sources. In this way, they will continue to fuel innovation for the future of Digital
Earth. Chapters 6, 9 and 10 provide additional insight into analytical aspects and
issues related to big data. For details about the economic value of Digital Earth, we
refer the reader to Chap. 19.

Abstract The increasing availability of geospatial data offers great opportunities
for advancing scientiﬁc discovery and practices in society. Effective and efﬁcient
processing of geospatial data is essential for a wide range of Digital Earth applica-
tions such as climate change, natural hazard prediction and mitigation, and public
health. However, the massive volume, heterogeneous, and distributed nature of global
geospatial data pose challenges in geospatial information processing and comput-
ing. This chapter introduces three technologies for geospatial data processing: high-
performance computing, online geoprocessing, and distributed geoprocessing, with
each technology addressing one aspect of the challenges. The fundamental concepts,
principles, and key techniques of the three technologies are elaborated in detail, fol-
lowed by examples of applications and research directions in the context of Digital
Earth. Lastly, a Digital Earth reference framework called discrete global grid system
(DGGS) is discussed.

Introduction
With the advancement of sensor and computing technologies, massive volumes of
geospatial data are being produced at an increasingly faster speed from a variety
of geo-sensors (e.g., in situ and remote sensors) and model simulations (e.g., cli-
mate models) with increasing spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. For exam-
ple, satellite sensors are collecting petabytes data daily. Climate model simula-
tions by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists produce hundreds
of petabytes of climate data (Schnase et al. 2017). In addition to these traditional
data sources, geospatial data collected from ubiquitous location-based sensors and
billions of human sensors (Goodchild 2007) are becoming more dynamic, heteroge-
neous, unstructured, and noisy.
These massive volumes of geospatial data offer great opportunities for advancing
scientiﬁc discovery and practices in society, which could beneﬁt a wide range of
applications of Digital Earth such as climate change, natural hazard prediction and
mitigation, and public health. In this sense, efﬁciently and effectively retrieving infor-
mation and deriving knowledge from the massive geospatial datasets have become
critical functions of Digital Earth. The questions that can be (or should be) addressed
with Digital Earth include, for example, how to investigate and identify unknown
and complex patterns from the large trajectory data of a city to better understand
human mobility patterns (e.g., Hu et al. 2019a, b), how to rapidly collect and process
heterogeneous and distributed hazard datasets during a hurricane to support decision
making (e.g., Martin et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018), how to synthesize huge datasets
to quickly identify the spatial relationships between two climate variables (e.g., Li
et al. 2019), and how to ﬁnd spatial and temporal patterns of human activities dur-
ing disasters in massive datasets that are notoriously “dirty” and biased population
samples (e.g., Twitter data) in a scalable environment (e.g., Li et al. 2018).
Geospatial information computing refers to the computational tasks of making
sense of geospatial data. Such tasks mainly include but are not limited to geospatial
data storage, management, processing, analysis, and mining. Addressing the above
questions poses great challenges for geospatial information computing. First, the
volume of the geospatial data at the global scale (e.g., at the petabyte-scale) exceeds
the capacity of traditional computing technologies and analytical tools designed for
the desktop era. The velocity of data acquisition (e.g., terabytes of satellite images a
day and tens of thousands of geotagged tweets a minute) pushes the limits of tradi-
tional data storage and computing techniques. Second, geospatial data are inherently
heterogeneous. They are collected from different sources (e.g., Earth observations,
social media), abstracted with different data models (e.g., raster, vector, array-based),
encoded with different data formats (e.g., geodatabase, NetCDF), and have different
space and time resolutions. This heterogeneity requires interoperability and standards
among the data processing tools or spatial analysis functions. For example, producing
timely decision support often requires combining multiple data sources with multiple
tools. Moreover, with the involvement of multiple tools and datasets in the problem-
solving process, data provenance, analysis transparency, and result reproducibility
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies

become increasingly important. Third, global geospatial data are often physically
distributed. They are collected by distributed sensors and stored at data servers all
over the world. Moving data from one location such as local server to another such
as cloud for processing becomes problematic due to the high volume, high velocity,
and necessity of real-time decision making.
A variety of processing and computing technologies have been developed or
adapted to tackle these challenges. Figure 6.1 depicts a geospatial information com-
puting framework of Digital Earth, highlighting three types of popular technologies
in geospatial information computing: high-performance computing (HPC, Sect. 6.2),
online geospatial information processing (or online geoprocessing, Sect. 6.3),
and distributed geospatial information processing (or distributed geoprocessing,
Sect. 6.4). HPC aims to tackle the large-volume challenge by solving data- and
computing-intensive problems in parallel using multiple or many processing units
(e.g., GPU, CPU, computers). Online geoprocessing comprises techniques that allow

performance computing, online geoprocessing, and distributed geoprocessing

for performing data processing and spatial analysis tasks on the web using geospatial
web services (e.g., OGC web services) or web APIs (e.g., RESTful). Through stan-
dardization, these services and APIs are essential for addressing the heterogeneity
challenges of geospatial data. Distributed geoprocessing refers to processing geospa-
tial data and information in a distributed computing environment. By chaining a set
of distributed data processing services into an executable workﬂow, the datasets and
analysis steps involved in a task are documented, which improves the reproducibility
of the analysis.
The following three sections start with a brief introduction and deﬁnition of a
technology followed by its key principles, techniques, and examples of applications
that support Digital Earth. Research challenges and future directions are discussed at
the end of each section. A summary of the three technologies and a discussion of the
discrete global grid system (DGGS) are provided in the last section. This chapter is
not intended to be comprehensive or cover all aspects and technologies of geospatial
information computing. The three selected technologies are described to provide the
readers with a sense of geoinformation processing and how it is applied to support
Digital Earth.

High-Performance Computing
6.2.1
The Concept of High-Performance Computing: What
and Why
HPC aims to solve complex computational problems using supercomputers and par-
allel processing techniques. Since commodity clusters revolutionized HPC twenty
years ago, a price-performance standard has become dominant, which includes inex-
pensive, high-performance x86 processors, functional accelerators (e.g., Intel Xeon
Phi or NVidia Tesla), and open source Linux software and associated toolkits. It has
been widely used in various applications such as weather forecasting, nuclear test
simulation, and molecular dynamics simulation.
Thegrowingavailabilityofspatialdatasets,intheformofGPSvehicletrajectories,
social media check-ins, earth observation imagery, and sensor readings pose serious
challenges for researchers and tool users in geo-related ﬁelds. The currently available
computational technology constrains researchers and users in geo-related ﬁelds in
two ways. First, the size of problems that can be addressed using the currently
available methods is limited. Additionally, new problems, patterns, research, and
decisions that may be discovered from geospatial big data cannot be found using
existing tools. The 3 “V” s of big geospatial data (volume, variety, and velocity)
impose new requirements for computational technology for geospatial information
processing, for example, large, cheap, and reliable storage for large amounts of data,
as well as scalable algorithms to process data in real time. Due to its computational
capability, HPC is well suited for geospatial information processing of geospatial
6

big data. A highly integrated and reliable software infrastructure ecosystem based
on HPC will facilitate geo-related applications in two ways. First, it will scale up
the data volume and data granularity of data management, mining, and analysis,
which has not been possible in the desktop era using the currently available methods.
Furthermore, it will inspire and enable new discoveries with novel big-data-oriented
methods that are not implementable in the current desktop software.
In the following, we describe HPC platforms frequently used in geospatial infor-
mation processing, and look at how HPC is applied in spatial database management
systems and spatial data mining.
6.2.2
High-Performance Computing Platforms
Since HPC was introduced in the 1960s, parallelism has been introduced into the
systems. In parallelization, a computational task is divided into several, often very
similar, subtasks that can be processed in parallel and the results are combined upon
completion. The direct computational time savings of HPC systems results from the
execution of multiple processing elements at the same time to solve a problem. The
process of dividing a computational task is called decomposition. Task interaction
necessitates communication between processing elements, and thus increasing gran-
ularity does not always result in faster computation. There are three major sources
of overhead in parallel systems: interprocess interaction, idling, and excess compu-
tation. Interprocess interaction is the time spent communicating data between pro-
cessing elements, which is usually the most signiﬁcant source. Idling occurs when
processing elements stop execution due to load imbalance, synchronization, or the
presence of serial components in a program. Excess computation represents the extra
time cost of adopting a parallel algorithm based on a poorer but easily paralleliz-
able algorithm rather than the fastest known sequential algorithm that is difﬁcult or
impossible to parallelize.
To facilitate the parallelism of HPC systems, the architecture of HPC systems dic-
tates the use of special programming techniques. Commonly used HPC platforms for
large-scale processing of spatial data include the Message Passing Interface (MPI),
Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), Uniﬁed Parallel C (UPC), general-purpose com-
puting on graphics processing units (GPGPU), Apache Hadoop, and Apache Spark.
These platforms can be roughly classiﬁed according to the level at which the hardware
supports parallelism.
OpenMP, MPI, and UPC support parallelism on central processing units (CPUs).
OpenMP is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory parallel program-
ming in C/C++ and Fortran; MPI is the most commonly used standardized and
portable message-passing standard, which is designed to function on a wide vari-
ety of parallel computing architectures. There are several well-tested and efﬁcient
implementations of MPI for users programming in C/C++ and Fortran. They can
work cooperatively in a computer cluster such that OpenMP is used for parallel
data processing within individual computers while MPI is used for message passing
196
Z. Li et al.
between computers. UPC extends the C programming language to present a single
shared, partitioned address space to the programmer, where each variable may be
directly read and written by any processor but is physically possessed by a single
processor.
The GPGPU platform performs computations that are traditionally conducted by
CPUs using graphic processing units (GPUs). Architecturally, a CPU is composed of
a few cores that can handle complex tasks whereas a GPU is composed of hundreds
of cores for simple tasks, so a GPU can dwarf the calculation rate of many CPUs if
the computational task can be decomposed to simple subtasks that can be handled
by a GPU’s core. The GPGPU is programmed using programming models such as
CUDA or OpenCL.
Due to the popularity of commodity computer clusters, the MapReduce program-
ming model was introduced to maintain their reliability. Apache Hadoop, which is a
collection of open-source software utilities based on the MapReduce programming
model, can automatically handle hardware failures that are assumed to be common.
Apache Spark was developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce model,
which forces a linear dataﬂow structure to read and write from disk. Instead of a
hard drive disk, Apache Spark functions on distributed shared memory. Figure 6.2
illustrates how HPC platforms support both spatial database management systems
and spatial data mining.
The abovementioned HPC platforms facilitate the realization of several HPC
applications such as cloud computing, newly emerging edge computing (Shi et al.
2016) and fog computing (Bonomi et al. 2012). Cloud computing is the on-demand
availability of computational resources such as data storage and computing power
without direct active management by the users. It emphasizes the accessibility to
HPC over the Internet (“the cloud”). As the cost of computers and sensors contin-
uously decrease and the computational power of small-footprint devices (such as

puting include more processing elements such as end devices in the Internet of Things
in the computer clusters.
6.2.3
Spatial Database Management Systems and Spatial
Data Mining
A database management system (DBMS) is a computerized system for deﬁning,
creating, querying, updating, and managing a database. It provides persistence across
failures, concurrency control, and scalability to search queries of datasets that do not
ﬁt inside the main memories of computers. Spatial DBMSs are software modules that
can work with an underlying DBMS; they were developed to handle spatial queries
that cannot be handled by a traditional DBMS, for example, listing the names of all
employees living within one kilometer of a company (Shekhar and Chawla 2003).
Spatial DBMSs are an essential component of spatial data storage and management
for geospatial information processing.
Spatial data mining is the process of quantifying and discovering interesting, pre-
viously unknown, potentially useful pattern families from large spatial datasets such
as maps, trajectories, and remote sensing images (Shekhar et al. 2015). Compared
with traditional data mining, spatial data mining has three special challenges. First,
objects in space exhibit spatial dependence at nearby locations as well as distant
locations. The spatial dependence at nearby locations is called the spatial autocor-
relation effect. It is also known as Tobler’s ﬁrst law of geography: “Everything is
related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” For
example, people tend to cluster together with others that share similar characteris-
tics, occupation, and background. Examples of long-range spatial dependence, i.e.,
spatial tele-coupling, include El Niño and La Niña effects on the climate system.
A second challenge is that spatial data is embedded in a continuous space whereas
classical datasets are often discrete. Third, spatial heterogeneity and temporal non-
stationarity make it difﬁcult to ﬁnd a global law that is valid across an entire space
and for all time. In other words, spatial context matters. Consequently, classical data
mining algorithms often perform poorly when applied to spatial data sets and thus
more powerful methods such as spatial statistics and spatial data mining are needed.
Spatial statistics (Cressie and Wikle 2015) provides theories (e.g., spatial point
process, geostatistics, and lattice statistics), models (e.g., spatial autoregression
model), and methods (e.g., Kriging) for spatial data mining. Spatial data mining
focuses on ﬁve pattern families, namely, outliers, colocations and tele-couplings,
location prediction, hotspots, and spatiotemporal change. A spatial outlier is deﬁned
as a spatially referenced object whose nonspatial attribute values are inconsistent
with those of other objects in its spatial neighborhood (Shekhar et al. 2003). Con-
trary to global outliers, whose nonspatial attributes are compared with the remainder
of the dataset, the attributes of spatial outliers are compared with a local subset of
198
Z. Li et al.
data around their footprints. For example, a road intersection where the vehicle speed
is much higher than in other intersections nearby is a spatial outlier although it may
not be a global outlier compared with other intersections in the city.
Spatial colocations represent subsets of spatial event types whose instances are
often located in close geographic proximity (Huang et al. 2004). For example, the
Nile crocodile and the Egyptian plover are frequently colocated, which indicates their
symbiotic relationship. Other common colocation patterns include the colocation of
the fast food restaurants McDonald’s, Burger King, and KFC; the colocation of
shopping malls with movie theaters; and the colocation of bars and drunk driving.
Spatial tele-coupling represents interactions across distant locations. For example,
the El Niño weather pattern (warming of the Paciﬁc Ocean) affects the weather
thousands of miles away in the midwestern and eastern United States.
Location prediction aims to learn a model to infer the location of a spatial phe-
nomenon from maps of other spatial features. Examples include learning land-cover
classiﬁcation maps, predicting yearly crop yield, and predicting habitats for endan-
gered species. Classical data mining techniques yield weak prediction models as
they do not capture the spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity in spatial datasets.
Ignoring spatial autocorrelation often results in salt-and-pepper noise, i.e., locations
whose predicted land-cover class is very different from the predicted land-cover
classes of its neighboring locations. Such problems are signiﬁcantly reduced by
spatial autocorrelation-aware location prediction methods such as spatial autore-
gression, Markov random ﬁeld-based Bayesian classiﬁers, and spatial decision trees
(Jiang et al. 2015). Spatial heterogeneity, which prevents single-learner methods
(e.g., neural networks and random forests) from accurately learning a global model
is considered by spatial ensemble methods as well as Gaussian multiple instance
learning methods (Jiang et al. 2017).
Spatial hotspots represent spatial regions where the concentration of objects inside
the region is signiﬁcantly higher than that outside. Hotspot analysis is widely used
in public health and public safety to identify hotspots of disease and crime, respec-
tively. False positives and true negatives carry high costs in such settings. Incorrectly
labeling a neighborhood a disease or crime hotspot may lead to stigmatization and
signiﬁcant economic loss, and missing true hotspots of disease may lead to pre-
ventable mortalities and disease burden.
Spatiotemporal change may be deﬁned in several ways. It may be a change in
a statistical parameter, where the data are assumed to follow a distribution and the
change is a shift of this distribution. It may be a change in actual value, where
the change is deﬁned as the difference between a data value and its spatiotemporal
neighborhood. It may also refer to a change in models ﬁtted to data, where the change
is deﬁned as a change in the models ﬁtted to the data. Studies have been conducted
to ﬁnd more scalable algorithms for biomass monitoring using Gaussian process
learning (Chandola and Vatsavai 2011).
There are many other interesting, useful and nontrivial patterns of interest in
spatial data mining. For example, emerging hotspot detection aims to detect disease
outbreak well before an outbreak results in a large number of cases. Interested readers
are referred to papers on spatial data mining (Shekhar et al. 2011, 2015) and parallel

computing algorithms for GIS (Healey et al. 1997; Shekhar et al. 1996, 1998; Zhao
et al. 2016) for additional details.
6.2.4
Applications Supporting Digital Earth
Spatial database management systems using HPC have been studied extensively.
Since Hadoop was introduced and its ability to handle big data in computer clus-
ters was demonstrated, researchers and savvy tool users have taken advantage of
it in various ways. Some tools and studies use Hadoop as a black box for opera-
tions on data, such as GIS tools for Hadoop, a package composed of programming
libraries and an add-on toolbox of ArcGIS desktop (ESRI 2018), and Hadoop-GIS,
a scalable spatial data warehousing system (Aji et al. 2013). Spatial Hadoop adds
native support for spatial data by supporting a set of spatial index structures and
developing spatial functions that interact directly with Hadoop base code (Yao et al.
2017). Impala, a distributed SQL query engine for Hadoop, has also been extended
for spatial data (Eldawy et al. 2015). Apache Spark’s core in-memory data abstrac-
tion, called a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), outperforms MapReduce-based
approaches. Inefﬁcient handling of interactive operations, the performance bottle-
neck of Hadoop-based tools, is addressed by GeoSpark, which adds support for
spatial data and operations to Spark (Yu et al. 2015). GCMF, an end-to-end software
system on GPGPU, illustrates the potential of GPGPU as a platform for geospatial
information processing, as it can handle spatial joins over non-indexed polygonal
datasets containing more than 600,000 polygons on a single GPU within 8 s (Agha-
jarian et al. 2016).
HPC is also applied in spatial data mining. Examples of HPC for spatial statis-
tics include parallelizing the computation of statistical measures (e.g., Moran’s I and
Getis-Ord) using MPI and OpenMP (Wang et al. 2008; Kazar et al. 2004). Paralleliza-
tion of the interpolation method has also been studied. Parallelized Kriging has been
implemented on both MPI and GPGPU (Pesquer et al. 2011; de Ravé et al. 2014).
Hadoop and Spark have also been leveraged as platforms to implement Kriging and
inverse distance-weighted interpolation algorithms (Xu et al. 2015; Rizki et al. 2017).
Parameter estimation for many spatial statistical models (e.g., spatial autoregression
and space-time kernel density estimation) relies on matrix operations and may beneﬁt
from parallel formulations of linear algebra algorithms. A parallelization of wavelet
transform, which can locate frequency outliers, has been implemented on MPI to
scale up outlier detection algorithms (Barua and Alhajj 2007). Both GPU-based and
OpenMP-based parallel algorithms have been explored for spatial prediction and
classiﬁcation (Gandhi et al. 2006; Rey et al. 2013). Researchers are investigating
the use of GPUs as a platform for computing likelihood ratios as well as Ripley’s K
function (Pang et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2015). GPU-based methods have also been
introduced to accelerate the computation of change detection (Prasad et al. 2013,
2015).

6.2.5
Research Challenges and Future Directions
HPC is essential for handling today’s growing volumes of spatial data and the ever-
increasing size and complexity of geospatial information processing problems. In
addition to the existing methods and tools, further study in two focus areas is neces-
sary to take full advantage of HPC for geospatial information processing.
The ﬁrst focus of study is the parallelization of the currently available methods for
HPC. The ubiquitous existence of spatial autocorrelation makes parallelization not
applicable for most geo-related algorithms because the dependence between data
partitions requires task interaction, which increases the difﬁculty of parallelizing
serial algorithms in spatial database and spatial data mining functions. Additionally,
the load balancing between processing elements is complicated when dealing with
sparse data structures for which the pattern of interaction among data elements is
data-dependent and highly irregular. Spatial networks (e.g., road networks) are an
example of these data structures.
The second focus of study is utilization of geospatial big data to discover novel
problems, patterns, research, and decisions. For example, most current research in
spatial data mining uses Euclidean space, which often assumes isotropic properties
and symmetric neighborhoods. However, the distribution of many spatial phenomena
isstronglyaffectedbytheunderlyingnetworkspace,suchasriversandroadnetworks.
Some cutting-edge research has been conducted to generalize spatial analysis and
data mining methods to the network space, such as network spatial interpolation
(Kriging), network point density estimation, and linear hotspot detection (Okabe and
Sugihara2012).However,moreresearchisneededinthenetworkspace.Forexample,
in addition to the shortest paths, simple paths or irregular subgraphs are potential
candidates for study in linear hotspot detection problems to discover interesting
patterns.
In addition to the network space, the curved surface of the Earth is rarely con-
sidered in the currently available spatial database and data mining functions. For
example, Chap. 2 discusses extending spatial indexing based on a space-ﬁlling curve
and coordinate system to the curved surface. However, another family of spatial
indexing, R-tree, which is the default spatial indexing supported by major DBMSs
such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostGIS, only works in Euclidean space. Additionally,
the deﬁnition of distance on the curved surface of the Earth is different from that in
the Euclidean space, which affects the discovery of spatial patterns such as outliers,
hotspots, and colocation.
Spatial heterogeneity is another topic to be explored. Spatial heterogeneity refers
to the uneven distribution of spatial phenomena within an area. Most of the existing
methods focus on the discovery rules or patterns valid for the whole dataset. However,
the belief that spatial context matters is a major theme in geographic thought (Miller
and Goodchild 2015). Different rules or patterns may exist in various places. If a
pattern is infrequent relative to the size of the whole dataset, it may be missed if the
entire dataset is analyzed. Such localized patterns are easier to ﬁnd in smaller subsets
of the data, around their spatial footprints. Identifying these patterns is challenging

due to the need to enumerate all relevant footprints that may include an exponential
number of data partitions (e.g., subgraphs of a road network). Examples of research
on this topic include the spatial ensemble classiﬁcation method (Jiang et al. 2017)
and study of local colocation pattern detection (Li and Shekhar 2018).
Both the abovementioned future research directions pose new challenges for the
computational capacity of currently available systems and tools. A highly integrated
and reliable infrastructure ecosystem of HPC is required for geospatial information
processing because most existing approaches focus on parallelization of speciﬁc
tasks. Such an infrastructure can be utilized to speed up data management, mining,
andanalysisprojectswithscaleanddatagranularitythatwerepreviouslynotpossible,
and enable new discoveries and ways of planning and decision making with novel
big-data-oriented tools that are unavailable in the standard software.

Web Service-Based Online Geoprocessing
Online geoprocessing refers to the use of spatial analysis functionality (such as buffer,
interpolation and ﬁltering operations) on the web to generate the desired output by
applying a requested operation or chains of operations on input data. For the client-
server interaction to work, clients and servers must be able to exchange requests
and responses, for example, in the form of standardized web services. The stan-
dardization body in the geoinformatics sector is the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/owc). OGC standards are aimed
to provide syntactically interoperable services to facilitate integration, exchange and
reuse of observations, data and geocomputational functions. Current applications
of online geocomputation in the context of Digital Earth demonstrate the beneﬁts
of this standards-based technology. Some examples of such applications as well as
challenges for advancing online geoprocessing for Digital Earth applications are
discussed in Sect. 6.3.3. The alternative to standardized web services is application
programminginterfaces(API)anddataformatssuchasJSON—theJavaScriptObject
Notation, which are increasingly popular (Scheider and Ballatore 2018). However,
the plethora of available APIs limits the reusability of services that is with standard-
ized approaches.
OGC service speciﬁcations cover services for raster or vector data, sensor obser-
vations, processing services, catalog services, and mapping services. The princi-
ple behind these services is that the interfaces are standardized, which means that
resources can be requested following a set of deﬁned parameters via the hypertext
transfer protocol (HTTP). The requests are processed by a server and a response
is sent back to the requesting user or service; the responses are generally encoded
in XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Providers of web services can register
their services in catalogs such that clients can discover and use these services. This

publish-ﬁnd-bind principle is fundamental in service-oriented architectures (SOAs)
that realize the principle of integrating resources from distributed sources. Service-
oriented architectures are commonly used in the context of spatial data infrastructures
and (open) data initiatives, for example, GEOSS (http://www.geoportal.org).
According to Yue et al. (2015) such web services have the potential to become
intelligent, i.e., easing the automated discovery and composition of data and pro-
cessing services to generate the required information at the right time. To realize
this vision, a move from the currently supported syntactic interoperability towards
semantic interoperability is a core requirement (Yue et al. 2015). This section dis-
cusses the state-of-the-art of online geoprocessing in the context of Digital Earth as
well as current lines of research related to semantics of geocomputational functions
and spatial data. The objectives of this section are reﬂected in its structure: Sect. 6.3.2
introduces the principles of two geoprocessing services—the web processing service
(WPS) and the web coverage processing service (WCPS). Section 6.3.3 discusses
the state-of-the-art by reviewing successful applications of geoprocessing technol-
ogy. Some current research trends and future directions to realize intelligent online
geoprocessing are discussed in Sect. 6.3.4.
6.3.2
Web (Coverage) Processing Services
The key technologies for web service-based online processing are web processing
services (WPSs) and web coverage processing services (WCPSs). As their names
suggest, WCPSs provide processing functionality for coverages and is related to the
webcoverageservice(WCS)standard;WPSprovidegeneralprocessingfunctionality
for geospatial data. Both of these services follow the overall design principle of
interoperable OGC web services and are brieﬂy introduced below.
WPSs are currently available in version 2.0. A WPS must support the GetCapa-
bilities, DescribeProcess and Execute requests, which are sent to the server using
the HTTP GET or POST methods or the simple object access protocol (SOAP)
(http://cite.opengeospatial.org/pub/cite/ﬁles/edu/processing/basic-index.html). The
responses of the GetCapabilities and DescribeProcess requests contain information
on parameter values required for an Execute request. These pieces of information
cover the input, parameters and output of processes. Input and output data, which
are either complex or literal data, are speciﬁed with a description and information
on mimeType (e.g., “text/xml”), encoding (e.g., “UTF-8”) and schema (e.g., “http://
schemas.opengis.net/gml/3.2.1/feature.xsd”). It is possible to specify the data types
of literal data as well as allowed values. WPS can be executed in synchronous or
asynchronous modes; asynchronous execution is preferred for calculations that take
longer.
The nature of WPS is generic as the kind of calculation a processing service
provides is not speciﬁed. The generic nature of WPS is said to be one reason for its
slow uptake, as it is difﬁcult for clients to deal with the variety of outputs generated
by different WPSs (Jones et al. 2012). The process implementations are hidden from
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies
203
the users; the information provided on the processes includes their input, output and
parameters as well as a title, description, identiﬁer and additional optional metadata.
To reuse processes, it is essential to have information on what a process does and the
datasets it can be applied to. Thus, process proﬁles have been revised and modiﬁed
to describe the meaning of operations and their inputs and outputs in the WPS 2.0
standard (Müller 2015).
The web coverage processing service is an extension of the WCS standard with
an explicit focus on the processing of coverages, i.e., multidimensional raster data; it
has been available since 2008. The current WCS 2.1 version supports the GetCapa-
bilities, DescribeCoverage and GetCoverage requests. These requests are extended
for the ProcessCoverage request in WCPS. Filter mechanisms that restrict the spa-
tial or temporal extent of the processed data are a core requirement for interaction
with multidimensional coverages. The WCPS provides a speciﬁc syntax, which is
somewhat similar to the structured query language SQL, for formulating queries of
temporal and spatial subsets of data (Baumann 2010). WCS and WCPS can handle
a multitude of different formats of data encodings that are relevant in the context of
image data; these include NetCDF, GeoTiff, JPEG, and GRIB2. A tutorial on WCS
and its extensions is available on Zenodo (Wagemann 2016).
Although WCPS was speciﬁcally designed for coverage data, its reuse across
applications is hindered by diverging deﬁnitions of data models and the heterogeneity
of data formats (Wagemann et al. 2018).
6.3.3
Online Geoprocessing Applications in the Context
of Digital Earth
This section presents three recent examples of application of online geoprocessing.
These applications were published in a related special issue aimed at promoting
online geoprocessing technology for Digital Earth applications (Hofer et al. 2018).
The applications demonstrate the use of web processing services and web coverage
processing services as extensions of existing infrastructures in a variety of contexts.
They derive relevant and timely information from (big) data in efﬁcient and reusable
manner, which serves the objectives of Digital Earth.
Wiemann et al. (2018) focus on the assessment of water body quality based on
the integration of data available in SDIs to date; the data types considered are fea-
ture objects and raster data. Their work introduced a new concept of geoprocessing
patterns that suggest the application of processing functionality based on input data
selected by the user of the application. The motivation behind this development is
to assist users in deriving information from data. Their information system supports
determination of river sinuosity as an indicator of the ecological quality of rivers,
assessment of real estate values potentially affected by ﬂoods, and the discovery of
observations made along rivers.
204
Z. Li et al.
Stasch et al. (2018) present the semiautomatic processing of sensor observations
in the context of water dam monitoring. An existing infrastructure makes sensor
observations such as water levels and GPS measurements of dam structure available
and the objective of their work is to statistically analyze the observations and use
them as model inputs. Their motivation to use WPS is related to the possible reuse of
services and ﬂexibility regarding the integration of sensor observations from other
sources in the ﬁnal decision making. The coupling of sensor observation services
(SOSs) with WPS is not a standard use case. Therefore, Stasch et al. (2018) dis-
cuss various approaches of coupling SOSs and WPS and selected a tight coupling
approach in which a processing service can directly request observations from an
SOS, which reduces overhead in communication. The authors also developed a REST
API for WPS to reduce the required parsing of extensive XML ﬁles and ease client
development; they provided the speciﬁcation of a REST binding, which is lacking
in the current WPS 2.0 standard.
Wagemann et al. (2018) present examples of the application of web coverage
processing services in the context of big Earth data. They show how online geopro-
cessing supports the derivation of value-added products from data collections and
how this technology transforms workﬂows. They state that server-side data process-
ing can overcome issues using different solutions for data access and can minimize
the amount of data transported on the web (Wagemann et al. 2018). They described
examples of the application of WCPS in the domains of ocean science, Earth obser-
vation, climate science and planetary science; all of the examples use the rasdaman
server technology. One of the presented applications for marine sciences provides
a visual interface where a coverage of interest such as monthly values of chloro-
phyll concentration that were derived from ocean color satellite data can be speciﬁed
(http://earthserver.pml.ac.uk/www). The provided coverage data can be compared
with in situ measurements via a match-up tool. The match-up is calculated on the
server and the users are presented with the results without having to download the
chlorophylldatatotheirmachines.Theproviderofthisservicemustoffertherequired
computing resources and the limitation of requests to a certain data volume is a known
issue (Wagemann et al. 2018).
6.3.4
Research Challenges and Future Directions
Online geoprocessing technology has been improved over the last decade and the
applications demonstrate its usability in real-world use cases. The potential of stan-
dardized web services lies in the ﬂexible integration and reuse of services and compu-
tational power from different providers. However, in addition to the costs of service
provision to potential clients, the complexity and opacity of geoprocessing work-
ﬂows seem to hinder their mass usage. This is indicated by the fact that mapping
services and data services are much more widely spread than processing services
(Lopez-Pellicer et al. 2012). The reasons for this are manifold and relate to the vari-
ety of data models and formats, which limits the applicability of existing processing
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies
205
services (Wagemann et al. 2018), lacking descriptions of processing services such as
those approached with WPS process proﬁles (Müller 2015) and the required transfer
of potentially large data from a data provider to a service provider.
Assuming that geoprocessing services are available for reuse across applications,
the most relevant current challenges concern the opacity of service, data and tool
interfaces, and the corresponding lack of clarity about when a geocomputational
service is potentially useful. Applying a geocomputational function is a matter of
analytic purpose as well as of the properties of the data sources used. The latter
goes well beyond data types and necessarily involves background knowledge about
the semantics of spatial data (Hofer et al. 2017; Scheider et al. 2016). Thus, it was
recognized early in the ﬁeld of geocomputation that, in addition to syntactic inter-
operability (i.e., the matching of formats and data types), semantic interoperability
must be taken into account (Ouksel and Sheth 1999; Bishr 1998). Since then, many
attempts have been made to incorporate semantics into service descriptions, e.g.,
in the form of Datalog rules and types that restrict the application of geocompu-
tational functions (Fitzner et al. 2011; Klien et al. 2006). The technology evolved
as a particular (service-oriented) strand of the semantic web, starting in 2000 (Lara
et al. 2004) and resulting in standards such as the semantic markup for web services
(OWL-S) (https://www.w3.org/Submission/OWL-S/) and web service modeling lan-
guage (WSML) (http://www.wsmo.org/).
Researchers of semantic web services have shown that service descriptions and
Semantic Web technology can be effectively combined and that abstracting from
particular implementations of geocomputational functions remains very difﬁcult
(Treiblmayr et al. 2012). Which aspects of such a function are mere technicalities?
Which aspects are essential and thus should be represented on the semantic level
of the service and data? More generally, what does a reusable representation that is
valid across implementation speciﬁc details look like (Hofer et al. 2017)? The lack of
a good answer to these questions in semantic web service research, e.g., in terms of a
reusable service ontology, may be the reason why semantic web processing services
have become less of a focus in research today. Drawing a line between semantic
and syntactic interoperability is not straightforward, and different and incompatible
“ontological” views on the world must be acknowledged (Scheider and Kuhn 2015).
The need to infuse and reuse such ﬂexible semantics in the age of big data has not
lessened and is more urgent than ever (Janowicz et al. 2014; Scheider et al. 2017).
We currently lack reusable representations of the different views that make geo-
processing operations and data sources useful for a speciﬁc purpose. We also lack
neat theories that tell us which concepts and aspects should be retained to describe
data and geocomputational functions from the practical viewpoint of data analysis.
Ontology design patterns have been proposed as a means to create such representa-
tions (Gangemi and Presutti 2009) and have recently gained popularity. Furthermore,
it is an open question how geocomputational functions relate to the purposes of anal-
ysis. Finally, we need computational methods that allow for us to infuse the needed
background knowledge into service and data descriptions to enable publishing and
exploiting it.
206
Z. Li et al.
Current research on semantic issues in geoprocessing tackles these challenges to
support spatial analyses. We summarize three main lines of research that have evolved
in recent years that may be promising for progress on a semantically interoperable
Digital Earth:
6.3.4.1
Service Metadata, Computational Core Concepts, Linked Data
and Automated Typing
In the current web processing service standards, to reuse a service it is necessary to
describe the capabilities of the service and the service parameters (including data
sources) in terms of metadata. However, the current metadata standards do not specify
howtodothis.Itremainsunclearwhichlanguageandconceptsshouldbeusedinthese
descriptions; it is also unclear how these concepts can be shared across communities
of practice and how they can be automatically added without manual intervention.
Regarding the ﬁrst problem, several recent investigations attempted to identify a
necessary and sufﬁcient set of “core” concepts of spatial information (Kuhn 2012;
Kuhn and Ballatore 2015; Scheider et al. 2016), which remain to be tested in diverse
practical analytical settings. Regarding the second problem, linked open data (LOD)
provides a way to remove the distinction between metadata and data, enabling us to
publish, share and query data and its descriptions at the same time (Kuhn et al. 2014).
Similarly, Brauner (2015) investigated the possibilities of describing and reusing
geooperators with linked data tags on the web, and Hofer et al. (2017) discussed how
such geooperator descriptions can be used for workﬂow development. Regarding
the third problem, it has long been recognized that semantic labeling is a central
automation task for the semantic web, as users tend to avoid the extra manual work
involved. For this purpose, it has been suggested that the provenance information
contained in workﬂows can be used to add semantic labels to the nodes in such a
workﬂow (Alper et al. 2014). For the geospatial domain, it was demonstrated that
the information contained in GIS workﬂows can be used to enrich geodata as well
as GIS tools with important semantic types by traversing such a workﬂow, and share
this information as linked data (Scheider and Ballatore 2018). Furthermore, certain
semantic concepts such as the distinction between extensive and intensive attributes,
which is central for geocomputation and cartography, can be automatically added as
labels using machine learning classiﬁers (Scheider and Huisjes 2019).
6.3.4.2
From Service Chaining to Automated Workﬂow Composition
Automated service chaining has been a scientiﬁc goal and research topic since the
start of the development of semantic web services (Rao and Su 2005). Ontologies are
used to describe the restrictions on input and output types, which can be exploited
by service chaining algorithms to suggest syntactically valid workﬂows. This idea
has also been adopted for the geospatial domain (Yue et al. 2007), where the onto-
logical concepts were mainly based on geodata types. However, in the wider area
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies
207
of workﬂow composition (Gil 2007; Naujokat et al. 2012), ﬁnding efﬁcient com-
position algorithms is not the issue, ﬁnding the relevant semantic constraints that
render the problem tractable is. Once such constraints are found, it is much eas-
ier to devise an algorithm that makes service composition computable for practical
purpose, and it becomes possible to ﬁlter out syntactically valid but nonmeaningful
workﬂows that are currently clogging the workﬂow composition ﬂows (Lamprecht
2013). Thus, similar to the metadata challenge discussed above, scientiﬁc progress
largely depends on whether we will be able to devise a set of reusable valid semantic
concepts for both geocomputation and geodata. In the future, it would be valuable
to measure the effectiveness of spatial semantic concepts in reducing computational
time and increasing accuracy in automated GIS workﬂow composition.
6.3.4.3
From Geocomputation to (Indirect) Question Answering
Since the application of geocomputational tools and the chaining of services require
lots of background knowledge and GIS skills, their usage is currently restricted to GIS
experts. However, those with little or no technical expertise in this area would beneﬁt
most, as well as those with a relevant spatial question about Digital Earth. How can
Digital Earth technology help such users answer their questions? Question-based
spatial computation was proposed as a research topic by Vahedi et al. (2016) and
Gao and Goodchild (2013). The question-answering (QA) computational technique
has been investigated during the last two decades from the information retrieval
perspective (Lin 2002). Standard QA technology parses a natural language question
and matches it with answers available in a database or the web. Recently, linked data-
based data cubes were proposed as a way to realize question answering on a web scale
(Höffner et al. 2016). However, question answering for geocomputation and analysis
requires handling questions that do not yet have an answer but could be answered
using appropriate tools and data. The latter problem was therefore termed indirect
question answering by Scheider et al. (2017). A semantically informed retrieval
portal that can answer such questions should be able expand a data query in a way
that encompasses data sets that do not directly answer a given query but can be made
to do so via appropriate analysis steps. For this purpose, geocomputational tools and
datasets need to be described by the questions they answer, so that they can match
the questions posed by a user. A recent ﬁrst step in developing such a system for a set
of common GIS tools was made based on SPARQL query matching (Scheider et al.
2019), following the idea of query matching for service descriptions proposed by
Fitzner et al. (2011). However, similar to the previous two computational challenges,
the kinds of questions and the matching language and technology are dependent on
our theories of spatial (interrogative) concepts used to formulate these questions. In
the future, we should investigate what kinds of spatial questions are relevant and how
they can be formally captured in terms of core concepts. For related work, refer to the
ERC-funded project QuAnGIS: Question-based analysis of geographic information
with semantic queries (https://questionbasedanalysis.com).

Distributed Geospatial Information Processing
6.4.1
The Concept of Distributed Geospatial Information
Processing: What and Why
Distributed geospatial information processing (DGIP) (Yang et al. 2008; Friis-
Christensen et al. 2009) refers to geospatial information processing (geoprocessing
for short) in a distributed computing environment (DCE). With the development
of the Internet and world wide web, architecture modes of software have changed
dramatically. Decentralization and cross-domain collaboration under a loosely cou-
pled and dynamically changed DCE has become an emerging trend. Adoption of
service-oriented architecture (SOA) and cloud computing is a promising and preva-
lent solution for modern enterprises to enhance and rebuild their cyberinfrastructure.
Using these technologies, it is more agile and much easier to build cooperation net-
works and adjust cross-enterprise business workﬂows dynamically.
Following this trend, geographical information systems (GISystems) are also
experiencing an evolution from traditional stand-alone toolkits to web service-based
ecosystems (Gong et al. 2012), e.g., the geospatial service web (GSW). The GSW
is a conceptual framework for a loosely coupled geospatial collaboration network
through which the end users can share and exchange geospatial resources and con-
duct geoprocessing online by using distributed geographical information services
(GIServices). In the GSW, everything is encapsulated as a service (XaaS), as shown
in Fig. 6.3, including computing resources (CPU, memory, storage and network,
etc.), geospatial data, models, algorithms and knowledge. The wide adoption of the
enabling technologies such as web services, SOA and cloud computing make such a
distributed geospatial collaboration network possible but there are also challenges.
One of the major challenges is how to guarantee the reliability of geoprocessing in
a mutable DCE (Gong et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2015). Traditionally, geoprocessing is
conducted on a single machine with a stand-alone GISystem toolkit installed. Since
the functional components of a GISystem are tightly coupled, it is relatively easy to
capture and handle geoprocessing exceptions and ensure the whole geoprocessing
process, e.g., a workﬂow synthesized with coordinate transformation, buffering and
overlay operations. In comparison, in a DCE, it is complicated to deﬁne, coordinate
and guarantee such a process due to the complexities in data transmission, workﬂow
control and exception handling.
Therefore, DGIP has become a research hotspot as well as an application trend
(Yang et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2017). In this section, we introduce
the basic concept and key techniques of DGIP, and demonstrate its applications in
Digital Earth. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and future directions.

Fundamental Concepts and Techniques
6.4.2.1
Collaboration Mode (Orchestration vs. Choreography)
For a distributed workﬂow to operate appropriately, the coordination and controlling
mechanism is critical. In an SOA context, there are two basic collaboration modes
(Peltz 2003), choreography and orchestration, based on the control ﬂow patterns and
how messages are exchanged, as illustrated in Fig. 6.4.
Web service orchestration (WSO) employs a centralized approach for service
composition. A workﬂow is represented by a centralized coordinator that coordi-
nates the interaction among different services. The coordinator or so-called compos-
ite service is responsible for invoking service partners, manipulating and dispatch
messages. The relationships between the participating services are maintained by the
coordinator. Since WSO adopts a hierarchical requester and responder model, it is
process-centralized and the cooperation among participating services is weakened.
The participating services do not need to know about each other in collaboration.
In WSO, the status maintenance and error handling are relatively easier since it
can be monitored and controlled by the coordinator. When an exception occurs, the
coordinator can trigger exception handling or a compensation mechanism before the
workﬂow progresses into the next step.
In comparison, web service choreography (WSC) adopts a decentralized peer-to-
peer model. There is no a centralized compose service acting as the coordinator to

Fig. 6.4 Architectures of web service orchestration and web service choreography
control participating services, which makes it much more loosely coupled. The whole
workﬂow is deﬁned by exchanging messages, rules of interaction and agreements
between services. Each participating service knows when and how to interact with
each other, as well as whom to interact with, i.e., it is self-described and highly
autonomous. One side effect is that it is difﬁcult to detect errors in a timely manner
and conduct exception handling from the workﬂow perspective. However, it can
avoid the performance bottleneck problem for the coordinator in message exchange
and data transmission.
In summary, the WSC describes the interactions between multiple services from a
global view whereas WSO deﬁnes control from one party’s perspective, and the con-
trol logic of the interactions between services is explicitly modeled in the composite
service (Peltz 2003). Therefore, WSO is generally an intraorganization workﬂow
modeling solution whereas WSC is more suitable for interorganizational or cross-
domain workﬂow modeling when it is difﬁcult to set up a centralized coordinator
across the boundary of management.
Learning from service composition in the IT domain, the geospatial domain pro-
posed the concept of a geospatial service chain, which is deﬁned as a model for com-
bining services in a dependent series to achieve larger tasks for supporting DGIP.
According to the deﬁnition of international standard ISO 19119 (2002), there are
three types of architecture patterns to implement a service chain, as illustrated in
Fig. 6.5, by giving different controlling authorities to clients (Alameh 2003; ISO
19119 2002), i.e., user-deﬁned chaining, workﬂow-managed chaining and aggre-
gated chaining.
• In user-deﬁned (transparent) chaining, the client deﬁnes and controls the entire
workﬂow. In this case, the client discovers and evaluates the ﬁtness of available
services by querying a catalog service, which gives most freedom to the client to
make the control decision and ask for workﬂow modeling knowledge.
• In workﬂow-managed (translucent) chaining, the workﬂow management service
controls the service chain and the client is aware of the participating services. In

this mode, the client can check the execution status of individual participating
services, and the workload on workﬂow control is reduced.
• In aggregated service (opaque) chaining, the client invokes a compose service
without awareness of the individual participating services. The compose service
manages all the details of chain execution.
Although ISO 19119 gives the architecture patterns of service chaining, there is no
de facto domain-speciﬁc standard on modeling language. The modeling languages of
web service composition introduced in the next section use service chain modeling
as a reference.
6.4.2.2
Workﬂow Modeling Language
A formalized model description language is desired to allow for a service chain
be understood and shared among heterogeneous systems. Computer-aided business
process management (BPM) has been widely used in modern enterprises for decades.
Due to the variety of the backend IT enabling technologies and application scenarios,
therearehundredsofworkﬂowlanguagesdevelopedbydifferentcommunities.These
languages have different capabilities for ﬂow rule expression (Aalst et al. 2003). In
general, the languages can be classiﬁed into industrial speciﬁcations and academic
models (Beek et al. 2007).
Industrial workﬂow speciﬁcations are model languages that target a certain tech-
nique implementation, and are widely supported by companies and standardiza-
tion organizations. Web services business process execution language (WS-BPEL)
and web service choreography description language (WSCDL) are two workﬂow
standards specialized for web service composition. There are many open-source
and commercial toolkits for reliable workﬂow modeling and execution management
based on these speciﬁcations. However, these speciﬁcations are usually mixed with
lower-level techniques such as XML encoding, XQuery, SOAP, WSDL and WS-
addressing. These technical details increase the learning curve for users that lack
or have little background knowledge of programming and web service standards.
Workﬂow Management Coalition (WfMC) created an XML-based process deﬁnition
language (XPDL) to store and exchange workﬂow models deﬁned by different mod-
eling language that is independent of concrete implementation techniques. XPDL is
considered one of the best solutions to formally describe workﬂow diagrams deﬁned
using business process modeling notation (BPMN).
Academic workﬂow models express abstract process structures and rules that are
not bound by a concrete runtime environment, lower-level implementation details
and protocols (Beek et al. 2007; Gui et al. 2008), e.g., automata and process algebras.
Directed graph and mathematical notations are widely used for workﬂow descrip-
tion, e.g., Petri nets (Hamadi and Benatallah 2003). Academic workﬂow models
can express abstract process knowledge and have strict mathematical logics for pro-
cess validation. However, these models are less used in industrial environments, and
software to support workﬂow modeling and runtime management is lacking.

Fig. 6.6 A multistage geospatial service chaining process
In terms of geospatial service chaining, there is no well-accepted model language
and domain-speciﬁc modeling methods should be developed. The European Space
Agency (ESA) adopted WS-BEPL and established a service partner network to sup-
port global collaboration on earth observation. WS-BPEL is a de facto and widely
used standard of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
Standards (OASIS) derived from the combination of IBM’s Web Services Flow
Language (WSFL) and Microsoft’s notation language for business process design
(XLANG). However, the lower-level technique details in WS-BPEL may be beyond
the expertise of domain experts without web service knowledge. WS-BPEL adopts
static binding to specify service partners and communication rules in advance and
makes it difﬁcult to adopt a dynamic and mutable environment. Therefore, a multi-
stage geospatial service chaining method is highly desired to separate abstract geo-
processing workﬂow knowledge and lower-level implementation details, and make
service partner binding dynamic, as illustrated in Fig. 6.6.
As shown in Fig. 6.6, Di et al. (2006) divided geospatial service chaining process
into three steps, geoprocessing modeling, geoprocessing model instantiation and
workﬂow execution. In the processing modeling stage, geoscience domain experts
use a logical model language to depict abstract geoprocessing workﬂows based on
process knowledge. In the process model instantiation stage, the logical model is
mapped into a physical model that binds with implementation details. The data
sources of the input data and service instances of participating services are speciﬁed
during instantiation. Then, the physical model can be deployed into a workﬂow
engine for workﬂow execution and runtime management.

Development of Geospatial Workﬂow Modeling Languages
and Tools
Based on the concept of multistage geospatial service chaining, various model lan-
guages have been proposed and modeling platforms have been developed. Chen et al.
(2009) deﬁned a geospatial abstract information model (AIM) language to describe
logical models, which can be considered a new virtual geospatial product for process
214
Z. Li et al.
knowledge sharing and reuse. A logical model has a directed graph expression as
well as an XML presentation that can be instantiated and translated into an executable
WS-BPEL model for reliable execution management. By adopting such technolo-
gies, Di (2004) developed GeoBrain, a geospatial knowledge building system based
on web service technologies, to automate data discovery and facilitate geoprocessing
workﬂow modeling. Gui et al. (2008) also proposed an abstract geospatial service
chain model language, DDBASCM, by combining data-dependency directed graph
and block structures. In DDBASCM, the data ﬂow is represented using a directed
graph structure, and the control ﬂow and aggregated service are depicted as block
structures by learning from the concept of a transition-bordered set in Petri Net.
Based on DDBASCM and WS-BPEL, a geospatial web service chain visual mod-
eling and execution platform called GeoChaining was developed, which integrates
catalog-based geospatial resource searching, service chain visual modeling, execu-
tion status monitoring and data visualization (Wu et al. 2011, 2014). Sun et al. (2012)
developed a task-oriented geoprocessing system called GeoPWTManager to design,
execute, monitor and visualize the workﬂow. In GeoPWTManager, the entire mod-
eling and execution process is ensured by the collaboration of three components,
i.e., a task designer, a task executor and a task monitor. Based on GeoPWTManager,
GeoJModelBuilder, an open source geoprocessing workﬂow tool, was developed by
leveraging open standard, sensor web, geoprocessing service and OpenMI-compliant
models (Jiang et al. 2017).
Although implementation technologies are continuously evolving and new tools
will be developed, the demand for development of a domain-speciﬁc workﬂow mod-
eling language that can explicitly describe the terminologies and geoprocessing
knowledge in the geospatial domain is still high. Cloud-based services that inte-
grate online resource discovery, visualization, automatic/semiautomatic modeling,
model sharing and reuse will be a trend to facilitate DGIP workﬂow modeling and
execution management.
6.4.3.2
Digital Earth Applications
Geospatial service chaining provides an agile and loosely coupled approach to
arrange the cooperation of dispersed GIServices to achieve DGIP. Based on the
aforementioned technologies and platforms, DGIP-supported earth science applica-
tions have been developed. For example, the ESA created a net primary productivity
(NPP) workﬂow in its online collaboration platform, Service Support Environment
(SSE), for repeatable estimates of the net ﬂux of carbon over user-speciﬁed AOI areas
using SPOT vegetation S10 data. There are also more than 30 DGIP workﬂow-based
applications provided by 23 service partners from 10 countries, including for oil
spill detection, ﬁre risk, Kyoto protocol veriﬁcation, desert locusts, land use, snow
cover, tidal currents, and multiple catalog access. In GeoBrain, many DGIP work-
ﬂow models have been developed based on the proposed logical modeling language.
A landslide susceptibility model (Chen et al. 2009) that integrates terrain slope and
aspect analysis services as well as landslide susceptibility analysis services has been
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies
215
used to analyze landslide susceptibility in California, USA. GeoChaining (Wu et al.
2014) also provides workﬂow models by integrating third-party developed GISer-
vices such as OpenRS (Guo et al. 2010) and GIServices developed by encapsulating
the open-source GIS tool GRASS (https://grass.osgeo.org). A ﬂood analysis model
was developed to analyze ﬂooding in the Boyang Lake area using remote sensing
data before a ﬂood, during ﬂooding and after ﬂooding. By developing web-based
human-computer interaction interfaces using Rich Internet Application (RIA) tech-
nologies, workﬂow models involving human participation have also been developed
in GeoSquare for educational and research purposes (Wu et al. 2015; Yang et al.
2016), including remote sensing image geometrical rectiﬁcation and classiﬁcation.
Through integration with NASA world wind, GeoJModelBuilder (Jiang et al. 2017)
also provides many hydrological models such as for water turbidity, watershed runoff,
and drainage extraction.
In addition to applications comprised of geospatial service chaining, there are
other forms of DGIP. For example, volunteer computing (VC) is a type of distributed
computing that incorporates volunteered computing resources from individual per-
sons and organizations. The VC usually adopts middleware architecture contain-
ing a client program that is installed and running on volunteer computers. VC has
been successfully applied to many scientiﬁc research projects such as SETI@home
(https://setiathome.berkeley.edu) and Folding@home(https://foldingathome.org). In
the earth science domain, NASA launched a VC project named Climate@home to
create a virtual supercomputer to model global climate research. This project utilizes
worldwide computing resources to establish accuracy models for climate change
prediction (Li et al. 2013).
Various applications have been developed, and the potential application scenar-
ios are unlimited. As more GIServices for geoprocessing and big data analysis are
developed using cloud computing and VC technologies, more interdisciplinary appli-
cations in earth science and social science will be developed.
6.4.4
Research Challenges and Future Directions
6.4.4.1
Communication Mechanism and Code Migration
Optimized network communication is critical for efﬁcient and reliable DGIP because
it relies on network communication for data transmission and service collaboration.
The simple object access protocol (SOAP) is a widely used messaging protocol for
exchanging information and conducting remote procedure calls (RPCs) in DCE using
multiple lower-level transportation protocols such as HTTP, SMTP and TCP. SOAP
is extensible to support functions such as security, message routing and reliability
by compositing with web service speciﬁcations. SOAP supports multiple message
exchange patterns (MEPs) such as one-way messages, request/respond mode and
asynchronous messages. However, SOAP is not efﬁcient in encoding due to its XML-
based hierarchical envelope structure, for example, when transmitting vector data
216
Z. Li et al.
represented in GML or a raster image formatted using base64 binary encoding. As a
result, SOAP message transmission optimization technologies have been developed.
Binary data code can be sent as multipart MIME documents in SOAP attachments,
and XML-binary Optimized Packages (XOP) provide a reliable approach to refer
external data in the SOAP messaging, as proposed in SOAP standard version 1.2.
The development of HTTP Representational State Transfer (RESTful) (Fielding
2000) brings new challenges for DGIP. The RESTful architecture style has been
widely adopted in web application development (Pautasso et al. 2008). OGC GISer-
vice standards use RESTful APIs as the major interoperating approach. Considering
this trend, service composition technologies and tools should support RESTful ser-
vices. Compared with SOAP, RESTful is lightweight and stateless, but the security,
routing and reliable message transmission are weakened. Therefore, making DGIP
reliable and secure has become critically important. Robust ﬂow control, exception
handling and compensation mechanisms must be developed for both the workﬂow
engine and the participating services.
Communication issues have also inspired new ideas and research directions. Geo-
processing usually involves a large data volume and intensive geo-computation. The
intensive data transmission increases the workload of the network infrastructure, as
well as those of the participating services and workﬂow coordinator, and makes time
efﬁciency a troublesome issue. To improve the user experience for DGIP, an asyn-
chronous execution status-tracking method has been developed (Wu et al. 2014).
Version 2.0 of the OGC web processing service (WPS) standard ofﬁcially supports
asynchronousexecutionofgeoprocessingbytheconjunctionofGetStatus andGetRe-
sult operations. The GetStatus operation provides status information of a processing
job for query, and GetResult allows for the client to query the result of a processing
job. Through an asynchronous mechanism, a geoprocessing workﬂow engine can
actively and instantly push the latest execution status of dispersed services to clients.
Data transmission may also introduce data security risks, especially for classiﬁed or
sensitive data. As the volume of software programs may be much smaller than the
data volume, researchers proposed the idea of code migration. However, it is not easy
to migrate code in heterogeneous systems due to the complex dependency of software
packages. VC provides an alternative solution by installing a speciﬁed client to set up
a uniﬁed runtime environment, e.g., BOINC (https://boinc.berkeley.edu). This prob-
lem is eliminated in a clustered computing environment because the computing nodes
are equipped with the same operating system and distributed computing framework
and thus the code can be migrated smoothly. For example, the high-performance
frameworks introduced in Sect. 6.2, e.g., Apache Hadoop and Spark, migrate codes
to computing nodes according to the locality of the dataset in the distributed ﬁle
system to avoid IO overhead and optimize computing performance.
6.4.4.2
Quality-Aware Service Chain Instantiation
As global providers deliver more GIServices with similar functions but diverse qual-
ity, it has become challenging to select appropriate service instances from similar
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies
217
service candidates. To enable quality-aware service chain instantiation, quality eval-
uation methods and mathematical planning methods must be developed (Hu et al.
2019b). Quality evaluation assesses the ﬁtness of individual participating services or
aggregated services according to user quality requirements, and mathematical plan-
ning assists the service instance selection for each individual participating service
by considering the overall quality of the service chain.
Multiple quality dimensions such as time efﬁciency and reliability must be lever-
aged to evaluate the quality of a participating service. Operations research methods
such as multiple attribute decision making (MADM) and the analytic hierarchy pro-
cess (AHP) provide solutions for quality dimension integration (Zeng et al. 2003).
However, the control-ﬂow and data-ﬂow structures must be considered to determine
the aggregated quality of a service chain (Jaeger et al. 2004).
In terms of service chaining, quality metrics have different aggregation behaviors
under different ﬂow structures (Aalst et al. 2003). For example, the total response
time of a service chain with a sequential control-ﬂow structure is the sum of the
response times of all the participating services, and the total reliability is calculated
by multiplying the availability of all the participating services. Quality computation
can be more complicated in service chains with nested ﬂow structures. If only the
quality status of participating services is considered and the workﬂow structure is
ignored, then the overall optimization of a service chain cannot be guaranteed (Jaeger
et al. 2004; Gui et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2019a, b), especially when multiple quality
metrics must be balanced.
Tosupportquality-awaregeospatialservicechaininstantiation,sophisticatedGIS-
ervice selection methods must be developed. Mathematical programming approaches
such as Linear Programming (LP) can be used in service chains (Zeng et al. 2003;
Gui et al. 2009) with a limited number of participating services. When the scale of
the service chain increases, these methods become less efﬁcient due the computing
complexity. Furthermore, LP can only provide one optimized solution in the planning
stage, which may not be optimal when one of the quality metrics slightly changes,
since service runtime and network environments are typically mutable. Evolutionary
methods (Canfora et al. 2005) such as genetic algorithms and swarm intelligent algo-
rithms provide strong search capabilities and robustness in dynamic situations (Jula
et al. 2014) and can be applied for geospatial service chain optimization. Consider-
ing the nature of complex ﬂow structures and high dimensions of the quality metrics
of a geospatial service chain, more research on quality evaluation and GIService
selection must be conducted.
6.4.4.3
Semantic-Aided Automatic Service Chaining
With the development of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and semantic web technologies,
automatic service chaining has been a research hotspot for many years and is still
evolving. The goal of automatic service chaining is to make the computer capable
of discovering web service resources and automatically building the service chain
218
Z. Li et al.
according to the requirements and constraints of the end user. In contrast to quality-
aware service chain instantiation, there is no logical model available in advance
for automatic service chaining. Thus, the computer must build the logical chain and
instantiate it upon domain knowledge and the timeliness of the service resources, i.e.,
whether the service instance or data provider is available or not. To achieve this goal,
a formal description of knowledge is required. The development of semantic web,
ontology web language (OWL) and domain ontologies facilitates GIService semantic
markups. For example, ontology-based description languages and rule languages are
used for semantic discovery and geospatial service chaining (Lutz and Klien 2006;
Yue et al. 2009), including semantic markup for web services (OWL-S), web service
modeling ontology (WSMO), description logics (DL) and ﬁrst-order logic (FOL).
GeoBrain provides a web-based semiautomatic chaining environment by allowing
for end-users to participate in human-computer interaction during the backwards rea-
soning (Di 2004; Han et al. 2011). The degree of suitability for candidate workﬂows
is calculated by using the semantic similarity to support semiautomatic chaining
(Hobona et al. 2007).
Semantic-aided chaining approaches have been developed and veriﬁed in lab-
oratory environments; however, more research must be conducted to make them
feasible in real-world applications. Currently, semantic markups for describing con-
tent, functions or prerequisites lack in most online-accessible geospatial resources. In
addition, spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) and geoportals such as GEOSS clearing-
house, Data.gov, and INSPIRE do not provide semantic-aware discovery functions.
The challenges include determining how to provide a semantic-enabled metadata
Registry Information Model (RIM) for GIService semantic description, retrieval and
validation (Qi et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2017). W3C semantic standards such as the
resource description framework (RDF) and OWL-S provide promising solutions for
describing domain knowledge, enabling intelligent and efﬁcient service discovery.
However, these semantic languages must be linked with existing metadata standards
in global SDIs (Gui et al. 2013). From the chain modeling perspective, AI reason-
ing technologies require further development to enable automatic and intelligent
chaining. The rapid development of knowledge graph and mining technologies may
provide a potential solution, which has been widely adopted in domain knowledge
modeling and reasoning (Lin et al. 2015). Furthermore, to conduct DGIP-supported
geoscience data analysis using heterogeneous Earth observation and socioeconomic
data, we need to establish and advocate for standardization of the Discrete Global
Grid System (DGGS) (Mahdavi-Amiri et al. 2015). It is critically important to pro-
mote heterogeneous earth science data fusion and interoperability, and the related
standards and data models should be integrated into global SDIs (Purss et al. 2017).

Discussion and Conclusion
Geospatial information processing and computing technologies are essential for Dig-
ital Earth, as they enable various Digital Earth applications by turning geospatial
6
Geospatial Information Processing Technologies
219
data into information and knowledge. By identifying the challenges of geospatial
data manipulation in the big data era, including massive volume, heterogeneous, and
distributed, this chapter introduced three population technologies for geospatial data
processing: high-performance computing, online geoprocessing, and distributed geo-
processing. Each of the three technologies focuses on addressing a speciﬁc challenge,
though there are some overlaps. High-performance computing primarily deals with
the volume challenge by solving data- and computing-intensive problems in paral-
lel. Online geoprocessing tackles the heterogeneous challenge through standardized
and interoperable geospatial web services and web APIs. Distributed geoprocessing
addresses the distributed challenge by processing geospatial data and information in
a distributed computing environment. The fundamental concepts, principles, and key
techniques of the three technologies were elaborated in detail. Application examples
in the context of Digital Earth were also provided to demonstrate how each technol-
ogy has been used to support geospatial information processing. Although the three
technologies are relatively mature and have a broad range of applications, research
challenges have been identiﬁed and future research directions are envisioned for each
technology to better support Digital Earth.
For high-performance computing (Sect. 6.2), one research challenge and direc-
tion is to continue the efforts to parallelize existing serial algorithms in spatial
database and spatial data mining functions considering the dependence and inter-
actions between data and problem partitions. Another direction is to develop new
parallel algorithms to mine geospatial big data in the network space instead of in
Euclidean space, as many spatial processes and interactions often occur in the net-
work space. The third direction is to explore new and efﬁcient computing methods
to identify patterns from massive volumes of geospatial data considering the spa-
tial heterogeneity. For online geoprocessing (Sect. 6.3), the main challenge is the
lack of opacity in the services, data, and tool interfaces. This hinders the interop-
erability among the diverse services and creates a challenge when a problem needs
to be solved by processing multi-sourced data using different services and tools.
One promising solution is to incorporate semantics into web services to increase the
interoperability among heterogeneous resources. In semantic web service research,
three research directions are envisioned to achieve a semantically interoperable and
intelligent Digital Earth: linked data and automated typing, automated workﬂow
composition, and question answering. For distributed geoprocessing (Sect. 6.4), one
challenge arises from reliability and security concerns. More efforts are needed to
ensure a reliable and secure distributed computing environment considering aspects
of the ﬂow control, exception handling, compensation mechanism, and quality-aware
service chains. The large volumes of geospatial data also lead to challenges in mov-
ing distributed data to the processing tools/services. Although moving code to data
(code migration) is a promising solution, further research is needed to migrate code
among the heterogeneous systems due to the complex dependency of software pack-
ages. In addition, more efforts are needed to move semantic-aided automatic service
chaining techniques from the laboratory environment to real-world applications.
Lastly, the Digital Earth reference framework (Fig. 6.1) aims to integrate heteroge-
neous data sources with a harmonious high-level data model of the Earth so that data
220
Z. Li et al.
can be handled seamlessly with different tools, protocols, technologies. Currently,
most of the tools use the framework of traditional coordinate systems such as the
geographic coordinate system based on the continuous latitude and longitude or the
projected coordinate system that projects the curved Earth surface to a ﬂat surface.
Although the traditional coordinate systems have been successful, another reference
framework called the discrete global grid system (DGGS, see Chap. 2 Digital Earth
Platforms for more details) is considered better for data associated with the curved
heterogeneous surface of the Earth (Sabeur et al. 2019). We believe that the DGGS
will play an increasingly important role in geospatial information processing in the
big data era because (1) the DGGS provides a single and relatively simple framework
for the seamless integration of heterogeneous distributed global geospatial data from
different sources and domains; (2) the DGGS works with high-performance com-
puting to handle big data extremely well because data managed with the DGGS is
already decomposed into discrete domains and can be processed in parallel; and (3)
by providing a single framework, the DGGS beneﬁts interoperability among dif-
ferent tools and geoprocessing technologies and is a promising solution to build a
semantically interoperable Digital Earth. However, most available analysis tools are
designed to work with the traditional reference framework. Thus, more efforts are
needed to design and develop storage mechanisms, spatiotemporal indexes, com-
puting algorithms, and big data computing platforms that are compatible with the
DGGS framework.

Abstract In this chapter, we review and summarize the current state of the art in
geovisualization and extended reality (i.e., virtual, augmented and mixed reality),
covering a wide range of approaches to these subjects in domains that are related
to geographic information science. We introduce the relationship between geovisu-
alization, extended reality and Digital Earth, provide some fundamental deﬁnitions
of related terms, and discuss the introduced topics from a human-centric perspec-
tive. We describe related research areas including geovisual analytics and movement
visualization, both of which have attracted wide interest from multidisciplinary com-
munities in recent years. The last few sections describe the current progress in the

Introduction
A future, fully functional Digital Earth is essentially what we understand as a
(geo)virtual reality environment today: A multisensory simulation of the Earth as-is
and how it could be, so we can explore it holistically, with its past, present, and
future made available to us in any simulated form we wish (Gore 1998; Grossner
et al. 2008). The concept of Digital Earth can be associated with the emergence of
the (recently popularized) concept of a ‘digital twin’, conceptualized as a digital
replica of a physical entity. Although several researchers have expressed skepticism
about the appropriateness and precision of the term ‘digital twin’ in recent publica-
tions (Batty 2018; Tomko and Winter 2019), it appears that the broad usage of the
term refers to a reasonably rigorous attempt to digitally replicate real-world objects
and phenomena with the highest ﬁdelity possible. Such efforts currently exist for
objects at microscales, such as a wind turbines, engines, and bridges; but they are
also envisioned for humans and other living beings. A digital twin for an entire city
is more ambitious and requires information on the interoperability and connectivity
of every object. A true ‘all containing’ Digital Earth is still unrealized and is more
challenging to construct. However, as Al Gore (1998) noted in his original proposal
for a Digital Earth in 1998, making sense of the information a Digital Earth contains
is even more difﬁcult than its construction. A key capability that supports sensemak-
ing is the ability to visualize geospatial information. There are countless ways to
visualize geospatial information. For thousands of years, humankind has used maps
to understand the environment and ﬁnd our way home. Today, there are many visual
methods for depicting real, simulated, or ﬁctional geospatial ‘worlds’.
This chapter provides an overview of key aspects of visualizing geospatial infor-
mation, including the basic deﬁnitions and organization of visualization-related
knowledge in the context of a future Digital Earth. As understanding related human
factors is necessary for any successful implementation of a visualization within the
Digital Earth framework, we include a section on cognition, perception, and user-
centeredapproachesto(geo)visualization.Becausewealsotypicallyposeandanswer
analytical questions when we visualize information, we provide an overview of visual

analytics; paying special attention to visualizing and analyzing temporal phenom-
ena including movement because a Digital Earth would be clearly incomplete if it
only comprises static snapshots of phenomena. After this examination of broader
visualization-related concepts, because we conceptualize Digital Earth as a virtual
environment, we pay special attention to how augmented (AR), mixed (MR), and
virtual reality (VR) environments can be used to enable a Digital Earth in the section
titled “Immersive Technologies—From Augmented to Virtual Reality”. The Digital
Earth framework is relevant to many application areas, and one of the foremost uses
of the framework is in the domain of urban science. This is unsurprising given that
55 percent of the population now live in urban areas, with the proportion expected to
increase to two-thirds of the population by 2050 (United Nations Population Divi-
sion 2018). Urban environments are complex, and their management requires many
decisions whose effects can cause changes in other parts of the urban environment,
making it important for decision makers to consider these potential consequences.
One way of providing decision makers with an overview of urban environments
is through dashboards. Therefore, we feature “dashboards” and discuss the current
efforts to understand how they ﬁt within the construct of Digital Earth. We ﬁnish the
chapter with a few concluding remarks and future directions.

Visualizing Geospatial Information: An Overview
Cartography is the process by which geospatial information has been typically visu-
alized (especially in the pre-computer era), and the science and art of cartogra-
phy remain relevant in the digital era. Cartographic visualizations are (traditionally)
designed to facilitate communication between the mapmaker and map users. As a
new approach to making sense of geospatial information in the digital era, specif-
ically in the development of digital tools that help map readers interact with this
information, the concept of geovisualization emerged (MacEachren 1994; Çöltekin
et al. 2017, 2018) and widened our understanding of how maps could help make
sense of a Digital Earth when used in an exploratory manner in addition to their
role in communication. Thus, geovisualization is conceived as a process rather than
a product, although the term is also commonly used to refer to any visual display that
features geospatial information (maps, images, 3D models, etc.). In the geovisual-
ization process, the emphasis is on information exploration and sensemaking, where
scientists and other experts design and use “visual geospatial displays to explore data,
and through that exploration to generate hypotheses, develop problem solutions and
construct knowledge” (Kraak 2003a, p. 390) about a geographic location or geo-
graphic phenomenon. How these displays (and associated analytical tools) could
be designed and used became a focus of scientiﬁc research within the International
Cartographic Association’s (ICA) Commission on Visualization and Virtual Environ-
ments, whose leaders described the term geovisualization as the “theory, methods
and tools for visual exploration, analysis, synthesis, and presentation of geospatial
data” (MacEachren and Kraak 2001, p. 3). Designing tools to support visualizing
232
A. Çöltekin et al.
the geospatial information contained in a Digital Earth requires thinking about the
data, representation of those data, and how users interact with those representations.
Importantly, it requires the design of visual displays of geospatial information that
can combine heterogeneous data from any source at a range of spatiotemporal scales
(Nöllenburg 2007). To facilitate the ability to think spatially and infer spatiotemporal
knowledge from a visualization, the visualization must also be usable, support users’
tasks and needs, and enable users to interact with the data (Fuhrmann et al. 2005).
Visualizations of geospatial data connect people, maps, and processes, “leading to
enlightenment, thought, decision making and information satisfaction” (Dykes et al.
2005a, p. 4). Below, we describe three key areas of knowledge that support the design
of visualizations with the goal of helping users make sense of the information that
a Digital Earth contains. The data that are available for incorporation in a Digital
Earth are increasingly heterogeneous and more massive than before. These complex,
large datasets include both spatial and aspatial data, all of which must be combined,
‘hybridized’ (i.e., synthesized in meaningful ways), and represented within a visu-
alization environment. Users expect to be able to visualize complex spatiotemporal
phenomena to analyze and understand spatiotemporal dynamics and systems. To
support them in this, considering user interaction and interfaces is necessary to
develop and incorporate intuitive and innovative ways to explore visual displays.
This is especially relevant to virtual and augmented reality, to facilitate exploration
of data and experiencing spaces ‘without hassle’.
Data A key goal of geovisualization is “to support and advance the individual and
collective knowledge of locations, distribution and interactions in space and time”
(Dykes et al. 2005b, p. 702). This remains a challenge due to increases in the diversity
and quantity of data, users, and available visualization techniques and technologies
(Grifﬁn and Fabrikant 2012). The age of the data deluge (Bell et al. 2009) resulted in
the generation of large quantities of spatial data (vector databases, maps, imagery, 3D
models, numeric models, point clouds, etc.), as well as aspatial data (texts, stories,
web data, photographs, etc.) that can be spatialized (Skupin and Buttenﬁeld 1997).
The ‘covisualization’ of those data together, such as in multiple coordinated views
(or linked views, see Roberts 2007), is difﬁcult due to their heterogeneity. This
heterogeneity can be in the data’s source, scale, content, precision, dimension, and/or
temporality. The visual integration of such heterogeneous data requires the careful
design of graphical representations to preserve the legibility of the data (Hoarau and
Christophe 2017).
7.2.1
Representation
Bertin’s seminal work (1967/1983) provides a conceptual framework, the visual
variables, that allows for us to consider the graphical representation of geospatial
information at a fundamental level (although it is important to note that Bertin’s
propositions were not evidence-based, it was rather based on intuition and qualitative
reasoning). Originally, Bertin proposed seven variables: position, size, shape, color
7
Geospatial Information Visualization and Extended Reality …
233
value, color hue, orientation, and texture. Later work extended Bertin’s framework
to include dynamic variables such as movement, duration, frequency, order, rate of
change, synchronization, (Carpendale 2003; DiBiase et al. 1992; MacEachren 1995)
and variables for 3D displays such as perspective height (Slocum et al. 2008), camera
position, and camera orientation (Rautenbach et al. 2015). Visual variables remain
relevant as a core concept of visualization research and have generated renewed
interest in digital-era research questions, including in ﬁelds beyond geovisualization
(e.g., Mellado et al. 2017). Notably, the information visualization community has also
embraced Bertin’s visual variables (e.g., Spence 2007). Visual complexity is a major
challenge in designing representations of geospatial data, and innovative measures
and analysis methods have been proposed to address this problem (Fairbairn 2006;
Li and Huang 2002; MacEachren 1982; Schnur et al. 2010, 2018; Touya et al. 2016).
Digital Earth’s ‘big data’ challenges these efforts, stretching the capacity of existing
tools to handle and process such datasets as well as the capacity of visualization
users to read, understand, and analyze them (Li et al. 2016). One application area
that is particularly afﬂicted by visual complexity is research on the urban and social
dynamics that drive spatiotemporal dynamics in cities (Brasebin et al. 2018; Ruas
et al. 2011). Developing approaches to represent spatiotemporal phenomena has been
a long-standing challenge and many options have been investigated over the years
(Andrienko and Andrienko 2006). Despite some progress, many questions remain
(see the “Visualizing Movement” section). Some potential solutions such as using
abstraction and schematization when visualizing urban datasets in Digital Earth can
be found in the ﬁelds of data and information visualization (Hurter et al. 2018).
Another key aspect of visual representation design for geospatial data in Digi-
tal Earth applications involves how to deal with uncertainty. Uncertainty, such as
that related to data of past or present states of a location or models of potential
future states, remains difﬁcult to represent in visual displays, and this is a major
challenge for geovisualization designers. Which visual variables might aid in repre-
senting uncertainty? This question has been explored and tested to some degree (e.g.,
MacEachren et al. 2012; Slocum et al. 2003; Viard et al. 2011), although the majority
of research has focused on developing new visualization methods rather than testing
their efﬁcacy (Kinkeldey et al. 2014). There are still no commonly accepted strate-
gies for visualizing uncertainty that are widely applied. MacEachren (2015) suggests
that this is because data uncertainty is only one source of uncertainty that affects rea-
soning and decision making and argues that taking a visual analytics approach (see
the “Geovisual Analytics” section) might be more productive than a communication
approach. Hullman (2016) notes the difﬁculty of evaluating the role of uncertainty
in decision making as a major barrier to developing empirically validated techniques
to represent uncertainty.

7.2.2
User Interaction and Interfaces
Since geovisualization environments are expected to provide tools and interaction
modalities that support data exploration, user interaction and interface design are
important topics for geovisualization. The visual display is an interface for the infor-
mation, so users need effective ways to interact with geovisualization environments.
Interaction modalities in geovisualization environments are ideally optimized or cus-
tomizable for the amount of data, display modes, complexity of spaces or phenom-
ena, and diversity of users (e.g., Hoarau and Christophe 2017). Interaction tools and
modalities are a core interest in human-computer interaction (e.g., Çöltekin et al.
2017) and, in connection with visualization, they are often investigated with con-
cepts explored in the information visualization domain (Hurter 2015; van Wijk and
Nuij 2003), among others. Interaction and how it is designed are especially relevant
for virtual and augmented reality approaches to visualization (see the “Immersive
Technologies—From Augmented to Virtual Reality” section). Some form of inter-
action is required for most modern 2D displays, and it has a very important role
in supporting exploration tasks, but seamless interaction is a necessity in a virtual
or augmented world. Without it, the immersiveness of the visualization—a critical
aspect of both VR and AR—is negatively affected. One approach that is notably at
the intersection of representation design and user interaction design is a set of meth-
ods that are (interactively) nonuniform or space-variant. An example is displays in
which the resolution or level of detail varies across the display in real time according
to a predeﬁned criterion. The best known among these nonuniform display types are
the focus + context and ﬁsheye displays (dating back to the early 1990s, e.g., see
Robertson and Mackinlay 1993). Both the focus + context and ﬁsheye displays com-
bine an overview at the periphery with detail at the center, varying the level of detail
and/or scale across a single display. A variation on the focus + context display has
been named “context-adaptive lenses” (Pindat et al. 2012). Conceptually related to
these approaches, in gaze-contingent displays (GCDs), the level of detail (and other
selected visual variables) is adapted across the display space based on where the user
is looking. This approach draws on perceptual models of the visual ﬁeld, mimicking
the human visual system. GCDs were proposed as early as the 1970s (see, e.g., Just
and Carpenter 1976) and have continued to attract research interest over time as
the technology developed (e.g., Bektas et al. 2015; Duchowski and Çöltekin 2007;
Duchowski and McCormick 1995). For more discussion of “interactive lenses” in
visualization, see the recent review by Tominski et al. (2017). Various other space-
variant visualization approaches have been proposed in which, rather than varying
the scale or level of detail, the levels of realism or generalization are varied across the
display to support focus + context interactions with the data. These approaches aim
to smoothly navigate between data and its representation at one scale (e.g., Hoarau
and Christophe 2017), between different levels of generalization across scales (e.g.,
Dumont et al. 2018), or between different rendering styles (Boér et al. 2013; Semmo
and Döllner 2014; Semmo et al. 2012). Mixed levels of realism have been proposed
for regular maps used for data exploration purposes (Jenny et al. 2012) as well as
7
Geospatial Information Visualization and Extended Reality …
235
for VR. In VR, egocentric-view-VR representations with selective photorealism (a
mix of abstract and photorealistic representations) have been tested in the context
of route learning, memory, and aging and have been shown to beneﬁt users (Lokka
et al. 2018; Lokka and Çöltekin 2019).
Decisions on how to combine data to design representations and user interactions
should be informed by our understanding of how visualization users process visual
information and combine it with their existing knowledge about the location or
phenomenon to make sense of what they see. Thus, building effective visualizations
of geospatial information for a Digital Earth requires an understanding of its users,
their capabilities and their constraints, which we describe in the next section.
7.3
Understanding Users: Cognition, Perception,
and User-Centered Design Approaches for Visualization
A primary way that humans make sense of the world—the real world, an “aug-
mented world” with additional information overlaid, or a virtual word (such as a
simulation)—is by making sense of what we see. Because vision is so important to
human sense-making, visualizations are major facilitators of that process and provide
important support for cognition. When effectively designed, visualizations enable us
to externalize some of the cognitive burden to something we can (re)utilize through
our visual perception (Hegarty 2011; Scaife and Rogers 1996). However, our ability
to see something—in the sense of understanding it—is bounded by our perceptual
and cognitive limits. Thus, any visualizations we design to help work with and under-
stand geospatial information must be developed with the end user in mind, taking
a user-centered design (UCD) approach (Gabbard et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2012;
Jerald 2015; Lloyd and Dykes 2011; Robinson et al. 2005). A UCD approach is use-
ful for understanding perceptual and cognitive limits and for adapting the displays to
these limits. It also helps to evaluate the strengths of new methods of interacting with
visualizations (Roth et al. 2017). For example, a user-centered approach has been
used to demonstrate that an embodied data axis aids in making sense of multivariate
data (Cordeil et al. 2017). Similarly, UCD was useful in determining which simulated
city environments lead to the greatest sense of immersion to support participatory
design processes for smart cities (Dupont et al. 2016), assuming that immersion has
a positive effect in this context.

7.3.1
Making Visualizations Work for Digital Earth Users
7.3.1.1
Managing Information
As brieﬂy noted earlier, a key beneﬁt—and a key challenge—for visualization in the
Digital Earth era is related to the amount of data that is at our ﬁngertips (Çöltekin
and Keith 2011). With so much available data, how can we make sense of it all?
What we need is the right information in the right place at the right time for the
decisions we are trying to make or the activities we are trying to support. Thus,
understanding the context in which information and visualizations of information
are going to be used (Grifﬁn et al. 2017)—what data, by whom, for what purpose, on
what device—is fundamental to designing appropriate and effective visualizations.
For example, ubiquitous sensor networks and continuous imaging of the Earth’s
surface allow for us to collect real-time or near real-time spatial information on ﬁres
and resources available to ﬁght ﬁres, and ﬁreﬁghters would beneﬁt from improved
situation awareness (Weichelt et al. 2018). However, which information should we
show them, and how should it be shown? Are there environmental factors that affect
what information they can perceive and understand from an AR system that visualizes
important ﬁre-related attributes (locations of active burns, wind speed and direction)
and ﬁreﬁghting parameters (locations of teammates and equipment, locations of
members of the public at risk)? How much information is too much to process and
use effectively at a potentially chaotic scene?
A great strength of visualization is its ability to abstract: to remove detail and to
reveal the essence. In that vein, realism as a display principle has been called “naive
realism” because realistic displays sometimes impair user performance but users still
prefer them (e.g., Lokka et al. 2018; Smallman and John 2005). The questions of
how much abstraction is needed (Boér et al. 2013; Çöltekin et al. 2015) and what
level of realism should be employed (Brasebin et al. 2018; Ruas et al. 2011) do not
have clear-cut answers. In some cases, we need to follow the “Goldilocks principle”
because too much or too little realism is suboptimal. As Lokka and Çöltekin (2019)
demonstrated, if there is too much realism, we may miss important details because
we cannot hold all the details in our memory whereas if there is too little, we may
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to learn environments because there are too few ‘anchors’ for the
human memory to link new knowledge of the environment. These issues of how to
abstract data and how it can be effectively visualized for end users are growing in
the era of big data and Digital Earth.
7.3.1.2
Individual and Group Differences
Nearly two decades ago, Slocum et al. (2001) identiﬁed individual and group dif-
ferences as a research priority among the many “cognitive and usability issues in
geovisualization” (as the paper was also titled). There was evidence prior to their
7
Geospatial Information Visualization and Extended Reality …
237
2001 paper and has been additional evidence since then that humans process informa-
tion in a range of ways. Such differences are often based on expertise or experience
(e.g., Grifﬁn 2004; Çöltekin et al. 2010; Ooms et al. 2015) or spatial abilities (e.g.,
Liben and Downs 1993; Hegarty and Waller 2005), and are sometimes based on age
(Liben and Downs 1993; Lokka et al. 2018), gender (Newcombe et al. 1983); culture
(Perkins 2008), conﬁdence and attitudes (e.g., Biland and Çöltekin 2017), or anxiety
(Thoresen et al. 2016), among other factors. For brevity, we do not expand on the root
causes of these differences, as this would require a careful treatment of the “nature
vs. nurture” debate. We know that many of the shortcomings people experience can
be remedied to different degrees based on interventions and/or training. For exam-
ple, spatial abilities, as measured in standardized tests, can be enhanced by training
(Uttal et al. 2013), and expertise/experience and education affect the ways that peo-
ple process information (usually in improved ways, but these forms of knowledge
can also introduce biases). Many of the above factors could be considered cognitive
factors and might be correlated in several ways. A key principle arising from the
awareness that individuals process information differently and that their capacities
to do so can vary (whatever the reason) is that the “designer is not the user” (Richter
et al. 2015, p. 4). A student of geovisualization (we include experts in this deﬁnition)
is a self-selected individual who was likely interested in visual information. With
the addition of education to this interest, it is very likely that a design that a geovi-
sualization expert ﬁnds easy-to-use (or “user friendly”, a term that is used liberally
by many in the technology sector) will not be easy-to-use or user friendly for an
inexperienced user or a younger/older user.
7.3.1.3
Accessibility
Related to the individual and group differences as described above, another key
consideration is populations with special needs. As in any information display, visu-
alization and interaction in a geovisualization software environment should ideally be
designed with accessibility in mind. For example, visually impaired people can ben-
eﬁt from multimedia augmentation on maps and other types of visuospatial displays
(Brock et al. 2015; Albouys-Perrois et al. 2018). Another accessibility issue linked to
(partial) visual impairment that is widely studied in geovisualization is color vision
impairment. This is because color is (very) often used to encode important informa-
tion and color deﬁciency is relatively common, with up to eight percent of the world’s
population experiencing some degree of impairment (e.g., Brychtová and Çöltekin
2017a). Because it is one of the more dominant visual variables (Garlandini and
Fabrikant 2009), cartography and geovisualization research has contributed to color
research for many decades (Brewer 1994; Brychtová and Çöltekin 2015; Christophe
2011; Harrower and Brewer 2003). Two of the most popular color-related applica-
tions in use by software designers were developed by cartography/geovisualization
researchers: ColorBrewer (Harrower and Brewer 2003) for designing/selecting color
palettes and ColorOracle (Jenny and Kelso 2007) for simulating color blindness.
Color is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon even for those who are not affected
238
A. Çöltekin et al.
by color vision impairment. For example, there are perceptual thresholds for color
discrimination that affect everyone (e.g., Brychtová and Çöltekin 2015, 2017b), and
how colors are used and organized contributes to the complexity of maps (e.g., Çöl-
tekin et al. 2016a, b). Color-related research in geographic information science also
includes examination of the efﬁcacy of color palettes to represent geophysical phe-
nomena (Spekat and Kreienkamp 2007; Thyng et al. 2016) or natural color maps
(Patterson and Kelso 2004). We include color in the above discussion because it is
one of the strongest visual variables. However, color is not the only visual variable of
interest to geovisualization researchers. Many other visual variables have been exam-
ined and assessed in user studies. For example, the effects of size (Garlandini and
Fabrikant 2009), position, line thickness, directionality, color coding (Monmonier
2018; Brügger et al. 2017), shading, and texture (Biland and Çöltekin 2017; Çöltekin
and Biland 2018) on map reading efﬁciency have been examined.
It is not possible to provide an in-depth review of all the user studies in the geovi-
sualization domain within the scope of this chapter. However, it is worth noting that if
a design maximizes accessibility, the users beneﬁt and the (consequently) improved
usability of visuospatial displays enables other professionally diverse groups to
access and create their own visualizations: for example, city planners, meteorol-
ogists (e.g., Helbig et al. 2014) and ecoinformatics experts (e.g., Pettit et al. 2010),
all of which are support systems of a ‘full’ future Digital Earth.
7.4
Geovisual Analytics
The science of analytical reasoning with spatial information using interactive visual
interfaces is referred to as geovisual analytics (Andrienko et al. 2007; Robinson
2017). This area of GIScience emerged alongside the development of visual ana-
lytics, which grew out of the computer science and information visualization com-
munities (Thomas and Cook 2005). A key distinction of geovisual analytics from its
predecessor ﬁeld of geovisualization is its focus on support for analytical reasoning
and the application of computational methods to discover interesting patterns from
massive spatial datasets. A primary aim of geovisualization is to support data explo-
ration. Geovisual analytics aims to go beyond data exploration to support complex
reasoning processes and pursues this aim by coupling computational methods with
interactive visualization techniques. In addition to the development of new technical
approaches and analytical methods, the science of geovisual analytics also includes
research aimed at understanding how people reason with, synthesize, and interact
with geographic information to inform the design of future systems. Progress in
this ﬁeld has been demonstrated on each of these fronts, and future work is needed
to address the new opportunities and challenges presented by the big data era and
meeting the vision proposed for Digital Earth.
7
Geospatial Information Visualization and Extended Reality …
239
7.4.1
Progress in Geovisual Analytics
Early progress in geovisual analytics included work to deﬁne the key research chal-
lenges for the ﬁeld. Andrienko et al. (2007) called for decision making support using
space-time data, computational pattern analysis, and interactive visualizations. This
work embodied a shift from the simpler goal of supporting data exploration in geo-
visualization toward new approaches in geovisual analytics that could inﬂuence or
direct decision making in complex problem domains. Whereas the goal in geovisu-
alization may have been to prompt the development of new hypotheses, the goal in
geovisual analytics has become to prompt decisions and actions. To accomplish this
goal, GIScience researchers began to leverage knowledge from intelligence analysis
and related domains in which reasoning with uncertain information is required to
make decisions (Heuer 1999; Pirolli and Card 2005). Simultaneously, there were
efforts to modify and create new computational methods to identify patterns in large,
complex data sources. These methods were coupled to visual interfaces to support
interactive engagement with users. For example, Chen et al. (2008) combined the
SaTScan space-time cluster detection method with an interactive map interface to
help epidemiologists understand the sensitivity of the SaTScan approach to model
parameter changes and make better decisions about when to act on clusters that have
been detected. Geovisual analytics have been applied in a wide range of domain con-
texts, usually targeting data sources and problem areas that are difﬁcult to approach
without leveraging a combination of computational, visual, and interactive tech-
niques. Domains of interest have included social media analytics (Chae et al. 2012;
Kisilevich et al. 2010), crisis management (MacEachren et al. 2011; Tomaszewski
and MacEachren 2012), and movement data analysis (Andrienko et al. 2011; Demšar
and Virrantaus 2010). The following section on “Visualizing Movement” includes a
deeper treatment of the approaches to (and challenges of) using visual analytics for
dynamic phenomena.
A concurrent thread of geovisual analytics research has focused on the design
and evaluation of geovisual analytics tools. In addition to the development of new
computational and visual techniques, progress must also be made in understanding
how geovisual analytics systems aid (or hinder) the analytical reasoning process in
real-world decision making contexts (Çöltekin et al. 2015). Approaches to evaluat-
ing geovisual analytics include perceptual studies (Çöltekin et al. 2010), usability
research (Kveladze et al. 2015), and in-depth case study evaluations of expert use
(Lloyd and Dykes 2011). Additionally, new geovisual analytics approaches have been
developed to support such evaluations (Andrienko et al. 2012; Demšar and Çöltekin
2017), as methods such as eye tracking are capable of creating very large space-time
datasets that require combined computational and interactive visual analysis to be
made sense of.
240
A. Çöltekin et al.
7.4.2
Big Data, Digital Earth, and Geovisual Analytics
The next frontier for geovisual analytics is to address the challenges posed by the
rise of big spatial data. Big data are often characterized by a set of so-called V’s, cor-
responding to the challenges associated with volume, velocity, variety, and veracity,
among others (Gandomi and Haider 2015; Laney 2001). Broadly, geovisual analyt-
ics approaches to handling big spatial data need to address problems associated with
analysis, representation, and interaction (Robinson et al. 2017), similar to the chal-
lenges faced by geovisualization designers. New computational methods are needed
to support real-time analysis of big spatial data sources. Representations must be
developed to render the components and characteristics of big spatial data through
visual interfaces (Çöltekin et al. 2017). We also need to know more about how to
design interactive tools that make sense to end users to manipulate and learn from
big spatial data (Grifﬁn et al. 2017; Roth et al. 2017).
The core elements behind the vision for Digital Earth assume that big spatial
data will exist for every corner of our planet, in ways that support interconnected
problem solving (Goodchild et al. 2012). Even if this vision is achieved (challenging
as that may seem), supporting the analytical goals of Digital Earth will require the
development of new geovisual analytics tools and techniques. Major issues facing
humanity today regarding sustainable global development and mitigating the impacts
of climate change necessarily involve the fusion of many different spatiotemporal
data sources, the integration of predictive models and pattern recognition techniques,
and the translation of as much complexity as is possible into visual, interactive
interfaces to support sensemaking and communication.
7.5
Visualizing Movement
One of the most complex design issues in visualization is how to deal with dynamic
phenomena. Movement is an inherent part of most natural and human processes,
including weather, geomorphological processes, human and animal mobility, trans-
port, and trade. We may also be interested in the movement of more abstract phe-
nomena such as ideas or language. Although movement is a complex spatiotemporal
phenomenon, it is often depicted on static maps, emphasizing geographical aspects
of movement. In the context of visualization, “Digital Earth” implies use of a globe
metaphor, where movement data is displayed on a globe that can be spun and zoomed
(see Fig. 7.1). In this section, we review map-based representations of movement
that can be used within a 3D globe-based immersive environment. Visual representa-
tions that do not emphasize geographical location (e.g., origin-destination matrices
and various timeline-based representations) are less amenable to being used within a
global immersive environment, though they may have a supporting role as multiple
coordinated views.

Note that most techniques for visualizing movement on the Earth’s surface were
developed as 2D representations. However, many of these representations can be
placed on the surface of a 3D globe and we can identify where the 3D environment
may offer beneﬁts and disadvantages. Notably, one disadvantage is that 3D environ-
ments often result in occlusion, and this occlusion is only partially addressed through
interaction (Borkin et al. 2011; Dall’Acqua et al. 2013). Below, we begin by visu-
ally depicting individual journeys and progressively review aggregated movement
data representations, which are more scalable and can synthesize and reveal general
movement patterns (the individual trajectories cannot).
7.5.1
Trajectory Maps: The Individual Journey
Individual journeys can be expressed as trajectories that represent the geometrical
paths (routes) of objects through time as a set of timestamped positions. For example,
if we were interested in migrating birds, GPS loggers attached to individual birds
could produce trajectories (see Fig. 7.2 for an example). These may help understand
the route taken, stop-overs, timing, and interactions between individuals. The detail

with which the geometrical path is captured depends on the temporal resolution of
the sampled locations. Trajectories can also be reconstructed by stringing together
locations from other sensors, for example, from multiple cameras with automatic
license plate recognition or from a set of georeferenced tweets from a single user.
One aspect of trajectories that is often overlooked is how they are segmented, that
is, where they start and stop over the course of the journey. For tracked animals,
algorithms that segment trajectories based on position or time intervals during which
where there is little movement are common (e.g., Buchin et al. 2011). In the example
above (Fig. 7.2), the nest location was used to segment trajectories into foraging
trips.
Trajectory maps depict individual movement by showing the geometrical traces of
individual journeys on a map. Where there are few trajectories, trajectory maps can
clearly illustrate speciﬁc journeys and facilitate visual comparison within an individ-
ual’s journeys or between journeys undertaken by different individuals. An excellent
book by Cheshire and Umberti (2017) uses a whole range of static visualization
methods to illustrate the movements of various types of animals, including trajec-
tory maps. As well as presenting movement traces, trajectory maps can be a useful
7

243
precursor to more substantial and directed analyses (Borkin et al. 2011; Dall’Acqua
et al. 2013).
Map-based representations emphasize the geometry of the path, and it can be dif-
ﬁcult to use maps to determine temporal aspects of the trajectory, including direction
and speed. One option is to use animation, which only displays the parts of trajecto-
ries that are within a moving temporal window. Although animation may be effective
when presented as part of an existing narrative, it can be difﬁcult to detect trends as it
is hard to remember what came before (Robertson et al. 2008). Various user studies
have investigated animation and its efﬁciency and effectiveness for spatiotemporal
tasks, with mixed results. The current understanding is that animations can intro-
duce too much cognitive load if the task requires comparisons, thus, animations
must be used cautiously (Robertson et al. 2008; Russo et al. 2013; Tversky et al.
2002). So-called small multiples (a series of snapshots, see Tufte 1983) can be bet-
ter than animations for some tasks. Another option that is similar to small multiples
in the sense that all of the presented information is visible at all times or is easily on
demand is the use of multiple coordinated views (brieﬂy introduced above). With
multiple coordinated views, a temporal representation of the movement is interac-
tively linked to the map. When the mouse is “brushed” over parts of the trajectory
on the map, corresponding parts on the timeline are identiﬁed and vice versa (as
shown in Fig. 7.2). Brushing along the timeline has a similar effect as animation
but is more ﬂexible. Although trajectory maps can be good to represent relevant
individual instances of journeys, they do not scale well to situations where there
are more than a few trajectories. The effect of over plotting with multiple crossing
lines often obscures patterns. Making trajectories semitransparent can help to some
degree, as it emphasizes common sections of routes by de-emphasizing those that are
less commonly used. Modifying the color hue—and/or other visual variables or sym-
bols—can help identify individuals or categories of journeys (which might include
the purpose of the journey or mode of transport). Hue typically does not facilitate
distinguishing more than approximately ten individuals or categories, but labels and
tooltips can provide such context. Sequential color schemes can indicate continuous
numerical data along trajectories such as speed or height above the ground. Arrows
or tapered lines can help show the direction of movement. To simplify displays, one
can also attempt to simplify the underlying data rather than tweak the display design.
Common approaches include ﬁltering trajectories by various criteria, considering
only origin-destination pairs, or spatiotemporal aggregation (we elaborate on
these approaches below). Trajectory maps can also be shown in a 3D environment.
Space-time cubes (Hägerstrand 1970) are a form of 3D trajectory map (Andrienko
et al. 2003; Kapler and Wright 2004; Kraak 2003b) where the x- and y-axes rep-
resent geographical coordinates and the z-axis represents the progression of time
(see Fig. 7.3 for an example). As with trajectory maps, space-time cubes can indicate
spatiotemporal aspects of small numbers of journeys. However, when more trajecto-
ries are added, the occluding effects can be even more severe than in 2D. Interactive
rotation and zooming of the cube, highlighting trajectories, and interactive ﬁltering
can address the problematic effects of such occlusion but do not scale well to many
trajectories.
244

restaurant and home. Figure based on Kraak (2008) with permission from the original author
In 3D representations, the z-axis can also be used for nontemporal data, which
may create a conﬂict. Where trajectories deﬁne movement in 3D space, the z-axis
can be used to represent a third spatial dimension, that is, it can be used to depict
the height above the ground. There are also many opportunities to depict other
characteristics of trajectories along the z-axis, as illustrated by the “trajectory wall”
(Tominski et al. 2012) shown in Fig. 7.4.
Because the above approaches do not scale well when there are many trajectories,
we must consider simplifying the data and display, such as by ﬁltering the data.
Notably, ﬁltering serves two purposes. The ﬁrst addresses the fact that trajectory
maps do not scale well in situations in which there are more than a few trajec-
tories. The second is to identify multiple trajectories or groups of trajectories
for comparison. Tobler (1987) suggested subsetting and thresholding to reduce
the number of trajectories on a single map. This involves ﬁltering on the basis of
characteristics of trajectories, such as using geographical (see Fig. 7.5 below) and
temporal windows (see Fig. 7.7) through which trajectories can pass or ﬁltering
the trajectory’s length, importance, or category. These are now routinely facilitated
using interactive methods that support visual exploratory data analysis. Identifying
multiple trajectories or groups of trajectories for comparison includes choosing rep-
resentative trajectories for a set of people or different times of the day or different
days of the week. This identiﬁcation of trajectories may be manually achieved as
part of an exploratory analysis or geovisualization approach and can be assisted by

statistical and data mining techniques in a geovisual analytics approach. For exam-
ple, “K-means” clustering can be used to group trajectories into “clusters” (based
on a chosen metric of trajectory similarity) and representative trajectories can be
compared (Andrienko and Andrienko 2011). Visualization techniques that facilitate
such comparisons are simply switching between displaying trajectories or groups of
trajectories by using interactive brushing, superpositioning (where trajectories are
displayed on the same map), or juxtaposition, where maps of groups of trajectories
are displayed side-by-side using small multiples (Tufte 1983).
In summary, trajectory maps are good for showing detailed examples of journeys
but do not scale well to more than a few trajectories. Characteristics of these individ-
ual trajectories can be explored through multiple coordinated views with brushing.
Trajectories are often displayed in maps in 2D, but 3D space-time cubes are also
common. Overplotting many trajectories with semitransparent lines can help indicate
parts of routes that are commonly taken, and a selected trajectory can be highlighted
using a visual variable if there is a reason to emphasize a particular trajectory. In
addition, trajectories can be ﬁltered, grouped, and visually compared. For higher-
level pattern identiﬁcation, it is helpful to perform some aggregation, as discussed
in the next section.
7.5.2
Flow Maps: Aggregated Flows Between Places
Flow maps depict movement between locations or regions. Unlike trajectory maps,
they typically do not represent the route or path taken. This is suitable for cases in
which there are origin-destination pairs; for example, county-country migrations
(Fig. 7.6) and public bike hire journeys taken between pairs of bike docking stations
(Fig. 7.7).
Tobler’s (1987) early ﬂow maps connected locations with straight lines. However,
curved lines help reduce the undesirable occluding effects of line crossings. Jenny
et al. (2018) provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for designing ﬂow maps.
Wood et al. (2011) also used curved lines to distinguish and visually separate ﬂow
in either direction, using asymmetry in the curve to indicate direction (Fig. 7.7).
Yang et al. (2019) provide speciﬁc guidance for designing ﬂow maps on (3D) digital
globes. They recommend taking advantage of the z-axis to design ﬂows with 3D
curvature to help reduce clutter and make the maps more readable and provide
evidence-based advice for displaying ﬂows on 3D globes.
A characteristic of ﬂow data is that it is usually aggregated, with the number
of ﬂows between origin-destination pairs reported. This is facilitated by the fact
that there are often a ﬁnite number of spatial units (origins and destinations), as is
the case for bike docking stations or country-country migration data. This makes
them more scalable but, as shown in Fig. 7.6 (Wood et al. 2011), ﬂow maps can
have clutter and occlusion issues similar to those observed in trajectory maps. These
can be partially addressed by ﬁltering as in trajectory maps, but because ﬂows are
usually already aggregated, ﬁltering by geographical area is likely to reduce such

clutter more effectively to make patterns visible and interpretable (Andrienko and
Andrienko 2011) [see the geographical ﬁltering in the green trajectories shown in
Fig. 7.2]. There are other ways to reduce clutter and provide more interpretable visual
representations of movements, for example, by employing spatial aggregation or
applying edge bundling.
7.5.2.1
Spatial Aggregation of Flows
Spatial aggregation reduces the geographical precision of movement but beneﬁts
visualization. In Fig. 7.6, although the US county-county migration data is already
aggregated by county pair, further aggregating the state-state migration would pro-
duce a more interpretable graphic. However, this additional aggregation is at the
expense of being able to resolve differences within states. In this example, we sug-
gested aggregating the input data by pairs of existing deﬁned regions (counties
and states), but the data can also be aggregated into pairs of data-driven irregu-
lar tessellations (e.g., Voronoi polygons, Fig. 7.8) or regular tessellations (e.g.,
grid cells). Flows can also be generated from full trajectory data (see the above
section) by aggregating the start and end points to spatial units, provided they have
meaningful start and end points. When performing spatial aggregation, it is typical to
disaggregate by temporal unit (e.g., year) and/or by categorical attribute (e.g., gen-
der). This enables comparison of temporal and other attributes, for example, using
small multiples as described in the previous section (e.g., Fig. 7.7 could be arranged
in small multiples by the hour of the day).

7.5.2.2
Edge Bundling of Flows
Edge bundling is a class of techniques designed to layout ﬂows in interpretable
ways, by ‘bundling’ parts of different ﬂows that go in different directions (see the
example in Fig. 7.9). Bundling techniques are used to reduce occlusion and convey
the underlying movement structure (Holten and van Wijk 2009; Fig. 7.10). Jenny
et al. (2017) provide an algorithm to facilitate this. For cases with a speciﬁc origin
or destination of interest, Buchin et al. (2011) suggest an algorithm that aggregates
ﬂows into a tree-like representation that clariﬁes the ﬂow structure (Fig. 7.11).
7.5.3
Origin-Destination (OD) Maps
OD maps (Wood et al. 2011) are also an important tool. They aggregate ﬂows into a
relatively small number of spatial units based on existing units (e.g., states) or those
that result from a Voronoi- or grid-based tessellation. OD maps are effectively small

multiple destination maps. Cases with irregular spatial units should be organized in a
grid layout that preserves as much of the geographical ‘truth’ as possible. The center
of the labels typically indicates the origin (e.g., of migrants or another phenomenon),
and the maps show the destinations from each origin (Fig. 7.9). Flow maps aid in
visually understanding the structure of movement between places (Jenny et al. 2017).
Below, we disregard the connection between the origin and destination and simply
consider the density of movement.
7.5.4
In-Flow, Out-Flow and Density of Moving Objects
This section concerns movement for which we do not have the connection between
origin and destination. This includes situations in which we only have data on the
outﬂow (but do not know where the ﬂow goes), inﬂow (but do not know where the
ﬂow originates from), or the density of moving objects. This can be expressed as
a single value describing the movement for each spatial unit, for example, the out-
migration ﬂow from each county. As described above, the spatial units used may be
derived from existing units (e.g., states) or Voronoi/grid-based tessellations. These
values can be displayed as choropleth maps, in which regions are represented as
tessellating polygons on a map and a suitable color scale is used to indicate in- or
out-movement or the density of moving objects.
When performing spatial aggregation, the data in each spatial unit can be disag-
gregated by temporal unit or by category. Figure 7.12 provides a visual representation
of this, where the density of delivery vehicles is aggregated to 1-km grid squares and
the vehicles in each grid square are disaggregated into densities for ﬁve vehicle types,
the days of the week, and 24 h of the day. Many environmental datasets that describe

of day and vehicle type, using a logarithmic colour scale. Figure based on Slingsby et al. (2010)

the movement of water or air masses do not have a meaningful concept of indi-
vidual journeys. These datasets usually summarize movement as vectors depicting
the ﬂow magnitude and direction within grid cells. Visual representations of these
movements usually take the form of regular arrays of arrows on maps (Fig. 7.13).
Here, vectors represent a summary of ‘movement’ within grid cells. These can be
explored using some of the methods described above, including ﬁltering, temporal
animation, and small multiples. Doing so may result in multiple vectors per grid cell,
which provides an opportunity to symbolize multiple variables as glyphs (Slingsby
2018), for example, for climatic data (Wickham et al. 2012) or a rose diagram at
origin or destination locations. In spatial tessellations, the problem of overlapping
places is not as common. However, the on-screen size of spatial units must be large
enough for the symbolization to be interpreted.

Immersive Technologies—From Augmented to Virtual
Reality
In the virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) domains, there is almost
“visible” excitement, both in academia (off and on for over 30 years)
and in the private sector (more recently). A 2016 Goldman Sachs analy-
sis predicted that VR and AR would be an 80 billion dollar industry by
2025 (reported on CNBC: https://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/14/virtual-reality-could-
become-an-80b-industry-goldman.html). Arguably, geospatial sciences will not be
the same once immersive technologies such as augmented (AR), mixed (MR), and
virtual reality (VR) have been incorporated into all areas of everyday life. In this
chapter, we use the shorthand xR to refer to all immersive technologies and use the
individual acronyms (AR/MR/VR) to refer to speciﬁc technologies. A closely related
term that has recently been gaining momentum is immersive analytics, described
as a blend of visual analytics, augmented reality, and human-computer interaction
(Marriott et al. 2018), which draws on knowledge and experience from several ﬁelds
described in this chapter to develop visualizations of geospatial information that
support thinking. We do not elaborate on immersive analytics; see, e.g., Billinghurst
et al. (2018) and Yang et al. (2019). Current technologies for xR hold promise for
the future, despite being strongly “gadget”-dependent and somewhat cumbersome
and ‘involved’ to set up (i.e., they require some technical skill and dedication). Thus,
it remains to be seen whether these immersive experiences will become common-
place. We describe and elaborate on these display technologies below. We begin by
outlining several concepts that are important for xR technology use.
7.6.1
Essential Concepts for Immersive Technologies
Concepts characterizing immersive technologies and their deﬁnitions are sometimes
subject to debate. This is mainly because their development involves multiple dis-
ciplines. Because there have been parallel developments in different communities,
similar concepts might be named using different terms. The related technology also
evolves quickly, and a newer/improved version of a concept/approach/method/tool
typically gets a new name to distinguish it from the older versions or because technol-
ogy actors want to “brand” their innovative approach, or there is a scientiﬁc paradigm
shift and a new name is needed even though it was based on an older concept. As
in many other interdisciplinary and fast-evolving scientiﬁc disciplines, there is con-
siderable discussion and occasional confusion about terminology. This process of
“maturing” terminology is not unique to immersive technologies. One of the ﬁrst
taxonomies that provided an overview of all xR technologies, and perhaps the most
inﬂuential one, was proposed by Milgram and Kishino (1994), who used the concept
of a continuum from reality to virtuality (see Fig. 7.14).
254
A. Çöltekin et al.
Fig. 7.14 Shown are examples from projects in ChoroPhronesis that demonstrate the reality-
virtuality continuum proposed by Milgram and Kishino (1994). Figure designed by Mark Simpson
Their original deﬁnitions are more nuanced than this continuum and are challeng-
ing to apply in a fast-developing technology ﬁeld. Nonetheless, it is useful to revisit
some of their main distinctions for a conceptual organization of the terms in xR.
A confusing, yet central, term is immersion (see the “Virtual Reality” subsection
below). Currently, the commonsense understanding of immersion is different than
its rather narrow focus in the technical VR literature. For example, Slater (2009)
distinguishes immersion from presence, with the former indicating a physical char-
acteristic of the medium itself for the different senses involved. Presence is reserved
for the psychological state produced in response to an immersive experience. To
illustrate a simple example, Fig. 7.15 shows three experimental setups that were
used in a recent study on how different levels of immersion inﬂuence the feeling of
being present in a remote meeting (Oprean et al. 2018).
In this study, Oprean et al. (2018) compared a standard desktop setting (the lowest
level of immersion) with a three-monitor setup (medium level of immersion) and an
immersive headset (the Oculus Rift, DK2). One can “order” these technologies along
a spectrum of immersiveness (as in Fig. 7.16), which helps in designing experiments
to test whether or not feeling physically immersed affects aspects of thinking or
collaboration (e.g., on the subjective feeling of team membership). Another key
concept for immersive technologies, and a research topic in itself, is interaction
(also discussed in the “Visualizing Geospatial Information” section). Interaction is
important for any form of immersive technology because the classical “keyboard
and mouse” approach does not work well (or at all) when the user is standing and/or
moving. Interaction, along with immersion, is one of the four “I” terms proposed as
the deﬁning elements of VR; the other two are information intensity and intelligence
of objects, as proposed by MacEachren et al. (1999a) in the 1990s. We elaborate on
the four “I”s and other relevant considerations in the Virtual Reality section because
they are discussed most often in the context of VR, and are relevant for other forms
7
Geospatial Information Visualization and Extended Reality …
255

Increased immersion is supported by a combination of an increased ﬁeld of view and the use
of an egocentrically ﬁxed rather than an allocentrically ﬁxed reference frame. Based on Oprean
et al. (2017) with the original author’s permission
of xR. In addition to Milgram and Kishino’s (1994) continuum, there are many other
ways to organize and compare immersive technologies. For example, a recent take
on levels of realism and immersion is shown Fig. 7.16. This example extends the
immersiveness spectrum by considering where visualization designs are located on
an additional continuum: abstraction-realism.

7.6.2
Augmented Reality
In Milgram and Kishino’s (1994) model, the ﬁrst step from reality toward virtuality
is augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality allows for the user to view virtual
objects superimposed onto a real-world view (Azuma 1997). Technological advance-
ments have allowed for augmented reality to evolve from bulky head-mounted dis-
plays (HMDs) in the 1960s to smartphone applications today (some examples are
featured below), and through specialized (though still experimental) glasses such as
Google Glass or Epson Moverio (Arth and Schmalstieg 2011). Although technology
has truly advanced since the early—bulky and rather impractical—HMDs, there are
still challenges in the adoption of augmented reality for dedicated geospatial appli-
cations in everyday life. These challenges are often technical, such as latency and the
inaccuracy of sensors when using smartphones, and result in inaccuracies in regis-
tration of features and depth ambiguity (Arth and Schmalstieg 2011; Chi et al. 2013;
Gotow et al. 2010). There are also design issues that should be considered and, ide-
ally, user-evaluated when developing and designing a “geospatial” AR application
(Arth and Schmalstieg 2011; Cooper 2011; Kounavis et al. 2012; Kourouthanassis
et al. 2015; Kurkovsky et al. 2012; Olsson 2012; Tsai et al. 2016; Vert et al. 2014).

257
Akçayır and Akçayır (2017) and Wu et al. (2013) reviewed the current state of
AR in education. They concluded that AR provides a unique learning environment
because it combines digital and physical objects, an insight relevant to students
and scientists who are learning about geographical systems. An example of AR
in education and research is the “augmented reality sandbox” (https://arsandbox.
ucdavis.edu) that has been widely used, for example, in an urban/landscape design
experiment (Afrooz et al. 2018). A similar application is the “tangible landscape”
(https://tangible-landscape.github.io) (Petrasova et al. 2015). Both of these appli-
cations superimpose an elevation color map, topographic contour lines, and sim-
ulated water on a physical sand model that can be physically (re)shaped by the
user. A tourism-related science and education example is the “SwissARena”, which
superimposes a 3D model on top of topographic maps of Switzerland (Wüest and
Nebiker 2018), enabling smartphone and tablet users to visit museums and other
public spaces through an augmented experience. Motivated by a fundamental (rather
than an applied) question, Carrera and Bermejo Asensio (2017) tested whether the
use of AR improves participants’ (spatial) orientation skills when interpreting land-
scapes. They found a signiﬁcant improvement in participants’ orientation skills when
using a 3D AR application. However, some pedagogical questions (e.g., how should
AR be used to complement the learning objectives; what is the gap between teaching
and learning?) and other usability gaps (e.g., it was difﬁcult to use at ﬁrst, unsuitable
for large classes, cognitive overload, expensive technology, and inadequate teacher
ability to use the technology) identiﬁed by Akçayır and Akçayır (2017) and Wu et al.
(2013) regarding the use of AR in teaching need to be addressed. Given that early
research suggests that AR might aid in developing spatial skills, its potential in edu-
cation (especially in science education) appears to be reasonably high. Furthermore,
there appear to be several beneﬁts of using AR in research. For example, it has been
suggested that AR is an excellent tool for collaborative work among researchers
(Jacquinod et al. 2016). At the time of this writing, there are no common examples of
these types of applications in use, but there have been various experimental imple-
mentations of AR in research and scientiﬁc visualization (e.g., Devaux et al. 2018).
Thus, most of the present excitement about AR seems to be based on belief and
intuition, which can be correct but may also mislead.
7.6.3
Mixed Reality
As conceptualized in the Milgram and Kishino (1994) model (Fig. 7.15), the term
Mixed Reality (MR)—sometimes referred to as Hybrid Reality—applies to every-
thing in between the real world and a virtual world. Therefore, the term includes
AR, and the issues described above about AR also apply to MR. MR also includes
augmented virtuality (AV). AV refers to virtual environments that are designed so
that physical objects still play a role. Of the two subcategories of MR (AR and AV),
AR is more developed at this point in time. Nonetheless, AV is relevant in a number
of VR scenarios. For example, when we want haptic feedback, we give users suits

or gloves. It is also relevant when we want to interact with the virtual world using
any kind of hardware. Using hardware to drive interaction is the current state of the
art; that is, although there are an increasing number of gesture tracking methods
that map functions onto the body’s natural movements, several of the controls are
physical objects, such as remote controls, often referred to as “wands”, or small
trackable objects attached to the viewers called “lights”. Any combination (hybrid)
environments of physical and virtual objects can be considered a form of MR. We do
not expound on MR in this chapter, and any information presented in the AR section
above and most of the information in the VR section below is relevant to MR.
7.7
Virtual Reality
How should we deﬁne virtual reality? There is no consensus on the “minimum
requirements” of VR, though it is understood that an ideal VR system provides
humans experiences that are indistinguishable from an experience that could be real.
Ideally, a VR should stimulate all senses. That is, a virtual apple you eat should
look, smell, and taste real, and when you bite, the touch and sounds should be just
right. Current VR technologies are not there yet. The sense of vision (and the associ-
ated visualizations) has been investigated a great deal and audio research has made
convincing progress, but we have a long way to go in terms of simulating smells,
tastes, and touch. There are no hard and fast rules for “minimum requirements”
for a display to qualify as VR, but there have been various attempts to systemati-
cally characterize and distinguish VR from other types of displays (see Fig. 7.16).
Among these, Sherman and Craig (2003) list four criteria: a virtual world (graph-
ics), immersion, interactivity, and sensory feedback. They distinguish interaction
and sensory feedback in the sense that interaction occurs when there is an inten-
tional user request whereas sensory feedback is embedded at the system level and
is fed to the user based on tracking the user’s body. In the cartographic literature,
a similar categorization was proposed even earlier by MacEachren et al. (1999b) in
which they describe the Four ‘I’s, adding intelligence of objects to Heim’s (1998)
original three ‘I’s: immersion, interactivity, information intensity. The Four ‘I’s and
Sherman and Craig’s criteria have clear overlaps in immersion and interactivity, and
links between a “virtual world” and “information intensity” and between “sensory
feedback” and “intelligence of objects” can be drawn. Notably, some authors make
a distinction between virtual reality and virtual environments: the term virtual real-
ity does not exactly refer to mimicking reality (but an experience that feels real to
the user). Nonetheless, because the word reality can invoke such an impression, the
term virtual environment emerged. The term originated because one can also show
ﬁctional (or planned) environments using a visualization environment, and thus, the
term “environment” more effectively encapsulates the range of things one can do in
such a visualization environment. Below, we give a brief history of VR in domains
that are directly related to Digital Earth and elaborate on what was once described
as a “virtual geographic environment” (VGE).

7.7.1
Virtual Geographic Environments
An extension of earlier conceptualizations of ‘virtual geography’ (e.g., Batty 1997;
MacEachren et al. 1999a), the term VGE was formally proposed at the beginning
of the 21st century (attributed to Lin and Gong 2001) around the same time as the
seminal book by Fisher and Unwin (2001). Since its beginnings, the VGE concept and
accompanying tools have signiﬁcantly evolved. A modern description of a VGE is
a digital geographic environment “generated by computers and related technologies
that users can use to experience and recognize complex geographic systems and
further conduct comprehensive geographic analyses, through equipped functions,
including multichannel human-computer interactions (HCIs), distributed geographic
modeling and simulations, and network geo-collaborations” (Chen and Lin 2018,
p. 329). Since their conception, VGEs have attracted considerable attention in the
geographic information science research community over the last few decades (e.g.,
Goodchild 2009; Huang et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2015; Konecny 2011; Liang et al.
2015; Mekni 2010; Priestnall et al. 2012; Rink et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2018; Torrens
2015; Zhang et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2017). Much like the “digital twin” idea,
and well-aligned with the Digital Earth concept, VGEs often aim to mirror real-
world geographic environments in virtual ones. Such a mirrored virtual geographic
environment also goes beyond reality, as it ideally enables its user to visually perceive
invisible or difﬁcult-to-see phenomena in the real world, and explore them inside the
virtual world (e.g., looking at forests at different scales, examining historical time
periods, seeing under the ocean’s surface). As it can incorporate advanced analytic
capabilities, a VGE can be superior to the real world for analysts. In an ideal VGE, one
can view, explore, experience and analyze complex geographic phenomena. VGEs
are not ‘just’ 3D GIS environments, but there are strong similarities between VGEs
and immersive analytics approaches. A VGE can embed all the tools of a GIS, but a
key point of a VGE is that they are meant to provide realistic experiences, as well as
simulated ones that are difﬁcult to distinguish from real-world experiences. A VGE
would not be ideal if only analytics are needed, as 2D plans combined with plots
may better facilitate the analyst’s goals. The combination of a traditional GIS and
the power of immersive visualization environments offers novel ways to combine
human cognitive abilities with what machines have to offer (Chen and Lin 2018; Lin
et al. 2013a).
7.7.2
Foundational Structures of VGEs
Lin et al. (2013b) designed a conceptual framework that includes four VGE suben-
vironments: data, modeling and simulation, interaction, and collaborative spaces.
They posit that a geographic database and a geographic model are core necessities
for VGEs to support visualization, simulation, and collaboration. Below, we brieﬂy
elaborate on the four VGE subenvironments (Lin et al. 2013b).
260
A. Çöltekin et al.
7.7.2.1
Data Space
The “data space” is conceptualized as the ﬁrst step in the pipeline of creating a VGE.
This is where data are organized, manipulated, and visualized to prepare the digital
infrastructurenecessaryforaVGE.Onecanalsodesignthisenvironmentsothatusers
can “walk” in their data and examine it for patterns and anomalies (as in immersive
analytics). The data is ideally comprehensive (i.e., “information intensity” is desir-
able), such that semantic information, location information, geometric information,
attribute information, feature spatiotemporal/qualitative relationships and their evo-
lution processes are considered and organized to form virtual geographic scenarios
with a range of visualization possibilities (e.g., standard VR displays, holograms, or
other xR modes) and thus support the construction of VGEs (Lü et al. 2019).
7.7.2.2
Modeling and Simulation Space
Models and simulations, as the abstraction and expression of geographical phenom-
ena and processes, are important means for modern geographic research (Lin et al.
2015). With the rapid development of networks, cloud/edge computing, and other
modern technologies, modeling and simulation capabilities allow for a large range
of exploration and experimentation types (e.g., Wen et al. 2013, 2017; Yue et al.
2016). VGEs can also integrate such technologies. Chen et al. (2015) and Chen and
Lin (2018) propose that doing so would provide new modes for geographic problem
solving and exploration, and potentially help users understand the Digital Earth.
7.7.2.3
Interaction Space
In general, interaction is what shifts a user from being a passive ‘consumer’ of
information and makes them active producers of new information (see the “Geovi-
sualization” section earlier in this chapter). In VGEs, interaction requires a different
way of thinking than for desktop setups because the aspiration is to create experi-
ences that are comparable to those in the real world (i.e., mouse-and-keyboard type
interactions do not work well in VGEs). Thus, there have been considerable efforts
to track a user’s hands, head, limbs, and eyes to model natural interaction. Interaction
tools play an important role in information transmission between the VGE and its
users (Batty et al. 2017; Voinov et al. 2018).
7.7.2.4
Collaboration Space
In addition to the interaction between a human and a machine, it is important to
consider the interactions between humans, ideally, as it occurs in the real world
(or improving upon real-world collaboration). At present, there is an increasing
7
Geospatial Information Visualization and Extended Reality …
261
demand for collaborative work, especially when solving complex problems. Com-
plex geographic problem solving may require participants from different domains,
and collaboration-support tools such as VGEs might help them communicate with
each other. There are many examples of collaborative research based on VGEs (e.g.,
Chen et al. 2012; Li et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2015). If the four suben-
vironments are well-designed, VGEs could become effective scientiﬁc tools and
advance geography research: simulations in a VGE could be systematically and
comprehensively explored to deepen scientists’ understanding of complex systems
such as human-environment interactions. Virtual scenarios corresponding to real-
world scenarios with uniﬁed spatiotemporal frameworks can be employed to support
integration of human and environmental resources. With Digital Earth infrastructure
and modern technological developments, geographical problems at multiple scales
can be solved and related virtual scenarios can be developed for deep mining and
visual analysis (e.g., Lin et al. 2013b; Fig. 7.17). Importantly, VGEs can support
collaborative exploration beyond reality. Working with virtual scenarios, users can
communicate and conduct collaborative research free from the constraints of physical
space (and in some cases, time).
This chapter so far has focused on theoretical constructs and examples of geo-
graphical visualization that can be used to represent and provide insights into our
Earth system. However, it is also important to consider how such visualizations can

be presented to policy and decision-makers to plan for a more sustainable future.
The next section outlines a number of platforms for engaging such end users with
packaged geographical information, known as dashboards.
7.8
Dashboards
A true Digital Earth describes Earth and all its systems, including ecosystems, cli-
mate/atmospheric systems, water systems, and social systems. Our planet faces a
number of great challenges including climate change, food security, an aging popu-
lation, and rapid urbanization. As policy-makers, planners, and communities grapple
with how to address these critical problems, they beneﬁt from digital tools to monitor
the performance of our management of these systems using speciﬁc indicators. With
the rise of big data and open data, a number of dashboards are being developed
to support these challenges, enabled by geographical visualization technologies and
solutions (Geertman et al. 2017). Dashboards can be deﬁned as “graphic user inter-
faces which comprise a combination of information and geographical visualization
methods for creating metrics, benchmarks, and indicators to assist in monitoring and
decision-making” (Pettit and Leao 2017).
One can think of dashboards as installations that can provide key indicators of the
performance of a particular Earth system, powered through the construct of Digital
Earth. In 2016, the United Nations launched 17 Sustainable Development Goals to
guide policy and funding priorities until 2030. Each of these goals include a number
of indicators that can be quantiﬁed and reported within a Digital Earth dashboard, as
illustrated, for example, such as in SDG Index and Dashboards (https://dashboards.
sdgindex.org/#/) (Sachs et al. 2018).
For illustrative purposes, we focus on one SDG 11—Sustainable Cities and Com-
munities, as there are a number of city dashboard initiatives that aim to provide
citizens and visitors access to a rich tapestry of open data feeds. Data in these feeds
are typically aggregated and presented to the user online and can include, for exam-
ple, data on trafﬁc congestion, public transport performance, air quality, weather
data, social media streams, and news feeds. Users can interact with the data and
perform visual analyses via different/multiple views, which might include graphs,
charts, and maps. Examples include the London Dashboard (Gray et al. 2016) and
the Sydney Dashboard (Pettit et al. 2017a), illustrated in Fig. 7.18.
There are also advanced dashboard platforms that support data-driven policy and
decisionsthroughanalytics.Forcities,therehasbeenanincreaseinthenumberofcity
analytics dashboard platforms such as the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure
Network (AURIN) workbench (Pettit et al. 2017b). The AURIN workbench provides
users with access to over 3,500 datasets through an online portal. This portal provides
data and includes more than 100 spatial-statistical tools (Sinnott et al. 2015). The
AURIN workbench (Fig. 7.19) enables users to visualize census data and a number
of other spatial datasets, including the results of statistical analyses through multiple
coordinated (i.e., linked) views. Thus, it enables geovisual analytics as the user

can brush between maps, graphs, charts, and scatterplots to explore the various
dimensions of a city (Widjaja et al. 2014). In an era of smart cities, big data, and
city analytics, an increasing number of geographical visualization platforms include
both data and simulations to benchmark the performance of urban systems.
Dashboard views of the performance of Earth systems such as urban systems have
a number of pros and cons. Dashboards can potentially provide the best available data
on the performance of an urban system or natural asset so that decisions can account
for multiple dimensions, including sustainability, resilience, productivity, and liv-
ability. Dashboards are also a window into the democratization of data and provide
264
A. Çöltekin et al.
greater transparency and accountability in policy- and decision-making. However,
there are a number of challenges in developing and applying dashboards; without
good quality indicators and benchmarks, the utility of such digital presentations of
performance can be questionable. Traditionally, dashboards have provided a unidi-
rectional ﬂow of information to their users. However, with the emergence of digital
twins, there may be an opportunity for a true bidirectional ﬂow of data between
dashboards, their users and Earth systems.
7.9
Conclusions
Our understanding of the vision of Digital Earth is that it is a fully functional virtual
reality system. To achieve such a system, we need to master every aspect of relevant
technology and design and keep the users in mind. Visualization is an interdisci-
plinary topic with relevance in many areas of life in the digital era, especially given
that there is much more data to analyze and understand than ever before. Because the
Earth is being observed, measured, probed, listened to, and recorded using dozens
of different sensors, including people (Goodchild 2007), the data we need to build a
Digital Earth is now available (at least for parts of the Earth). Now, the challenge is
to organize these data at a global scale following cartographic principles so that we
can make sense of it. Herein lies the strength of visualization. By visualizing the data
in multiple ways, we can create, recreate, and predict experiences, observe patterns,
and detect anomalies. Recreating a chat with an old neighbor in our childhood living
room 30 years later (e.g., instead of looking at a photo album) is no longer a crazy
thought; we might be recording enough data to be able to do such things soon. The
possibilities are endless. However, as inspiring as this may be, one must understand
how to “do it right”; that is, we have much to learn before we will know what exactly
we should show, when and to whom. In this chapter, we provided an overview of the
current state of the art of topics related to visualization in the context of Digital Earth.
We hope this chapter provided some insights into our current broad understanding
of this challenge.

Transformation in Scale for Continuous
Zooming
Zhilin Li and Haowen Yan
Abstract This chapter summarizes the theories and methods in continuous zooming
for Digital Earth. It introduces the basic concepts of and issues in continuous zooming
and transformation in scale (or multiscale transformation). It presents the theories of
transformation in scale, including the concepts of multiscale versus variable scale,
transformation in the Euclidean space versus the geographical space, and the the-
oretical foundation for transformation in scale, the Natural Principle. It addresses
models for transformations in scale, including space-primary hierarchical models,
feature-primary hierarchical models, models of transformation in scale for irregular
triangulation networks, and the models for geometric transformation of map data.
It also discusses the mathematical solutions to transformations in scale (including
upscaling and downscaling) for both raster (numerical and categorical data) and vec-
tor (point set data, line data set and area data) data. In addition, some concluding
remarks are provided.

Continuous Zooming and Transformation in Scale:
An Introduction
8.1.1
Continuous Zooming: Foundation of the Digital Earth
Continuous zooming is a fundamental function of a Digital Earth, as the demand for
such a function has been vividly portrayed by then-US Vice President Al Gore in
his famous speech “The Digital Earth: Understanding Our Planet in the twenty-ﬁrst
Century” (Gore 1998):
Imagine, for example, a young child going to a Digital Earth exhibit at a local museum.
After donning a head-mounted display, she sees Earth as it appears from space. Using a
data glove, she zooms in, using higher and higher levels of resolution, to see continents,
then regions, countries, cities, and ﬁnally individual houses, trees, and other natural and
man-made objects.
The cascade scene seen by the young child is a result of continuous zooming. Such
zooming can be realized by continuously displaying a series of Earth images taken
at a given position and changing the focal length of the camera lens continuously or
displaying images taken at different heights continuously but with at a ﬁxed camera
focal length.
In theory, to make the display visually smooth, the differences between two images
should be sufﬁciently small, thus the number of images in such a series is very large,
which demands huge data storage. Thus, it is a very difﬁcult, if not impossible,
problem.
8.1.2
Transformation in Scale: Foundation of Continuous
Zooming
In practice, Earth images are acquired and stored at discrete scales (e.g., 1:500,000,
1:100,000, 1:10,000) or different resolutions (e.g., 100, 10, 1, 0.5 m), leading to the
term multiscale representation. Figure 8.1 shows a series of satellite images covering
Hong Kong Polytechnic University at six different scales, extracted from Google
Maps. If such images at discrete scales are displayed in sequence, there will be a
visual jump between two images. The obviousness of the visual jump is dependent
on the magnitude of the scale difference. The smaller the difference between the two
scales is, the less apparent the visual jump will be.
To minimize the effect of such visual jumps, some techniques are required to
smooth the transformations from one scale to another scale to make the display appear
like continuous zooming. This transformation in scale is the foundation of continuous
zooming. Thus, transformation in scale, also called multiscale transformation, is the
topic of this chapter.

Transformation in Scale: A Fundamental Issue
in Disciplines Related to Digital Earth
Transformation in scale is one of the most important but unsolved issues in various
disciplines related to Digital Earth, such as mapping, geography, geomorphology,
oceanography, soil science, social sciences, hydrology, environmental sciences and
urban studies. Typical examples are map generalization and the modiﬁable areal unit
problem (MAUP). Although transformation in scale is a traditional topic, it has been
a critical issue in this digital era.
Transformation in scale has attracted attention from disciplines related to Digital
Earth since the 1980s because a few important publications on the scale issue in
that period awakened researchers in relevant areas. Openshaw (1984) revisited the
MAUP. Abler (1987) reported that multiscale representation was identiﬁed as one
of the initiatives of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis
(NCGIA), and noted that zooming and overlay are the two most exciting functions
in a geographical information system. Since then, the scale issue has been included
in many research agendas (e.g., Rhind 1988; UCGIS 2006) and has become popular
in the geo-information community.
The ﬁrst paper on the scale issue in remote sensing was also published in 1987
(Woodcock and Strahler 1987). Later, in 1993, the issue of scaling from point to
282

regional- or global-scale estimates of the surface energy ﬂuxes attracted great atten-
tion at the Workshop on Thermal Remote Sensing held at La Londe les Maures,
France from September 20–24. Scale became a hot topic in remote sensing as well.
As a result, many papers on the scale issue have been published in academic
journals and at conferences related to Digital Earth. Other papers have been p in the
form of edited books, such as Scaling Up in Hydrology Using Remote Sensing edited
by Stewart et al. (1996), Scale in Remote Sensing and GIS edited by Quattrochi
and Goodchild (1997), Scale Dependence and Scale Invariance in Hydrology edited
by Sposito (1998), Modelling Scale in Geographical Information Science edited
by Tate and Atkinson (2001), Scale and Geographic Inquiry: Nature, Society and
Method edited by Sheppard and McMaster (2004), Generalisation of Geographic
Information: Cartographic Modelling and Applications edited by Mackaness et al.
(2007),andScaleIssuesinRemotesensingeditedbyWeng(2014).Authoredresearch
monographs have also been published by researchers, e.g., Algorithmic Foundation
of Multi-Scale Spatial Representation by Li (2007) and Integrating Scale in Remote
Sensing and GIS by Zhang et al. (2017).
8.2
Theories of Transformation in Scale
Transformation in scale is the modeling of spatial data or spatial representations
from one scale to another by employing mathematical models and/or algorithms
developed based on certain scaling theories and/or principles. This section describes
such scaling theories and/or principles.
8.2.1
Transformation in Scale: Multiscale Versus Variable
Scale
To facilitate zooming, not necessarily continuous, a common practice of service
providers such as Google Maps, Virtual Earth and Tianditu is to organize maps and
images into nearly 20 levels (scales or resolutions), from global level to street level.
Figure 8.2 shows a series of maps covering Hong Kong Polytechnic University at six
different scales (extracted from Google Maps). This follows the tradition of organiz-
ingmapsbynationalmapagencies.Forexample,theUnitedStatesGeologicalSurvey
(USGS) produces topographic maps at scales of 1:500,000, 1:250,000, 1:100,000,
1:50,000 and 1:24,000; the Chinese State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping pro-
duces maps at scales of 1:4,000,000, 1:1,000,000, 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:10,000;
the Ordnance Survey of the UK produces maps at scales of 1:50,000, 1:25,000 and
1:10,000; and the German federal states produces maps at 1:1,000,000, 1:250,000,
1:100,000, 1:50,000, 1:25,000 and 1:10,000 scales. These maps at different scales
contain information at different levels of detail, and thus are suitable for different
8

283

from Google Maps)
applications. Such a scale is also called the cartographic ratio. Similarly, image data
and digital elevation models (DEMs) are also produced and stored at discrete scales.
In these two cases, the scale is normally indicated by resolution.
This kind of representation is called multiscale representation. In such cases, the
cartographic ratio is uniform across a map and/or an image. Thus, such represen-
tations have multiple cartographic ratios. The cartographic ratio may vary across a
representation (e.g., oblique view), leading to the term variable scale representation;
the resolution may also vary across a representation, leading to the term variable res-
olution representation. As a result, the term multiscale might mean different things to
different people, i.e., multi cartographic ratio, variable cartographic ratio, multi res-
olution and variable resolution. This leads to nine different kinds of transformations
in scale, as shown in Fig. 8.3.
8.2.2
Transformations in Scale: Euclidean Versus
Geographical Space
In Euclidean space, an increase in scale will commonly cause an increase in length,
area and volume; and a decrease in scale will cause a decrease in length, area and
volume, accordingly. Figure 8.4 shows an example of scale reduction and increase in

a 2D Euclidean space. In such a transformation in scale, the absolute complexity of
a feature or features remains unchanged. That is, the transformations are reversible.
However, the geographical space is fractal. If one measures a coastal line using
different measurement units, then different lengths will be obtained. The smaller the
measurement unit is, the longer the length obtained. Similarly, different length values
will be obtained when measuring a coastal line represented on maps at different scales
using identical measurement units at map scale. That is, the transformation in scale
in fractal geographical space is quite different from that in Euclidean space.
For a given area on a terrain surface, the size of the graphic representation (or map
space) on a smaller scale map is reduced compared with that on larger scale maps.
The complexity of the graphics on a smaller scale map remain compatible with larger
scale maps. However, the absolute complexity is reduced. As a result, if the graphics
on a smaller map are enlarged back to the size on the larger scale map, the level
of complexity of the enlarged representation will appear to be reduced. Figure 8.5
illustrates such a case. In a fractal geographical space, the level of complexity cannot
be recovered by an increase in scale. In other words, the transformations in scale in
such a geographical space are not reversible.
The transformation in scale is also termed scaling. The process of making the
resolution coarser (or making the map scale smaller) is called upscaling. In contrast,
the transformation process to make the resolution ﬁner (or map scale larger) is called
downscaling.
8.2.3
Theoretical Foundation for Transformation in Scale:
The Natural Principle
One question that arises is “does such a transformation follow any principle or law?”
The answer is “yes”. Li and Openshaw (1993) formulated the Natural Principle for
such a transformation in scale in fractal geographical space.
286
Z. Li and H. Yan
Li and Openshaw (1993) made use of the terrain surface viewed from different
height levels as an example to illustrate the Natural Principle, as follows:
• When one views the terrain surface from the Moon, all terrain variations disappear,
and one can only see a blue ball;
• When one views the terrain surface from a satellite, then the terrain surface
becomes visible, but the terrain surface looks very smooth;
• When one views the terrain surface from an airplane, the main characteristics of
the terrain variations become very clear, but small details do not appear; and
• When one views the terrain surface from a position on ground, the main charac-
teristics of the terrain variations become lost, and one sees small details.
When the viewpoint is higher, the ground area corresponding to the human eyes’
resolution becomes larger, but all detailed variations within this ground area can no
longer be seen, and thus the terrain surface appears more abstract. These examples
underline a universal principle, the Natural Principle as termed by Li and Openshaw
(1993). It can be stated as follows:
For a given scale of interest, all details about the spatial variations of geographical objects
(features) beyond a certain limitation cannot be presented and can thus be neglected.
It follows that a simple corollary to this process can be used as a basis for transfor-
mations in scale. The corollary can be stated as follows (Li and Openshaw 1993):
By using a criterion similar to the limitation of human eyes’ resolution, and, neglecting all
the information about the spatial variation of spatial objects (features) beyond this limitation,
zooming (or generalization) effects can be achieved.
Li and Openshaw (1992) also term such a limitation as the smallest visible object
(SVO)orsmallestvisiblesize(SVS)inotherliterature(Li2007).Figure8.6illustrates
Fig. 8.6 The natural principle: spatial variations within a smallest visible size (SVS) to be neglected
(Li 2007)
8
Transformation in Scale for Continuous Zooming
287
the idea of this corollary, that is, that all spatial variations within the SVS can be
neglected, no matter how big they are on the ground.
Figure 8.7 illustrates the working example of applying the Natural Principle to
a terrain surface. Figure 8.7a shows the views of a terrain surface at two different
heights based on the Natural Principle, resulting in two quite different representations
in terms of complexity. Figure 8.7b, c show the results viewed at levels L A and L B,
respectively. In these two Figures, the zooming (or generalization) effects are very
clear.
To apply the Natural Principle, the critical element to be considered is the value
of this “certain limitation” or SVS, beyond which all spatial variations (no matter
how complicated) can be neglected. Li and Openshaw (1992, 1993) suggested the
following formula:

where ST and SS are the scale factors of the target and source data, respectively; k is
the SVS value in terms of map distance at the target scale and K is the SVS value in
terms of ground distance at the target scale. Through intensive experimental testing,
Li and Openshaw (1992) recommend a k value between 0.5 and 0.7 mm, i.e.,
k = {0.5 mm, 0.7 mm}
(8.2)
8.3
Models for Transformations in Scale
To realize a transformation in scale, some transformation models must be adopted
and algorithms and/or mathematical functions for these models are applied. The
former is the topic of this section and the latter are described in Sect. 8.4.
8.3.1
Data Models for Feature Representation:
Space-Primary Versus Feature-Primary
To record features in geographical space, two different viewpoints can be taken:
feature-primary and space-primary (Lee et al. 2000).
Inafeature-primaryview,thegeographicalspaceisconsideredasbeingtessellated
by features and the locations of these features are then determined. This kind of
model is also called feature-based. In such a model, features are represented by
vectors, leading to the popular term vector data model. Figure 8.8a–c show the
representation of points, a line and an area using a vector model.
In a space-primary view, the geographical space is considered as being tessellated
by space cells. In such a tessellation (partitioning), square raster cells are popularly
employed, leading to the popular term raster data model. In each raster cell, there
could be a feature or there might be no features. A point is represented by a pixel
(picture element); a line is represented by a string of connected pixels and an area
is formed by a set of connected pixels, as shown in Fig. 8.8d–f. The cells can be
in any form, regular or irregular. Irregular triangular networks are another popular
tessellation.
On a spherical surface, longitude/latitude is the coordinate system for feature-
primary representation. The cells with an equal interval in latitude/longitude (e.g.,
6′ × 6′) are the raster equivalent of spherical tessellation (Fig. 8.9a). However, the
actual area size of such a cell varies with the latitude. To overcome this problem,
the quaternary triangular mesh (QTM) (Fig. 8.9b) has been used (e.g., Dutton 1984,
1996). The cells can be any shape (e.g., triangle, hexagon), regular or irregular.

Figure 8.9c shows the use of a regular hexagon diagram for such a tessellation. For
3D space, the voxel (volume element) is the raster equivalent for space tessellation
(Fig. 8.9d).
As the natures of the raster and vector data models are quite different, the model
for transformation in scale in these two data models might also differ. Thus, separate
subsections are devoted to these topics.

8.3.2
Space-Primary Hierarchical Models
for Transformation in Scale
Hierarchical models are popular for the multiscale representation of spatial data
at discrete scales. For example, Google Maps, Virtual Earth and Tianditu have all
adopted hierarchical models for the representation of images and maps. Figure 8.10
shows the ﬁrst three zoom levels of the hierarchical model used by Google Maps
(Stefanakis 2017). This model has a special name, the pyramid model, which is a
result of aggregating a 2 × 2 pixel into one pixel. The number of pixels (squares) at
the nth level is 4n−1. A more general form of aggregation is to transform any N × N
pixels into one pixel.
A more general form of transformation to create a hierarchical representation is
to transform N × N pixels into M × M pixels, e.g., a 5 × 5 into a 2 × 2 or a 3 × 3
into a 2 × 2. In such cases, a resampling process (instead of simple aggregation) is
required.
With a hierarchical model, the resolution and cartographic ratio at each level
are not necessarily uniform. Typical examples of hierarchical models with variable
resolutions are shown in Fig. 8.11, i.e., the quadtree and binary tree models.
With the pyramid and quadtree models, the hierarchical levels are ﬁxed and the
transformation in scale jumps from one level to another like stairs. To make the
transformation absolutely smooth, we need to make the difference between two
steps of the stairs inﬁnitely small, to make the stairs become a continuous linear
slope (see Fig. 8.12).
For hierarchical representation on a spherical surface, the Open Geospatial Con-
sortium (OGC) approved a new standard called the Discrete Global Grid System
(DGGS) (OGC 2019) The hierarchical representation of QTM as shown in Fig. 8.9b
is an example of such a DGGS.

8.3.3
Feature-Primary Hierarchical Models
for Transformation in Scale
Hierarchical models have also been used to represent point, line and area features in
feature-primary models. Figure 8.13 shows such a representation for the points on a
line. At level 1, only two points, i.e., points (1, 1) and (1, 2), will be used to represent
the line; at level 2, in addition to the two points at level 1, point 2 will also be used;
and at level 3, points (3, 1) and (3, 2) will also be used. This kind of model has been
employed for progressive transmission of vector data.
Figure 8.14 shows the hierarchical representation of a river network by the Hor-
ton and Shreve models. Figure 8.14a is a hierarchical representation based on river
segments. The formation of such a representation starts from the level 1 branches. A
segment of level 2 is formed by two or more segments of level 1. Similarly, a segment
of level 3 is formed by two or more segments of level 2. All higher level segments
are formed by following this principle. Figure 8.14b is a hierarchical representation
formed by the Horton model based on a river stroke, which is a concatenated seg-
ment. Figure 8.14c is a hierarchical representation formed by the Shreve model. The
numbering in this hierarchy is formed by adding the numbers of upstream branches.

For example, the ranking value for the segment with the highest ranking is 13, which
is a result of adding 9 and 4. Such a numbering of ranking is not continuous.
Figure 8.15 shows the hierarchical representation of two transportation networks.
In this case, the importance of each road is evaluated based on geometric information
and/or thematic information. A ranking value is assigned to each road.
Figure 8.16 shows a hierarchical representation of area features. The area features
in the whole area are ﬁrst connected by a minimum spanning tress (MST) as a
whole group, i.e., Group A. Group A is then subdivided into subgroups B and C
by breaking the tree at the connection with the largest span. Similarly, Group B is
broken into D and E, and Group C is broken into F and G. The subdivision goes on

hierarchical representation is formed.
8.3.4
Models of Transformation in Scale for Irregular
Triangulation Networks
An irregular triangulation network is an irregular space tessellation that has been
widelyusedfordigitalterrainmodels(DTMs).Insucharepresentation,theresolution
is variable across the space. Therefore, special models should be used to make the
resolution transformable from one to another. Four basic transformation models have
been developed for such a purpose (Li 2005):
• Vertex removal: A vertex in the triangular network is removed and new triangles
are formed.
• Triangle removal: A complete triangle with three vertices is removed and new
triangles are formed.
• Edge collapse: An edge with two vertices is collapsed to a point and new triangles
are formed.
• Triangle collapse: A complete triangle with three vertices is collapsed to a point
and new triangles are formed.
Figure 8.17 illustrates these four transformation models.
8.3.5
Models for Geometric Transformation of Map Data
in Scale
The hierarchical model described in Sect. 8.3.2 is suitable to represent raster image
data because images are numerical data that naturally record the earth and such a
recording follows the Natural Principle described in Sect. 8.2.3. Figure 8.18 shows
four images with different resolutions, the result of a “2 × 2 into “1 × 1” aggrega-
tion. These images appear to be very natural. However, for the categorical data of
topographic maps, such a simple transformation does not work well, and there is a
need for other transformation models.
Topographic maps are produced via a complicated intellectual process that con-
sists of abstraction, symbolization, generalization, selective omission and simpliﬁca-
tion. During this process, small details are ignored (or grouped together). All features
are represented by symbols (geometric or pictorial). The colors of the symbols are
not necessarily the natural colors of features. The graphic symbols are annotated
with text (e.g., name of a street/town/city). There are requirements for minimum
size, minimum separation and minimum differentiation for graphic elements. Thus,
when a map at a larger scale (Fig. 8.19c) is simply reduced by 4 times (equivalent to

Fig. 8.19 Kowloon Peninsula represented on maps at two different scales, via generalization and
simple scale reduction (extracted from Google Maps)
a “2 × 2 into 1” aggregation), the graphics (Fig. 8.19b) become unclear because the
minimum requirements can no longer be met. Figure 8.20 illustrates such a situation
with the aggregation of buildings as an example. A set of special models is needed
for the transformation of map data from one scale to another to make the graphics at
the smaller scale clear (Fig. 8.19a).
The transformation of maps from a larger scale to a smaller scale is called map
generalization and has long been studied in the cartographic community. Some trans-
formation models have been identiﬁed by researchers. In the traditional textbook by
Robinson et al. (1984), only four models are listed, i.e., classiﬁcation, induction,
simpliﬁcation and symbolization. In the 1980s, more models were identiﬁed, and
a list of 12 models was produced by McMaster and Shea (1992). Many of these
models were still too general to be precisely implemented in a computer system.

More recently, Li (2007) produced 40 detailed models for implementation. These
models are divided into six sets: three sets for individual points, individual lines and
individual areas and the other three sets for a class of points, a class of lines and a
class of areas. Tables 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 list the six sets of models.

Models for Transformation in Scale of 3D City
Representations
For 3D representation of digital cities, the CityGML, which was ofﬁcially adopted
by the OGC in 2008, speciﬁes ﬁve well-deﬁned consecutive levels of detail (LOD)
as follows, an example of which is shown in Fig. 8.21 (Kolbe et al. 2008):
• LOD 0—regional, landscape
• LOD 1—city, region
• LOD 2—city districts, projects
• LOD 3—architectural models (outside), landmarks
• LOD 4—architectural models (interior)
For the transformation in scale of 3D features, a set of models is listed in Table 8.7,
which is a summary of models proposed in the literature.

Mathematical Solutions for Transformations in Scale
In the previous section, several sets of models for the transformation in scale were
described. These models express what is achieved in such transformations, e.g., the
shape is simpliﬁed, important points retained, and/or the main structure is preserved.
To make these transformations work, mathematical solutions (e.g., algorithms and
mathematical functions) must be developed for each of these transformations. A
selection of these solutions is presented in this section.
8.4.1
Mathematical Solutions for Upscaling Raster Data:
Numerical and Categorical
For raster-based numerical data such as images and digital terrain models (DTMs),
aggregation is widely used to generate hierarchical models. In recent years, wavelet
transform(e.g.,Mallat1989),Laplaciantransform(BurtandAdelson1983)andother
more advanced mathematical solutions have also been employed. The commonly
used aggregation methods are by mode, by median, by average, and by Nth cell
(i.e., Nth cell in both the row and column). Figure 8.22 shows a “3 × 3 to 1 × 1”
aggregation with these four methods. The 6 × 6 grid is then aggregated into a 2 × 2
grid.
If the new cell interval is not multiples of the original cells, then interpolation
must be applied to resample the data. Bilinear and weighted averaging interpolations
are widely used for resampling. Figure 8.23 shows the resampling of a 3 × 3 grid
into a 2 × 2 grid using weighted averaging interpolation.
Bilinear interpolation can be performed for any four points (not along a line). The
mathematical function is as follows:

(b) Area-weighted interpolation
Fig. 8.23 “3 × 3 to 2 × 2” resampling of numerical data
z = a0 + a1x + a2y + a3xy
(8.3)
where a0, a1, a2, a3 is the set of four coefﬁcients, which are to be determined by four
equations that are formed by making use of the coordinates of four reference points,
i.e., the centers of the four grid cells in Fig. 8.23b: P1(x1, y1, z1), P2(x2, y2, z2),
P3(x3, y3, z3) and P4(x4, y4, z4). The mathematical formula is as follows:
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
a0
a1
a2
a3
⎤
⎥⎥⎦=
⎡
⎢⎢⎣
1 x1 y1 x1y1
1 x2 y2 x2y2
1 x3 y3 x3y3
1 x4 y4 x4y4
⎤
⎥⎥⎦
−1⎡
⎢⎢⎣
z1
z2
z3
z4
⎤
⎥⎥⎦
(8.4)
Once the coefﬁcients a0, a1, a2, a3 are computed, the height ZP of any point P
with a given set of coordinates (xP, yP) can be obtained by substituting (xP, yP) into
Eq. (8.1).
The mathematical expression of weighted averaging interpolation is as follows:
z =

n
i=1 wizi

n
i=1 wi
(8.5)
where wi is the weight of the ith reference point; zi is the height of the ith reference
point; and n is the total number of the reference points used. In the case of Fig. 8.23b,
n = 4.
Weights may be determined by using different functions. The simplest weighting
function assigns an equal weight to all reference points. However, it seems unfair to
those reference points that are closer to the interpolation point, as such points should
have a higher inﬂuence on the estimate. As a result, distance-based or area-based
weighting are more commonly used. The inverse of distance is most popularly used:
w = 1
d or w = 1
d2
(8.6)
8
Transformation in Scale for Continuous Zooming
305
where d is the distance from a reference point to the interpolation point. In the case
of interpolating the height of P in Fig. 8.23b, the four distances from the four (old)
cell centers to point P will be used. Figure 8.23b also shows that the distance of
each cell center to the interpolation point P is directly related to the size of the area
contributed by each (old) cell to the new cell. If the area size is denoted as A, the
weighting function is
wi = Ai
(8.7)
For example, if the area of the new cell is composed of 100% of the upper left
cell, 50% of the upper right cell, 50% of the lower left cell and 25% of the lower
right cell, the weights of these four cells are 1.0, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.25, and the result of
the interpolation is:
zp = 1 × 4 + 0.5 × 7 + 0.5 × 5 + 0.25 × 7)/2.25 ≈5
For the raster-based categorical data, the averaging and median are no longer
applicable. The mode (also called the majority in some literature) is still valid and
widely used. Figure 8.24b shows such a result. However, the value for the upper
right cell is difﬁcult to determine as there is no mode (majority) in the 3 × 3 window
at the upper right corner of the original data (Fig. 8.24a). Notably, some priority
rules or orders are in practical use. For example, a river feature is usually given a
priority because thin rivers are likely to be broken after aggregation. Figure 8.25
shows the improvement in the connectivity of river pixels with water as the priority.
Figure 8.24c-e show the results with different options, e.g., random selection and
central pixel. It is also possible to consider the statistical distribution of the original
data (e.g., A = 8, T = 10, W = 6, S = 11) to try to maintain the distribution as much
as possible.
In the aggregation/resampling process, as illustrated in Figs. 8.22, 8.23 and 8.24,
a moving window is used but the question of the most appropriate window size
has rarely been addressed. Li and Li (1999) suggested that the size of the moving
window for aggregation/resampling should be computed based on the resolutions

W = K
Rin
(8.8)
where Rin is the resolution (scale) of the input data; K is the SVS value in terms of
ground distance at the target scale computed by Eq. (8.1), and W is the size of the
window’s side in terms of pixel numbers (of input data).
8.4.2
Mathematical Solutions for Downscaling Raster Data
Downscaling produces a ﬁner spatial resolution raster data than that of the input
data through prediction. It is possible to use simple resampling (as described in
Sect. 8.4.1) to achieve downscaling. However, methods based on spatial statistical
analysis are more theoretically grounded and have become popular (Atkinson 2008,
2013), particularly area-to-point prediction (ATPP). Double dictionary learning has
also been used (Xu and Huang 2014).
Area-to-point kriging (ATP Kriging or ATPK) (Kyriakidis 2004) is the typical
method. ATP Kriging can ensure the coherence of predictions, such as by ensuring
that the sum of the downscaled predictions within any given area are equal to the orig-
inal aggregated count. Some variants of ATP Kriging have also been developed, e.g.,
ATP Poisson Kriging (Goovaerts 2008, 2009, 2010), indicator cokriging (Boucher
and Kyriakidis 2006) and ATP regression Kriging (Wang et al. 2015). In this section,
the base version of ATP Kriging is described.
The basic principle behind Kriging is weighted averaging. The weights are opti-
mized by using the semivariogram computed from the original data.
8
Transformation in Scale for Continuous Zooming
307
Ze,p =

wi × Zi
(8.9)
where Ze,p is the estimated (interpolated) value; Zi is the value of the ith reference
point; wi is the value of the ith reference point and 
 wi = 1.
The interpolated value Ze,p is very likely to deviate from the actual value at point
p, Za,p. The difference is called the estimation error. The variance of these deviations
is expressed by Eq. (8.10).
σ 2
z =

n
i=0(Ze,p −Za,p)2
i
n
(8.10)
The basic principle of Kriging is to produce the minimum estimation variance
by choosing a set of optimal weights. Such weights are obtained by solving a set of
simultaneous equations:
w1 × γ (d11) + w2 × γ (d12) + · · · · · · + wm × γ (d1m) + λ = γ (d1P)
w1 × γ (d21) + w2 × γ (d22) + · · · · · · + wm × γ (d2m) + λ = γ

d2p

. . . . . .
w1m × γ (dm1) + w12 × γ (dm2) + · · · · · · + w1m × γ (dmm) + λ = γ (dmP)
w1 + w2 + · · · · · · + wm = 1
(8.11)
where wi is the weight of the ith reference point; λ is the Lagrange multiplier;
and γ (d) is the semivariogram value of points with distance d apart, which can be
expressed as follows:
γ (d) =

nd
i=0(Zi −Zi+d)2
i
nd
(8.12)
In ATP Kriging, the interpolation ﬁnds an estimate for a point at higher resolution.
In such a case, a cell point at coarser resolution corresponds to an area at higher
resolution. Therefore, the set of simultaneous equations is as follows:
w1 × γ (d11) + w2 × γ (d12) + · · · · · · + wm × γ (d1m) + λ = γ (d1A)
w1 × γ (d21) + w2 × γ (d22) + · · · · · · + wm × γ (d2m) + λ = γ (d2A)
. . . . . .
w1m × γ (dm1) + w12 × γ (dm2) + · · · · · · + w1m × γ (dmm) + λ = γ (dm A)
w1 + w2 + · · · · · · + wm = 1
(8.13)
where γ (di A) is the point-to-block semivariogram value from the ith point to area A.
It is the same as the average of the point-to-point semivariogram value between the
ith point and the points within A.

Mathematical Solutions for Transformation (in Scale)
of Point Set Data
As discussed in Sect. 8.3.5, a number of transformations are possible, such as region-
alization, aggregation, selective omission, structural simpliﬁcation, and typiﬁcation.
In both aggregation and regionalization, the clustering plays a central role. In aggre-
gation, a cluster is represented by a point; in regionalization, a cluster is represented
by an area. Thus, clustering is discussed here.
Clustering is one of the most primitive activities of human beings (Anderberg
1973; Xu and Wunsch 2005). Clustering of spatial points is one of the main tasks in
digital earth such as in spatial data mining and exploratory spatial analysis (Estivill-
Castro and Lee 2002; Miller and Han 2009; Openshaw et al. 1987). Numerous
clustering methods are available. The classic algorithms are the K-means algorithms,
and the ISODATA algorithm is an important extension of K-means (Ball and Hall
1967). Classiﬁcation by K-means is achieved by minimizing the sum of the square
error over all K clusters (i.e., the objective function) as follows:
E =
K

k=1

xi∈Ck
xi −¯Ck
2
(8.14)
where ¯Ck is the mean of the cluster Ck. The procedure of this algorithm is as follows:
(1) arbitrarily select K points from data set (X) as initial cluster centroids;
(2) assign each point in X to the cluster whose centroid is closest to the point;
(3) compute the new cluster centroid for each cluster; and
(4) repeat Steps (2) and (3) until no change can be made.
However, Li et al. (2017) noted that (a) all clustering algorithms discover clusters in
a geographical dataset even if the dataset has no natural cluster structure and (b) quite
different results will be obtained with different sets of parameters for the same algo-
rithm. These two problems lead to the difﬁculty in understanding the implications of
the clustering results. Consequently, Li et al. (2017) proposed a scale-driven cluster-
ing theory. In this theory, scale is modeled as a parameter of a clustering model; the
scale dependency in the spatial clustering is handled by constructing a hypothesis
testing; and multiscale signiﬁcant clusters can be discovered by controlling the scale
parameters in an objective manner. The basic model can be written as
C = f (D, A)
(8.15)
where C is the clustering result; f is the clustering model; A is the analysis scale (the
size of clusters or the degree of homogeneity within clusters); and D is the data scale
(e.g., resolution and extent).
The clustering consists of two major tasks, i.e., estimation of the density for each
point and detection of dense regions. The procedure is as follows:

simulated dataset (Li et al. 2017)
(1) Control the data scale: Determine the SVS (smallest visible size) based on input
and output data scales and following the Natural Principle, and ignore all the
points within an SVS in the calculation of point data density.
(2) Identify high-density points: The probability density function (PDF) of the
dataset is estimated with adaptive analysis scales. The PDF are statistically
tested against a null distribution. Points with a signiﬁcantly higher density are
then identiﬁed.
(3) Group the high-density points into clusters: Clusters with different densities are
formedbyadaptivelybreakingthelongedgesinthetriangulationofhigh-density
points. The signiﬁcance of clusters obtained at multiscales can be statistically
evaluated.
Figure 8.26 shows an example of transforming a set of point data into ﬁve different
scales. When the output scale decreases (or the resolution becomes coarser), fewer
classes can be identiﬁed by this clustering technique.
8.4.4
Mathematical Solution for Transformation (in Scale)
of Individual Lines
As discussed in Sect. 8.3.5, there are eight different types of transformation for
individual lines and the algorithms/mathematical solutions for the transformation
models are discussed in detail by Li (2007). In this section, two classic algorithms
are described in detail, i.e., the Douglas–Peucker algorithm (Douglas and Peucker
1973) and the Li–Openshaw algorithm (Li and Openshaw 1992).

Fig. 8.27 Douglas–Peucker algorithm for generation of a point hierarchy
In Fig. 8.13, a hierarchical representation of the points on a line is presented.
The order of these points is sorted by the Douglas–Peucker algorithm. The working
principle of this algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 8.27. A curve line is given with an
ordered set of points, and a distance tolerance ε (> 0) is set. The basic idea is to
use a straight line connecting the ﬁrst and last points to represent the curve line if
the deviations from all line points to the straight line are smaller than ε. In this case,
only the two end points are selected and all middle points are regarded as being
insigniﬁcant and can be removed.
The algorithm ﬁrst selects two end points (i.e., the ﬁrst and last points). It then
searches for the point that has the largest deviation from the straight-line segment
connecting these two end points, i.e., at point 2 in Fig. 8.27. If the deviation is larger
than ε, then this point is selected; otherwise, all other points can be ignored. In this
example, point 2 is selected and it splits the line into two pieces. The search is then
carried out for both pieces. Then, points (3, 1) and (3, 2) are selected. These two
points split the whole line into four pieces, and the search will be carried out for
these four pieces. The process continues until all the deviations are smaller than ε.
Visvalingham and Whyatt (1993) and Li (2007) noted that the Douglas–Peucker
algorithm may cause huge shape distortion. To overcome this problem, Visvalingham
and Whyatt (1993) believed that the size of an area “sets a perceptual limit on the
signiﬁcance” and is the most reliable metric for measuring the importance of points
since it simultaneously considers the distance between points and angular measures.
They used the effective area of a point as the threshold, as illustrated in Fig. 8.28.
For example, the effective area of point 2 is the area covered by the triangle formed

by points 1, 2 and 3. The basic idea of this algorithm is to progressively eliminate
the point with smallest effective area from the list, and the effective areas of the two
points adjoining the recently deleted point should be immediately updated. In this
example, point 11 is ﬁrst eliminated and point 13 is removed. The points are ranked
from least to most important according to the sequence of elimination.
Many researchers (Li and Openshaw 1992; Visvalingham and Whyatt 1993;
Weibel 1996) have noted that the Douglas–Peucker algorithm will create self-
intersection (with the line itself) and cross-intersections (between neighboring lines).
This problem is associated with all the algorithms with an objective of point reduction
or curve approximation. Li and Openshaw (1992) argued that these algorithms are not
suitable for generalization (i.e., transformation in scale) because they are normally
evaluated with the original curve line (but do not correspond with the curve line at
other scales) as the benchmark. To perform transformation in scale for line features,
the Li–Openshaw algorithm should be employed as this algorithm, “by virtue of its
raster structure, implicitly (but not explicitly) avoids self-overlaps” (Weibel 1996).
Even for a very complex coastline, it can produce results that are extremely similar to
those manually generalized to various scales, as illustrated by Fig. 8.29. Many recent
evaluations also indicate that the Li–Openshaw algorithm produces reasonable and
genuine results (e.g., Zhu et al. 2007).
The Li–Openshaw algorithm follows the Natural Principle (Li and Openshaw
1993) described in Sect. 8.2.3, i.e., to neglect all spatial variations within the SVS
that is computed by using input and output scales. The SVS is mimicked by a cell or

pixel although other geometric elements are also possible (e.g., hexagon by Raposo
in 2013). The cells can be organized in the form of a none overlapped tessellation or
with overlaps. If there is no overlap, it becomes a pure raster template. Figure 8.30
shows the generalization (transformation) process with a raster template. In this
example, each SVS is represented by a raster pixel and the result is represented by
pixels, as shown in Fig. 8.30b, or by its geometric center.
Three algorithms were developed by Li and Openshaw (1993) in different modes,
raster node, vector mode and raster-vector mode. The algorithm in raster-vector
mode was recommended. Figure 8.31 shows the generalization by the Li–Openshaw
algorithm in raster-vector mode. The ﬁrst point to be recorded is the starting point.

the last (outlet direction) intersections are used to determine the position of the new
point ((Fig. 8.31c). The ﬁnal result of the generalization of a complete line is given
in Fig. 8.31d.
Similartothealgorithminrastermode,overlapbetweenSVSscanalsobeadopted,
although it is not too critical. Notably, it is not necessary to take the average to
represent a cell. It does not matter what point within the cell is used, as the cell itself
is an SVS. Thus, it is also possible to take an original point, which is considered a
critical point to represent the cell.
Some work has also been carried out to downscale the lines, i.e., to add more
details to the lines. A typical example of such work is that by Dutton (1981), which
adds more details to the line by following the fractal characteristics of the line itself
(see Fig. 8.32).
8.4.5
Mathematical Solutions for Transformation (in Scale)
of Line Networks
In geographical space, three types of line networks are commonly used, contour line
networks, hydrological networks and transportation networks. Some hierarchical
models were presented in Sect. 8.3.3. The mathematical solutions for the transfor-
mation in scale of these networks are discussed in detail by Li (2007). Here, only the
construction of a hierarchy for transportation networks is described.
The ﬁrst approach is based on the importance of roads. As road networks are
stored in segments and intersections in a database, two steps are required, to build
strokes and to order strokes, as illustrated in Fig. 8.33. To build strokes means to
concatenate continuous and smooth network segments (see Fig. 8.33a) into a whole
(see Fig. 8.33b). To order strokes means to rank the strokes in a descending order
based on their importance from high to low (see Fig. 8.33b). The importance of
each stroke can be calculated according to various properties, i.e., geometric prop-
erties such as length (Chaudhry and Mackaness 2005), topological properties such

as degree, closeness and/or betweenness (Jiang and Claramunt 2004), and thematic
properties such as road class. A comparative analysis of the methodology for building
strokes was carried by Zhou and Li (2012). With each stroke, given an importance,
a stroke-based hierarchy of a line network can be built.
The importance of strokes can be evaluated by the connectivity of strokes in
the network. ego-network analysis and weighted ego-network analysis are possible
methods (Zhang and Li 2011). Figure 8.34 shows the basic structure of three types of
ego-networks and the weight of each link, also called the proportional link strength.
The proportional link strength of each link (pij) from node i to any of its immediate
neighbor nodes can be deﬁned as the reciprocal of the degree of connectivity (k) of
node i. Mathematically,
pi j = 1

316
Z. Li and H. Yan
For instance, in Fig. 8.34a, the ego is connected to both alter1 and alter2, so its
degree of connectivity is 2; thus, the strengths of links from this ego to alter1 and to
alter2 are both 1/2 = 0.5. The strengths of other links are also indicated in Fig. 8.34.
If node i and node j are not directly linked but are linked via another node q in the
neighbor (ne), the strength of the link from node i to node j (i.e., pij) is deﬁned as:
p
′
i j = piq pqj
(8.17)
The total link strength (Cij) from node i to node j is deﬁned as the square of the
sum of the direct link strength and the indirect link strength from node i to node j.
Mathematically,
Ci j =

pi j +

=
⎛
⎝pi j +

⎞
⎠
2
(8.18)
The Cij value reveals the constraint of i by j. The larger the C value is, the larger
the constraint over i, and the smaller the opportunity for i.
To apply this concept to a transport network, the physical road network is ﬁrst
concerted into a connectivity graph, and the link strength values are computed for
each node in the connectivity graph. Figure 8.35 shows an example. Roads can then
be ranked by the link strength values.
The ego-network is a feasible and effective solution for the formation of hierar-
chies for road networks. However, Zhang and Li (2011) identiﬁed two signiﬁcant
limitations, the deviation of the link intensity deﬁnition from reality and the so-called
‘degree 1 effect’. They subsequently developed a weighted ego-network analysis
method.
Another important development is the mesh density-based approach proposed by
Chen et al. (2009). The so-called mesh is a closed region surrounded by several road
segments. In this approach, the density of each mesh in the road network is computed
according to the following formula:

where P is the perimeter of the mesh and A is the area of the mesh.
Then, the meshes with the highest density are merged progressively, as illustrated
in Fig. 8.36. In this Figure, the mesh with density of 0.64 is ﬁrst merged into the that
with a density of 0.42 and segment L is eliminated. The density (0.32) of the new
mesh is then updated. The process is iterated until only one mesh is left.
Generally, a road network is often a hybrid of linear and areal patterns, thus Li
and Zhou (2012) proposed the construction of hybrid hierarchies, i.e., an integration
of a line hierarchy and an area hierarchy.
8.4.6
Mathematical Solutions for Transformation of a Class
of Area Features
Section 8.3.5 described how a hierarchy of areas could be structured by a minimum
spanning tree. In that example, the centroid of a polygon was used to represent the
polygon. However, if the polygon is thin and/or irregular, then the edge length is not
necessarily a good measure for closeness. Densiﬁcation of points along the polygon
edge will make the problem simpler. Figure 8.37 shows such an example. Figure 8.38
shows the transformation of buildings into suitable representations at different scales.
Li (1994) argued that the transformation in scale should be better performed in
raster space (because a scale reduction causes a space reduction and the raster format
takes care of space) and proposed the use of techniques in mathematical morphology
for transformation in scale. Li et al. have developed a complete set of algorithms for
such transformations based on mathematical morphology.
One such algorithm is the aggregation of areas into groups and transformation
into representations at different scales (Su et al. 1997). The mathematical model for
the aggregation is:
C = (A ⊕B1)  B2
(8.20)
where A is the representation (image) showing the original area features and B1 and
B2 are the two structuring elements.

The success of applying this model to area combination depends on the proper
size and shape of the structuring elements B1 and B2. Su et al. (1997) suggest that
the size of B1 and B2 should be determined by the input and output scales, following
the Natural Principle described in Sect. 8.2.3. Figure 8.39 shows the combination of

buildings using this model for two different scales: one for a scale reduction by 7
times and the other by 10 times. The results are also compared with those using simple
photoreduction. The combined results are very reasonable. However, the combined
results are very irregular and the simpliﬁcation of boundaries could be discussed. A
detailed description of such a simpliﬁcation is omitted here but can be found in the
work of Su et al. (1997) and the book by Li (2007). The result is shown in Fig. 8.40.
8.4.7
Mathematical Solutions for Transformation (in Scale)
of Spherical and 3D Features
In the previous sections, mathematical solutions for transformation of 2D features
have been presented. Mathematical solutions for transformation of spherical (e.g.,
Dutton1999)and3Dfeatures(e.g.,Anders2005)havealsobeenresearched,although
the body of literature is much smaller than that for map generalization. In recent years,
there have been more papers on the generalization of buildings-based CityGML (e.g.,
Fan and Meng 2012, Uyar and Ulugtekin 2017); details on such methodologies are
omitted here due to page limitations.
8.5
Transformation in Scale: Final Remarks
The beginning of this chapter emphasized that continuous zooming is at the core of
Digital Earth as initiated by Al Gore. Continuous zooming is a kind of transforma-
tion of spatial representation in scale. In this chapter, the theoretical foundation for
transformations in scale was presented in Sect. 8.2. Then, models for such transfor-
mations were described in Sect. 8.3 for raster and vector data, images, digital terrain
models and map data. A selection of algorithms and/or mathematical functions for
achieving these transformations was presented in Sect. 8.4.
Notably, the content of this chapter was concentrated on the theories and method-
ology to achieve continuous zooming and some important issues related to transfor-
mation in scale have been omitted, such as temporal scale, scale effect and optimum
scale selection. For the content of the models for transformation in scale, emphasis

was on the representations. Thus, other models such as geographical and environ-
mental processes were excluded. However, these aspects are important but were
omitted due to page limitations.

Abstract Big data emerged as a new paradigm to provide unprecedented content
and value for Digital Earth. Big Earth data are increasing tremendously with growing
heterogeneity, posing grand challenges for the data management lifecycle of storage,
processing, analytics, visualization, sharing, and applications. During the same time
frame, cloud computing emerged to provide crucial computing support to address
these challenges. This chapter introduces Digital Earth data sources, analytical meth-
ods, and architecture for data analysis and describes how cloud computing supports
big data processing in the context of Digital Earth.

Introduction
Digital Earth refers to the virtual representation of the Earth we live in. It represents
the Earth in the digital world from data to model. Data are collected and models are
abstracted to build the digital reality. Massive amounts of data are generated from
various sensors deployed to observe our home planet while building Digital Earth.
The term “big data” was ﬁrst presented by NASA researchers to describe the massive
amount of information that exceeds the capacities of main memory, local disk, and
even remote disk (Friedman 2012). According to the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), “Big Data is a term used to describe the large amount of
data in the networked, digitized, sensor-laden, information-driven world” (Chang
and Grady 2015). This deﬁnition refers to the bounty of digital data from various
data sources in the context of Digital Earth, which focus on big data’s geographical
aspects of social information, Earth observation (EO), sensor observation service
(SOS), cyber infrastructure (CI), social media and business information (Guo 2017;
Guo et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2017a, b). Digital Earth data are collected from satellites,

Table 9.1 Deﬁnition of the “9Vs” of big data
“V”
Deﬁnition
Volume
The vast data size that traditional data storage and computing technologies
cannot easily capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage and present
Variety
The diversity of data formats and sources. The data formats include text,
geometries, images, video, sounds or a combination
Velocity
The speed of data production, storage, analysis, and visualization based on
advanced development of data collection methods, i.e., the massive number of
sensors in the Interest of Things (IoT) and social media networks
Veracity
The varying reliability, accuracy, or quality of data sources
Validity
The accuracy and correctness of Earth data for the intended usage
Variability
The meaning of data continues to change, particularly for Earth data that relies
on natural language processing
Vulnerability
Data security is an important part of typical and big Earth data because some
geospatial data contain identiﬁcation information related to people or
governments
Volatility
The timeliness and freshness of Earth data
Visualization
Visualization of Earth data is challenging with limited memory, poor scalability
and functionality, and various data increasing at a high velocity
Value
Value reﬂects the tremendous straightforward and potential scientiﬁc and social
worth based on imaginative insight and analysis results
sensors, simulation models, mobile phones, utilities, vehicles, and social networks
in different formats, e.g., imagery, text, video, sound, geometries and combinations
of them (Yang et al. 2017a, b). Digital Earth data are naturally big data because of
the variety of data sources and enormous data volume.
The increasing availability of big Earth data has provided unprecedented oppor-
tunities to understand the Earth in the Digital Earth context. In recent research, big
data have been characterized by 5 Vs (volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value)
(Gantz and Reinsel 2011; Zikopoulos and Barbas 2012; Marr 2015). Firican (2017)
extended the 5 Vs into big data characteristics including variability, validity, vulner-
ability, volatility and visualization (as deﬁned in Table 9.1 and further elaborated
below).
Volume
The volume of remote sensing imagery collected by satellites and drones easily
reaches the TB and PB levels. For example, the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals
for GPM (IMERG) data product records global precipitation information every half
hour, producing up to 3.45 TB data yearly (Huffman et al. 2015). Other location-
based data such as social media (e.g., Twitter) and VGI (e.g., OpenStreetMap) are
constantly growing.
9
Big Data and Cloud Computing
327
Variety
Data sources include sensors, digitizers, scanners, numerical models, mobile phones,
the Internet, videos, emails, and social networks in the context of Digital Earth. All
types of geospatial data require a more effective data structure, framework, index,
model, management methodology, and tactics. In addition, these geospatial data are
formatted in various data models, e.g., vector and raster, structured and unstructured.
Velocity
The speed of Earth data collection and generation has increased with the develop-
ment of advanced techniques such as drone observation for disaster monitoring. For
example, with the massive number of object-based sensors in the IoT, the data gen-
eration of IoT nodes is fast since most sensors continuously generate data in real
time.
Veracity
The accuracy of geospatial data varies by data source (Li et al. 2016). Taking pre-
cipitation as an example, the quality of remote sensing images such as TRMM and
IMERG depends on the sensor conﬁguration, calibration methods, and retrieval algo-
rithms. Precipitation information in MERRA (Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for
Research and Applications) data relies on the sophistication of meteorological mod-
els. Stationary data collected by rain gauges are more accurate even though they are
sparse.
Validity
Similar to veracity, validity concerns the accuracy and correctness of Earth data
for the intended usage. In addition to data selection in which data are chosen with
appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions and variables for a speciﬁc application,
data preprocessing, e.g., data augmentation, interpolation, outlier detection, also
play an important role in uncovering information from big Earth data. Consistent
data quality, common deﬁnitions and metadata can beneﬁt the community, resulting
in Earth data of high validity.
Variability
Variability refers to the continuous change in the meaning of data in the context of big
Earth data, particularly for data that relies on natural language processing. For exam-
ple, Twitter data emerged as an additional source for natural disaster management
(Yu et al. 2018), as tweets posted during disasters can be collected to aid situational
awareness. The meaning of words constantly changes over time, for example, the
word “Irma” may be a name but started to represent the strongest observed hurricane
in the Atlantic in most tweets around October 2017.
Vulnerability
Security is a challenging aspect because some geospatial data contain identiﬁable
information or are sensitive. For example, cellular data have been widely utilized to
analyze human activities in smart city applications, however, showing phone numbers
may divulge people’s private affairs.
328
Y. Li et al.
Volatility
Volatility refers to the timeliness and freshness of Earth data, i.e., how long the Earth
data stay useful and relevant to applications and how long the data should be kept.
Due to the velocity and volume of big Earth data, it is impossible to store all the
data in a live database without any performance issues. A series of rules should be
established for data currency, availability and rapid retrieval (Firican 2017), e.g.,
historical and less frequently visited Earth data could be archived on a lower-cost
tier of storage.
Visualization
Visualization of Earth data is a challenging task with limited memory due to poorly
scalable, low-functionality, and high-velocity datasets. Traditional methods may fail
torenderbillionsofpoints,polylinesandpolygonswhenvisualizinggeospatialvector
data, therefore graphical methods, e.g., data clustering, parallel coordinates, cone tree
or circular network diagrams, should be used to represent Earth data (Firican 2017).
Value
Value presents a low-density pattern in the current big data ecosystem where only a
small portion of data is utilized in practice. Earth data occupies 80%+ of our data
assets (Dempsey 2012), but most datasets are not excavated and are under-utilized.
With appropriate spatiotemporal resolution and analysis methods, the 9Vs have been
addressed to obtain actionable knowledge to increase the value of big data.
Data collection strategies, data storage facilities, data analysis methods, and data
access services facilitate the transformation from the other 9Vs to the 10th V of
value. With the continuing increases in the volume and complexity of data, there are
challenges in the life cycle of data management, including data storage, data query,
data analysis, data sharing, and many other aspects. Managing big data requires an
extensible, interoperable and scalable architecture that supports data storage and
analysis. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the evolution of cloud computing,
which brings potential solutions to support the life cycle of big data management.
Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm for delivering computation as
a ﬁfth utility, which became popular earlier than big data (Yang et al. 2011a). It
has the features of elasticity, pooled resources, on-demand access, self-service and
pay-as-you-go characteristics (Mell and Grance 2011) and was termed spatial cloud
computing in the context of Digital Earth (Yang et al. 2011a). Big data technologies,
e.g., big data storage and big data analytics, evolve and beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from
their integration with cloud computing.
To provide a comprehensive overview of how cloud computing supports big data
in the context of Digital Earth, this chapter introduces Digital Earth data sources
(Sect. 9.2), data analysis methods (Sect. 9.3), architecture for big data analysis
(Sect. 9.4), and cloud computing and its support of big data management (Sect. 9.5).
Two examples of EarthCube and Data Cube are introduced in Sect. 9.6 to exemplify
cloud-based big data frameworks in the Digital Earth context.

Big Data Sources
With the advanced developments in Earth observation systems, various Earth data
have been gathered at a high velocity from ﬁve major sources: (1) remote sensing, (2)
in situ sensing, (3) simulation, (4) social media, and (5) infrastructure management
(Fig. 9.1). Each covers more than one characteristic of big data. This section discusses
the ﬁve data sources.
Remote sensing data
Referring to the USGS’s deﬁnition, remote sensing is the process of detecting and
monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring the reﬂected and
Fig. 9.1 Big Earth data sources: a remote sensing data (JPL 2001); b in situ data (NOAA 2017);
c simulation data (Lipponen 2017); d social media data (Gundersen 2013); and e infrastructure data
(Canada Line Vancouver Transit Map 2019; Robert 2000)

Y. Li et al.
emitted radiation at a distance from the targeted area (USGS 2019). Such remotely
observed data serve as a vital source for tracking natural phenomena, the growth
of a city, changes in farmland or forest, and discovery of the rugged topography
of the ocean ﬂoor. According to the Earth Observing System Data and Information
System (EOSDIS) 2014 statistics, EOSDIS manages over 9 PB of data and adds
6.4 TB of data to its archives every day (NASA 2016). As data precision and den-
sity increase over time, data volume increases exponentially. In addition, ongoing
international initiatives monitor the Earth in near-real time using satellites to support
rapid data collection for quick and effective emergency response (Zhang and Kerle
2008). Remote sensing data are big data due to the big volume, variety, veracity and
volatility.
In situ data
According to NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), in situ
data are measurements made at the actual location of the object. In contrast to remote
sensing, in situ sensing harvests data directly at the observation location, and often
provides continuous data streams to reﬂect the actual situation with very low latency.
Examples of such measurements are (1) tall tower networks (NOAA ESRL/GMD)
that provide regionally representative measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
related gases and (2) moored and drifting buoys for marine/ocean data collection. In
situ data are big data considering the volume, velocity, and veracity.
Simulation data
Simulation datasets or reanalysis datasets refer to the outputs of Earth models (e.g.,
climate) based on geophysical principles. By assimilating observations with models,
better initial conditions can be leveraged and simulation results can be signiﬁcantly
improved, especially for short-term predictions. Simulation datasets can be used in
various applications. For example, the precipitation, evaporation, and runoff from
MERRA datasets can drive river ﬂow models and enhance the study of sensitive
ecosystems such as estuaries (Rienecker et al. 2011). In addition, the reanalysis
winds used in transport models support the evaluation of aerosols. Simulation data
are big data due to its volume, variety and validity.
Social media data
In recent years, social media has become one of the most popular sources of big
data and provides valuable insights on event trends and people’s references. Social
networks such as Twitter and Facebook generate a vast amount of geo-tagged data
every second and are transforming social sciences (Yang et al. 2017a). Scientists from
economics, political science, social science, and geoscience domains utilize big data
mining methods to detect social interactions and analyze health records, phone logs,
and government records (Balakrishna 2012). For example, in Digital Earth, social
media and crowdsourcing data can provide trends of the urban ﬂooding events or
wildﬁre spread, as well as support near-real time situational awareness when other
types of data are limited or hard to obtain. However, social media data have high
uncertainty and vary in format and quality. Tweet content analysis highly relies on
natural language processing, but word meaning constantly changes. Social media

data are big data due to its volume, velocity, variety, veracity, validity, variability and
volatility.
Infrastructure data
Infrastructure data serve as a vital data source of Digital Earth information, espe-
cially for developing smart cities. For example, basic infrastructure data (e.g., utility,
transportation, and energy), healthcare data and governance data (e.g., environmental
and construction management) should be proposed, planned and provided by local
ofﬁcial departments and business agencies for a smart city (Hashem et al. 2016).
Some infrastructure data may contain sensitive information. Taking water distribu-
tion management systems as an example, a synthetic data methodology was proposed
to reproduce water consumption data according to privacy constraints (Koﬁnas et al.
2018). With the upgrades in infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT) data, geo-tagged
or geo-referenced data are continuously produced by various devices, sensors, sys-
tems and services (Boulos and Al-Shorbaji 2014). In the near future, various appli-
cations based on IoT data will beneﬁt individuals and society. For example, near-real
time data including temperature and wind information gathered by IoT sensors could
support real-time urban microclimate analysis (Rathore et al. 2017). Infrastructure
data are big data due to its volume, velocity, variety, veracity, vulnerability, validity
and volatility.
Earth data are continuing to grow in volume and complexity. Big data analytical
methods are utilized to mine actionable knowledge from big Earth data to convert
the 9Vs of Earth data to the 10th V, which is discussed in the next section.
9.3
Big Data Analysis Methods
The advancements in remote sensing, social networking, high-performance simula-
tionmodelingandinsitumonitoringprovideunprecedentedbigdataaboutourplanet.
The large volume and variety of data offer an opportunity to better understand the
Earth by extracting pieces of knowledge from these data. This section discusses data
analysis methods from the three aspects of data preprocessing, statistical analysis
and nonstatistical analysis. The characteristics, applications, and challenges of these
methods are introduced below.
9.3.1
Data Preprocessing
Real-world data are usually incomplete, noisy and inconsistent due to data collection
limitations and sensor issues. Raw data may contain errors or outliers, lack speciﬁc
attributes or have discrepancies in the descriptions. Therefore, data preprocessing
(e.g., data cleaning, fusion, transformation, and reduction) are required to remove
noise, correct data, or reduce data size.
332
Y. Li et al.
Low-quality values (missing values, outliers, noises, inconsistent values) in raw
data are often removed or replaced with user-generated values, e.g., interpolation
values. The missing value is usually represented with a symbol (e.g., N/A) in raw
data and easily recognize. Outliers and inconsistent values are hidden in the raw
data and can be detected through statistical analysis. Taking water usage behavior
analysis as an example, data preprocessing is necessary to turn smart water meter
data into useful water consumption patterns because IoT sensors may fail to record
data (Söderberg and Dahlström 2017).
Data transformation also plays an essential role in data preprocessing. Multiple
Digital Earth data, e.g., climate data, soil moisture data, crop data, are converted to
monthly z-score data before analysis to eliminate the seasonal trends that usually
make the patterns of interest undiscoverable. Aggregation, another important data
transformation method, groups data based on numerical attributes (Heuvelink and
Pebesma 1999). In the Earth science domain, aggregating raw data to the county or
state levels could uncover essential patterns for decision making, urban planning,
and regional development.
Another trend in Digital Earth data analysis is multisource data fusion, which pro-
vides comprehensive data retrieved from several data sources. Generally, vector and
raster data store Earth information with different spatial-temporal resolutions; thus,
data must be converted to the same resolution by interpolating the lower resolution
data or aggregating the higher resolution data for intelligent analysis to investigate
scientiﬁc questions at a speciﬁc scale. Sharifzadeh and Shahabi (2004) introduced a
spatial aggregation method that takes the sensor data distribution into account. Spa-
tial interpolation is interpolation of point and areal data. Point interpolation is applied
to contour mapping and areal interpolation is used in isopleth mapping (Lam 1983).
In addition to spatial interpolation, temporal interpolation predicts values between
timestamps (Lepot et al. 2017).
9.3.2
Statistical Analysis
In the era of big data, statistical analysis is a common mathematical method of
information extraction and discovery. Statistical methods are mathematical formulas,
models, and techniques used to ﬁnd patterns and rules from raw data (Schabenberger
and Gotway 2017). Data mining is the process of discovering patterns from large
datasets involving statistical analysis. Through data mining, historical data can be
transformed into knowledge to predict relevant phenomena. Both traditional statistics
and data mining methods are discussed in this section. These methods include but
are not limited to regression analysis, spatiotemporal analysis, association rules,
classiﬁcation, clustering, and deep learning.
Regression analysis
Regression models the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more
explanatory variables (Yoo et al. 2014; Anderson 2015) by estimating the values of
9
Big Data and Cloud Computing
333
a dependent variable when the values of the independent variables are known and
the relationships exist. Regression models describe the strength or weakness of the
relationship between several variables. For example, Blachowski (2016) proposed a
weighted spatial regression method that identiﬁed four signiﬁcant factors inducing
land subsidence: thickness, inclination, the depth of coal panels, and the slope of
the surface. There are challenges in spatial data analysis using regression methods,
especially for situations that are complicated enough to result in serious residuals in
the regression models.
Spatiotemporal analysis
Spatiotemporal data analysis investigates the trajectories and trends of spatiotem-
poral data. Li et al. (2016) investigated the spatiotemporal trends in the ﬂuctuations
of housing price data. Spatial data analytics and modeling techniques were used to
identify the spatial distribution of housing prices at the micro level and explore the
space-time dynamics of residential properties in the market, as well as the detected
geographic disparity in terms of housing prices. Rahman and Lateh (2017) analyzed
the temperature and rainfall time series data from 34 meteorological stations dis-
tributed throughout Bangladesh over 40 years (1971–2010) to statistically evaluate
the magnitude of temperature and rainfall changes across space and time. Spatiotem-
poral analysis is still in its initial stage of development. Challenging questions remain,
such as what kinds of patterns can be extracted from time series data and which meth-
ods and algorithms should be applied.
Association rule
Association rule learning is the process of discovering strong relationships between
variables, i.e., rules, in a large database using measurements of support and conﬁ-
dence (Agrawal et al. 1993). In Digital Earth, Yang (2011b, 2016) applied association
rules to mine the variables of Atlantic hurricanes from 1980 to 2003 and discovered
a combination of factors related to rapid intensiﬁcation probability, the low vertical
shear of the horizontal wind (SHRD = L), high humidity in the 850–700 hPa range
(RHLO = H), and tropical cyclones in an intensiﬁcation phase (PD12 = H). Com-
pared with traditional statistical methods, the rule-based mining method can ﬁnd
combinations of factors instead of a single factor related to an event.
Classiﬁcation
Classiﬁcation learning is the task of mapping input variables to discrete output vari-
ables called labels or categories, for example, ‘building’ or ‘road.’ It is the process
of recognizing, differentiating and understanding objects. Support Vector Machine
(SVM) is a classical classiﬁcation algorithm in which a kernel-based metric is used
to differentiate objects. Jiang et al. (2018b) integrated the ranking support vector
machine (RankSVM) model from the computer science community with ocean data
attributes to support data ranking in ocean portals. An SVM model is also used to
predict geological lithofacies from wireline logs.
Clustering
Clustering is the process of splitting a set of objects into closely related groups, and
each group is regarded as a cluster. Objects falling in the same cluster are more
334
Y. Li et al.
similar to each other than those in other clusters. In Digital Earth, clustering plays an
important role in pattern analysis. Hong and O’Sullivan (2012) clustered empirical
datasets in Auckland, New Zealand for ethnic residential cluster detection, which is
useful to understand contemporary immigrants and ethnic minorities in urban areas.
Zhao et al. (2017) proposed a method to generate urban road intersection models
from low-frequency GPS trajectory data. These patterns identiﬁed from empirical
data are crucial for urban transportation planning and management.
Deep learning
As a new paradigm of machine learning, deep learning has achieved remarkable suc-
cess in discovery of implicit knowledge (LeCun et al. 2015). In Digital Earth, deep
learning algorithms have been adopted to solve domain problems. For example, Guo
and Feng (2018) used multiscale and hierarchical deep convolutional features to
assign meaningful semantic labels to the points in a three-dimensional (3D) point
cloud, which is essential for generating 3D models. Li and Hsu (2018) proposed a
deep learning approach to automatically identify terrain features (i.e., sand dunes,
craters) from remote sensing imagery. Compared with traditional induction-based
approaches, the deep learning approach could detect diverse and complex terrain
features more accurately and process massive available geospatial data more efﬁ-
ciently.
9.3.3
Nonstatistical Analysis
Inadditiontostatisticalanalysis,nonstatisticalanalysismethodsalsoplayanessential
role in helping us descriptively understand Earth phenomena. This section introduces
two representative models in Digital Earth, linked data and 3D city modeling.
Linked data
Linked data are structured data in which datasets are interlinked in the collection,
which is useful for semantic queries and reasoning (Bizer et al. 2011). With linked
data, data are sharable, and the relationships among the data are recorded. Standard
web technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) provide a way
to build shareable linked data. In Digital Earth, heterogeneous Earth data (multidis-
ciplinary, multitemporal, multiresolution, and multilingual) can be integrated based
on linked data principles for decision making and knowledge discovery (Vilches-
Blázquez et al. 2014). For example, Mc Cutchan (2017) proposed a structure of
embedding geographic data into linked data and forecasted spatial phenomena with
associated rules extracted from the linked data.
3D city modeling
A trend in Digital Earth analysis is to build a real 3D model with the aid of a
computer, especially for cities where most human activities occur. 3D models provide
real three-dimensional information for analysis, going beyond simple visualization
of 3D objects. 3D informatics has become a cornerstone for a series of city-related

applicationssuchasurbanplanning,skylineanalysis,crisisanddisastermanagement,
route selection and navigation (El-Mekawy 2010). For example, Amirebrahimi et al.
(2016) assessed and visualized ﬂood damage using 3D urban modeling and a building
information model (BIM), improving the resilience of the community to ﬂoods using
detailed 3D information.
Knowledge distillation from Earth data has demonstrated excellent improvements
in our understanding of the planet we live. As Earth data increase faster than ever,
state-of-the-artanalysismethodsshouldbedevelopedtohandletheincreasinglycom-
plicated spatiotemporal data. In addition, an extensible, interoperable and scalable
architecture is a prerequisite for massive geographic data analysis, and we present a
big data analysis architecture in the next section.
9.4
Architecture for Big Data Analysis
To support Earth data access/query/analysis in a reasonable response time, it is crucial
to build a sophisticated analytical platform with robust architecture to reveal insights
from the data (Yang et al. 2017a, b). Generally, the architecture of analytical platforms
consists of a data storage layer, a data query layer, a data processing layer, and a
visualization layer (Fig. 9.2).
Fig. 9.2 Architecture for big data analyses

Y. Li et al.
9.4.1
Data Storage Layer
Digital Earth is heavily involved in processing big data from Earth observations
and model simulations, and these vast amounts of high-dimensional array-based
spatiotemporal data pose challenges for data storage (Li et al. 2017b). Customizations
are indispensable in integrating advanced data storage technologies with big Earth
data storage, as general distributed ﬁle systems such as Hadoop are not designed to
store spatiotemporal data.
A robust and stable data storage framework is the foundation of the data analysis
architecture. A series of research efforts focused on optimizing spatiotemporal data
storage in distributed ﬁle systems or databases. For example, Hu et al. (2018a) reor-
ganized NetCDF (Rew and Davis 1990), a standard data format for array-based raster
data, into CSV ﬁles and deployed them within SciDB (Cudre-Mauroux et al. 2009),
a scalable multidimensional array clustering database. Zhao et al. (2010) converted
NetCDF data into CDL (network Common data form Description Language) ﬁles and
distributed them on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). MERRA data, which
store reanalysis Earth climatic variables in NetCDF format, were transformed into
Hadoop Sequence Files to be processed by standard MapReduce functions (Duffy
et al. 2012). Li et al. (2015) decomposed array-based raster data and stored them
with HBase, a NoSQL database built upon HDFS in a cloud computing environment
for efﬁcient data access and query.
To enable efﬁcient big data query, logical query capabilities have been proposed
to support spatiotemporal query of array-based models such as SciHadoop (Buck
et al. 2011). A spatiotemporal index was designed to efﬁciently retrieve and process
big array-based raster data using MapReduce and a grid partition algorithm atop
the index to optimize the MapReduce performance (Li et al. 2017a). SciHive was
developed as an extension of Hadoop Hive, mapping arrays in NetCDF ﬁles to a table
and calculating the value range for each HDFS to build a distributed adaptive index
(Geng et al. 2013, 2014). Malik (2014) introduced a Z-region index into GeoBase to
facilitate array-based data storage.
9.4.2
Data Query Layer
To help data consumers efﬁciently discover data from the massive available Earth
data, the Digital Earth communities have built various data portals to improve the
discovery, access, and usability of Earth data. The portals are normally supported
by text search and spatiotemporal search and include the GeoPortal,1 GeoNetwork2
Spatial Web Portal (Xu et al. 2011), Global Earth Observation System of Systems
GEOSS Clearinghouse (Liu et al. 2011; Nativi et al. 2015; Giuliani et al. 2017),

GeoSearch (Lui et al. 2013) and many others. For example, GEOSS is a cloud-
based framework for global and multidisciplinary Earth observation data sharing,
discovery, and access (Nativi et al. 2015). In the framework, datasets or workﬂows
are registered into shared collections or global catalogs, allowing for end users to
search for workﬂows and datasets across multiple granularity levels and disciplines.
In addition, open-source information retrieval frameworks, e.g., Apache Lucene
or its variants such as Solr and Elasticsearch (McCandless et al. 2010), were adopted
to establish an Earth data portal instead of implementing a search engine for Earth
data from scratch. Lucene uses the Boolean model and the practical scoring function
to match documents to a query. Solr and Elasticsearch improve the Lucene index to
enable big data search capabilities. The Physical Oceanography Distributed Active
Archive Center (PO. DAAC) serves the oceanographic community with 514 col-
lection level datasets and massive granule level data atop Solr (Jiang et al. 2018a).
Elasticsearch is the fundamental component of NOAA’s OneStop portal in which data
providers manage data and metadata with increased discoverability and accessibility.
However, solely relying on open source solutions is insufﬁcient for Earth data
discovery because these solutions only rely on a keyword-based relevance score for
ranking and ignore other user preferences, e.g., data processing level, sensor type.
A few related research efforts have been conducted in the Earth science domain to
make data search engines smarter and more intelligent. For example, an algorithm
combing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and a two-tier ranking was reported to
build a semantic-enabled data search engine (Li et al. 2014a, b). Jiang et al. (2018a)
developed a smart web-based data discovery engine that mines and utilizes data
relevancy from metadata and user behavior data. The engine enables machine-learned
ranking based on several features that can reﬂect users’ search preferences.
9.4.3
Data Processing Layer
Data processing layer is a core component of the data analytics architecture. To ana-
lyze terabyte and petabyte datasets with low time latency, even in a real-time manner,
sophisticated parallel computing algorithms and scalable computing resources are
required in the big data processing framework (Yang et al. 2015a). Advanced open-
source parallel computing solutions, e.g., Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and their vari-
ants in the Earth data domain have been leveraged to support data analysis and mining
tasks with better performance.
Hadoop MapReduce is a high-performance batch processing parallel framework
that solves large computational problems on distributed storage systems (White
2012). It transfers the algorithm code to data nodes rather than moving data blocks to
a compute node to avoid I/O bottlenecks. Spark enables high-performance data anal-
ysis with in-memory computing. An in-memory data structure called the Resilient
Distributed Dataset (RDD) manages datasets distributed in a Spark cluster (Zaharia
et al. 2012). However, the original distributed frameworks have limitations on big
spatiotemporal data processing. Yu et al. (2015) noted that the system scalability
338
Y. Li et al.
for spatiotemporal data and interactive performance are the two main challenges for
big Earth data processing. To solve these problems, scientists and engineers have
customized open-source solutions for spatiotemporal data analysis.
SpatialHadoop is a MapReduce-based framework with native support for spatial
data including a simple spatial high-level language, a two-level spatial index struc-
ture, a fundamental spatial component built on the MapReduce layer and three basic
spatial operations (range query, k-NN query, and spatial link) (Eldawy and Mokbel
2015). GeoSpark provides operational tools for spatial big data processing based on
Spark (Yu et al. 2015). The Spatial Resilient Distributed Datasets (SRDDs) structure
represents spatial data blocks in memory and index objects using quad-tree and r-tree
in each RDD partition (Lenka et al. 2016). ClimateSpark integrates Spark SQL and
Apache Zeppelin to develop a web portal that facilitates interaction among climatol-
ogists, climate data, analytical operations and computing resources (Hu et al. 2018b).
As an extension of Scala, GeoTrellis supports high-performance raster data analysis.
GeoMesa provides spatiotemporal data persistence on Hadoop and column-family
databases (e.g., Accumulo, HBase), as well as a suite of geospatial analytical tools
for massive vector and raster data (Hughes et al. 2015).
As described in this section, a service-oriented, scalable architecture usually con-
tains three major layers to provide desirable functionalities and capabilities: (1) the
bottom data storage layer provides physical data storage, (2) the data query layer
enables data discovery capabilities with proper functionality and interoperability,
and (3) the data processing layer supports extensible, interoperable and scalable
analytical functionalities based on open source solutions and their variants from the
geoscience communities. With the architecture, big Earth data could be accessed and
analyzed with low time latency or even in real time. However, it is challenging to
set up such architecture and share data stored inside them due to the requirements
of storage resources, computing resources, complicated conﬁgurations, and domain
knowledge. Fortunately, the paradigm of cloud computing, discussed in the next
section, brings potential solutions to ease the process of analytical framework setup
and data sharing.
9.5
Cloud Computing for Big Data
9.5.1
Cloud Computing and Other Related Computing
Paradigms
Grid computing and High Performance Computing (HPC) have been utilized for big
data analytics. Grid computing, a distributed system of computer resources, performs
large tasks using loosely coupled computers in a distributed system (Hamscher et al.
2000). The European Data Grid project utilizes grid computing to support exploration
of multi-petabyte datasets (Segal et al. 2000) and the TeraGrid GIScience gateway
utilized grid computing to perform computationally intensive geographical analytics
9
Big Data and Cloud Computing
339
(Wang and Liu 2009). HPC uses supercomputers to run applications in parallel,
efﬁciently and quickly, and is used in the PRACE project to serve European scientists
with high-performance computing capabilities to conduct research (Hacker et al.
2010).
Cloud computing virtualizes computer resources as a resource pool to provide
computing resources over the network by optimizing resource usage in terms of the
CPU, RAM, network, and storage. Cloud computing has intrinsic connection to the
Grid Computing paradigm (Foster et al. 2008) in that both are distributed computing
systems. Cloud computing relies on remote servers whereas grid computing connects
servers or personal computers over a common network using a Wide Area Network
(WAN) to perform parallel tasks (Foster et al. 2008). Compared with HPC, cloud
computing is cost effective and easy to use. Although cloud computing can provide
high performance computing capability, HPC is irreplaceable for some applications
since supercomputers are required to process very complicated processes such as
climate simulations. In addition, resources in cloud computing are controlled by the
service providers and users have limited controls.
In addition to cloud computing, other new computing paradigms have emerged
to build a comprehensive and economic computing framework. For example, edge
computingcanprocessdataattheedgeofnetworkduetotheadvancementoftheIoTs.
IoT applications usually produce a massive amount of streaming data and require
near-real time response; thus, cloud computing alone is not an optimal solution for
data collection and analysis for such real-time applications. In edge computing, edge
nodes serve as data providers and consumers to protect data privacy and make full
use of the computing capacity of edge nodes. Less data is transferred to the cloud
computing platform after data preprocessing in edge nodes, reducing the response
time and bandwidth cost (Shi et al. 2016).
Mobile computing with portable computing nodes has become an important com-
puting paradigm with the improvements in the computing and storage capacity of
smart devices such as smartphones and tablets (Qi and Gani 2012). Although ser-
vices provided by mobile computing are not as reliable as edge computing and cloud
computing due to the restrictions in battery volume and network connection, mobile
computing can collect data and reach end users where cloud computing and edge
computing are inaccessible.
These computing paradigms have advantages and disadvantages, and can be inte-
grated to complement each other and provide reliable and effective data storage and
processing frameworks according to the data characteristics and computing require-
ments. Cloud computing and big data are the two most important technologies in
Digital Earth. The following section discusses the utilization of cloud computing to
support big data management in Digital Earth.
340
Y. Li et al.
9.5.2
Introduction to Cloud Computing
As a new computing paradigm, cloud computing delivers scalable, on-demand, pay-
as-you-go access to a pool of computing resources (Mell and Grance 2011; Yang
et al. 2011a). Practically, cloud computing aims to maximize the utilization rate of
physical resources and provide virtual resources to aid applications and services.
Cloud computing relies on several technologies including virtualization, network
security, and high availability to provide services over the network. These technolo-
gies make it easier, more efﬁcient, and more economical to set up architecture for
big data analysis.
Virtualization is the fundamental technology for cloud computing, which abstracts
an application, operating system, or data store from the underlying hardware or
software. Virtualization creates a “layer of abstraction” between the physical systems
and a virtual environment in the virtualization process (Big Data Virtualization).
Server virtualization optimizes the use of redundant computing and storage resources
by virtualizing distributed computer resources (e.g., CPU, RAM, Network, and Disk)
and managing them in the same resource pool. With virtualization, cloud computing
can provide on-demand big data services and support big data technologies including
big data storage, process, analysis, visualization, and remote collaboration (Fig. 9.3).
Virtualizing big data resources as a pool serves as a user-friendly interface and makes
big data analytics accessible to end users.
As one of the cloud solutions, public clouds are the most accessible cloud com-
puting services offered by third-party providers (e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud) over the Internet. Public clouds are available to
the public and may be offered on a pay-per-usage model (Li et al. 2010). In contrast
to public clouds, private clouds are dedicated for use inside an organization. Pri-
vate cloud resources can be managed by an organization or by a third-party vendor,
Fig. 9.3 Cloud computing for big data analysis
9
Big Data and Cloud Computing
341
regardless of the physical location of the resources (Dillon et al. 2010). The com-
puting resources in a private cloud are isolated and delivered via a secure private
network.
The advanced features of auto scaling and load balancing through resource mon-
itoring further maximize the capability of cloud computing resources. Based on the
individual performance of a machine, autoscaling can be applied to allow for some
servers to rest during times of low load to save electricity costs and automatically add
more instances during times of high demand. In addition, load balancing improves
the distribution of workloads across multiple instances to optimize resource use,
minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single instance.
9.5.3
Cloud Computing to Support Big Data
Cloud computing combines distributed computing resources into one virtual envi-
ronment, providing big data analytics and solutions during the life cycles of
big data. Three main categories of cloud computing services are (1) Infrastruc-
ture as a Service (IaaS), (2) Software as a Service (SaaS), and (3) Platform
as a Service (PaaS). Together with Data as a Service (DaaS), Model as a Ser-
vice (MaaS; Li et al. 2014a, b) and workﬂow as a service (WaaS; Krämer and
Senner 2015), cloud computing offers big data researchers the opportunity of
anything as a service (XaaS; Yang et al. 2017b).
Cloud Storage for Big Data Storage
The characteristics of big data in high volume lead to challenges for data storage.
Cloud computing’s potential for unlimited storage support helps solve the volume
challenge of big data, as the cloud provides virtually customizable storage with
elastically expandable and reducible size. An alternative solution is Data Storage as
aService(DSaaS) enabledbyblockstorage, whichis thecapabilityof addingexternal
storages as “blocks”. With block storage, it is possible to enlarge the storage size
without physically loading hard drives. Virtually unlimited scalable storage offered
by cloud computing grants users the capability of dynamic adjustment to satisfy
the storage requirements of data with high volume and velocity. The modularized
virtual resource offers effortless data sharing within production environments by
allowingforanexternaldatablocktobedetachedandremountedfromonemachineto
another. External data storage can be automatically backed up to prevent users from
losing data, and backups that are securely saved at the back-end server can be easily
transferred and restored. In addition, information security is guaranteed because the
physical location cannot be obtained from the disk drive (Mayama et al. 2011).
Cloud Computing for Big Data Processing
Processing large volumes of data requires dedicated computing resources, e.g., faster
CPUs and networks and larger disks and RAMs (Yang et al. 2017b). Cloud computing
342
Y. Li et al.
provides on-demand resources and delivers conﬁgurable resources including mount-
able external storage spaces, computing resources (CPU, RAM), and network ser-
vices. Traditionally, a computer uses approximately two-thirds of the power of a
busy computer (JoSEP et al. 2010), and cloud computing has the potential to provide
on-demand computing resources. Isolated virtual structures have been created for big
data systems to enhance system stabilities, which can be easily managed in differ-
ent ﬁle systems and replicated through backup images to provide fast conﬁguration
recovery. The ability to replicate environments automates the expansion of compute
nodes in virtual machine clusters, thereby efﬁciently utilizing resource pools to sup-
port big data analytics. With the foundational support of storage for big data, data
processing inherits the advantages of fast data acquisition and relocation.
Although cloud computing could serve as an excellent infrastructure option for
big data processing, several aspects should be considered to minimize the bottleneck
effect for the general processing speed, such as the choice of cloud volume type
according to I/O demand and cloud bandwidth selection according to application
requirements.
Cloud Computing for Big Data Analytics
Popular big data analytical platforms such as Apache Hadoop are tradition-
ally installed on physical machine clusters, resulting in a waste of computing
resources due to hardware redundancy (CPU and RAM). With the virtual clusters
provided by cloud computing through virtualization technology, distributed analyti-
cal platforms can be migrated to the virtual clusters from physical machine clusters,
optimizing the usage of computing resources in an efﬁcient manner.
With the aid of autoscaling and load balancing, deploying on-demand and scal-
able big data analytical platforms could easily provide resilient analytical frame-
works and minimize waste of computing resources. Autoscaling supports parallel
algorithms on distributed systems and architectures for scalability. It allows for
the expanded resources to function when the algorithms or programs are enabled
with parallel computing capability. Without it, public cloud providers such as AWS
could not offer automatic scalability (JoSEP et al. 2010). The load balancer dis-
tributes workloads among virtual clusters and triggers autoscaling functions when
analytics require higher computing conﬁgurations. The virtual system as a whole
could dynamically ﬁt higher computing requirements by launching more virtual
duplications as needed. The load balancer acts as a virtual network trafﬁc distributor
and can be optimized to better allocate overall resources.
Cloud Computing for Big Data Sharing and Remote Collaboration
Traditional deployment of big data systems requires complicated settings and efforts
to share data assets. It lacks access control and often leads to data security and data
privacy issues. Cloud computing enhances the sharing of information by applying
modern analytical tools and managing controlled access and security (Radke and
Tseng 2015). Virtualization enables different parties to share data assets to achieve
various goals and objectives under a centralized management system. With the sup-
port of cloud computing, it is possible to ﬂexibly share data and remotely collaborate,
which involve interdisciplinary collaborations and advanced workﬂows. Though data
9

sharing, computational resource sharing, and production environment sharing, cloud
computing can potentially be used to build a perceptual environment to support var-
ious businesses and applications (Li et al. 2015). Unfortunately, workﬂow sharing
remains challenging due to domain boundaries (Yang et al. 2017b).
9.6
Case Study: EarthCube/DataCube
Big data and cloud computing enable Earth scientists and application developers
to create web-accessible frameworks and platforms to efﬁciently store, retrieve and
analyze big Earth data. In the Earth science domain, scientists have proposed a series
of data models, frameworks, and initiatives to ensure the success of heterogeneous
data sharing and analysis. For example, a 10-year framework initiative on sustain-
able consumption and production from 2013 to 2023 was launched by the United
Nations Environmental Program (UNEP). The Future Earth framework, an interna-
tional research program in the environmental science community, serves as an evolv-
ing platform to support transitions toward sustainability (Lahsen 2016). Microsoft’s
Eye-On-Earth platform aids climate change research in several European countries
by collecting and sharing water and air quality data (Microsoft 2011). As part of
the European program to monitor the Earth, the Copernicus Data and Information
Access Service (DIAS) platform collects and processes data from remote and in situ
sensors and provides reliable information covering six thematic areas including land,
ocean, atmosphere, climate, emergency, and security (Bereta et al. 2019). Through
its Exploitation Platforms (EP) initiative, the European Space Agency (ESA) built
several cloud-based Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEPs) in a preoperational
phase for geo-hazard monitoring and prevention (Esch et al. 2017). The CASEarth
Poles comprise a comprehensive big data platform of the three poles including the
Arctic, Antarctic and the Tibetan plateau within the framework of the “Big Earth
Data Science and Engineering” program of the Chinese Academy of Science (Guo
et al. 2017). One of the current initiatives is the NSF EarthCube originated from the
NSF GEO Vision report (NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences 2009). In this
section, we introduce the EarthCube project and a big data infrastructure, Data Cube,
as two cases of big data and cloud computing in the context of Digital Earth.
9.6.1
EarthCube
NSF EarthCube involves (1) Building Blocks (BBs), to develop novel infrastructure
capabilities and demonstrate their value in a science context; (2) Research Coordi-
nation Networks (RCNs), to engage the science community around joint goals; (3)
Conceptual Designs (CDs), to develop broad architecture design and explore inte-
grative systems; (4) Integrative Activities (IAs), to explore concepts for the design of
an enterprise architecture, and (5) Data Infrastructures (DIs) to lay the groundwork
344
Y. Li et al.
for shared data. The EarthCube concept originated from the NSF GEO Vision report
(NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences 2009), which was issued by the Advisory
Committee for NSF’s Geosciences Directorate (GEO) and identiﬁed the future focus
of the Earth science community as ‘fostering a sustainable future through a better
understanding of our complex and changing planet.’ To achieve the GEO vision, the
GEO and Ofﬁce of Cyberinfrastructure (OCI) jointly launched the EarthCube (NSF
2011) initiative as a driving engine to build a geospatial cyberinfrastructure (similar
to a Digital Earth infrastructure, Yang et al. 2010) to (1) understand and forecast
the behavior of a complex and evolving Earth system; (2) reduce vulnerability and
sustain life; and (3) train the workforce of the future.
EarthCube (2012) is targeted at (1) transforming the conduct of data-enabled
geoscience-related research, (2) creating effective community-driven cyberinfras-
tructure, (3) allowing for interoperable resource discovery and knowledge man-
agement, and (4) achieving interoperability and data integration across disciplines
(Fig. 9.4).
In addition, EarthCube is evolving within a rapidly growing, diverse, and wide-
ranging global environment. In addition to the collaboration within EarthCube, there
are other contributing entities ranging from individual data sets and software applica-
tions to national and international cyberinfrastructure systems. The NSF has funded
the development of EarthCube through individual EarthCube awards since 2013. In
2016, the NSF awarded 11 new EarthCube activities, for a total of 51 awards. A
sampling of efforts in EarthCube that beneﬁt from big data and cloud computing are
introduced below.

Conceptual design DASHER
Yangetal.(2015b)proposedaconceptualEarthCubeArchitecture,DASHER(Devel-
oping a Data-Oriented Human-Centric Enterprise Architecture for EarthCube), to
support EarthCube and facilitate data communication and social collaboration in
pursuit of collaborative Earth sciences research. The ﬁnal product is a four-volume
report containing different viewpoints that describe EarthCube architecture from dif-
ferent conceptual perspectives such as capabilities, operations, services, and projects.
It provides a comprehensive conceptual reference for developing a detailed and prac-
tical architecture to address the requirements of the EarthCube community. DASHER
was one of the ﬁrst projects funded by EarthCube to design the conceptual framework
integrating computational resources and big data sources.
Building Block GeoSciCloud
GeoSciCloud (Deploying Multi-Facility Cyberinfrastructure in Commercial and Pri-
vate Cloud-based Systems) investigated two medium-size NSF funded data centers
to deploy data collections with cloud-based services in different environments to
assess feasibility and impact (EarthCube 2019). These environments include (1)
commercial cloud environments offered by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and (2)
NSF-supported extensive computing facilities that are just beginning to offer services
with characteristics of cloud computing.
GeoSciCloud helps EarthCube compare and contrast these three environments
(the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), commer-
cial cloud, and current infrastructure) in the massive data ingestion to the cloud, data
processing time, elasticity, the speed of data egress from multiple environments,
overall costs of operation, interoperability, and reliability of real-time data stream-
ing.
Integrated Activity ECITE
The EarthCube Integration and Test Environment (ECITE) is an outgrowth of activ-
ities of the EarthCube Testbed Working Group. The ECITE approach focuses on
integrating existing effective technologies and resources as well as capabilities built
by the EarthCube community using a cloud platform to provide a federated and inter-
operable test environment (EarthCube 2016). ECITE engages scientists and technol-
ogists from multiple disciplines and geographic regions across the Earth science
community to develop requirements, prototype, design, build, and test an integration
test-bed that will support cross-disciplinary research. The hybrid federated system
will provide a robust set of distributed resources including both public and private
cloud capabilities. This research addresses timely issues of integration, testing and
evaluation methodologies and best practices with a strong interoperability theme to
advance disciplinary research through the integration of diverse and heterogeneous
data, algorithms, systems, and sciences.

Y. Li et al.
Integrated Activity Pangeo
Pangeo3
(an open-source big data climate science platform) integrates a
suite of open-source software tools that can tackle petabyte-scale Atmo-
sphere/Ocean/Land/Climate (AOC) datasets. Pangeo aims to cultivate an ecosystem
in which the next generation of open-source analysis tools for ocean, atmosphere
and climate science can be developed, distributed, and sustained. These tools must
be scalable to meet the current and future challenges of big data, and the solutions
should leverage the existing expertise outside of the AOC community. The resulting
software improvements contribute to upstream open source projects, ensuring the
long-term sustainability of the platform. The result is a robust new software toolkit
for climate science and beyond. This toolkit will enhance the Data Science aspect of
EarthCube. Implementation of these tools on the cloud was tested, taking advantage
of an agreement between commercial cloud service providers and the NSF for big
data solicitation.
9.6.2
Data Cube
The term ‘data cube’ was originally used in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)
of business and statistical data but has more recently been used in Earth domains as
an approach to manage and analyze large and rapidly growing datasets. In Digital
Earth, a data cube represents a multidimensional (n-D) array that stores gridded data
or array-based data produced by remote sensing and simulation (Zhang et al. 2005).
A data cube can be based on regular or irregular gridded, spatial and/or temporal data
with multiple parameters. To support the management, sharing, and serving of Digital
Earth data, tools and models, different cyberinfrastructures have been developed
based on data cubes. Examples include the EarthServer that provides data cube
services for Earth observations based on the RASDAMAN array database (Baumann
et al. 2016). Another example is the Earth Observation Data and Processing Platform
developed by the European Commission to integrate and analyze the combination
of satellite and in situ Earth observations for sustainable development goals (Soille
et al. 2016). The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) provides a data
processing infrastructure based on data cubes to support Earth science objectives in
developing countries, with a focus on remote sensing data (Nativi et al. 2017). The
platform automatically ingests different remote sensing data into an N-dimensional
data array.
Challenging issues in providing data services in data cube infrastructure include
interoperability, rapid data access and transfer, and real-time processing and analysis
(Strobl et al. 2017). Interoperability issues occur because datasets from various
sources can have distinct parameterizations, spectral band deﬁnitions, projections,
ﬁle formats, and database structures. One solution is to standardize the preprocess-
ing procedure before storage and sharing with the community. The Open Geospatial
3http://pangeo.io/.

Big Data and Cloud Computing
347
Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) Common Data Model (CDM)
deﬁnes important element parameterization (Robin 2011). Datasets must be rep-
resented along different predeﬁned dimensions of the data cube, including space,
time, and parameter properties. For projection difference issues, OGC recently devel-
oped the Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) to optimize the loss of geospatial
data during the reprojection process and seamlessly integrate GIS data from various
sources (Stefanakis 2016). Data cube infrastructures also require rapid data access
and transfer and real-time processing and analysis. Functionalities for user inter-
actions must be built for various user demands, including ﬁle manipulation, data
preprocessing, and analysis. These functionalities should also meet the standards of
geographical information processing in OGC Web Coverage Services (WCS), geo-
graphic information analysis in the OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS),
and format-independent data cube exchange in the OGC Coverage Implementation
Schema (CIS).
Cloud computing and big data frameworks could enhance the data cube archive,
visualization, and analysis in many ways to meet the needs of big Earth data knowl-
edge mining. In cloud computing, storage is a virtual resource that can be attached
and scaled on demand. By leveraging cloud computing and big data frameworks,
visualizing data cubes and performing complicated spatiotemporal queries are more
effortless than ever before (Zhizhin et al. 2011). One example of data cube visu-
alization in the Earth science domain is the EOD4 (Earth Observation Data Cube),
which enables advanced data access and retrieval capabilities for the European cov-
erage of Landsat-8 and the global coverage of Sentinel2 data. It aims to improve the
accessibility of Big Earth data and offers more than 100 TB of Atmosphere, Land and
Ocean EO products, demonstrating satellite data in the context of a virtual globe. The
ESDC5 (Earth System Data Cube) is another example of climate data cube visualiza-
tion and analysis that aims to develop an environment to tap into the full potential of
the ESA’s Earth observations and integrate with the Biosphere-Atmosphere Virtual
Laboratory (BAVL) analysis environment. The use of cloud computing technologies
in big data visualization enables a massive amount of end users to explore data online
at the same time with very low latency.
Data cube partition and parallel query could be achieved by utilizing distributed
big data frameworks, which are faster and easier than traditional noncluster methods.
Pagani et al. combined the data cube concept with cloud computing to manage and
analyze large Earth datasets and observed better outcomes than traditional ﬁle-based
approach (2018). Open Data Cube6 is another example of the utilization of advances
in cloud computing, providing free and open technologies to end users without local
infrastructure. Thus, developing countries can access data and computing resources
to build applications that aid decision making. The Australian Geoscience Data Cube
(AGDA) solves similar problems of data sharing. It makes more than three decades
of satellite imagery available for the ﬁrst time, spanning Australia’s total land area at

Conclusion
The advancement of Digital Earth drives collection of massive data such as trans-
portation data, utility data, hazard data and forest data to monitor the Earth and
support decision making. Valuable information extracted from the collected big data
can further speed the development of Digital Earth. Digital Earth data continue to
grow at a faster speed and with more heterogeneous types, leading to challenges to the
lifecycle of data management including storage, processing, analytics, visualization,
sharing, and integration. Fortunately, the emerging paradigm of cloud computing
brings potential solutions to address these challenges. Compared with traditional
computing mechanisms, cloud computing has the advantages of better data process-
ing computing supports. The customizable conﬁguration saves computing resources
elastically, and data manipulation with higher security and ﬂexibility offers secure
data storage, transfer and sharing. Analytics enabled by cloud computing advance the
process by allowing for automatic resource expansion when there are higher require-
ments.
To manage and analyze big Earth data, a service-oriented, scalable architecture
based on cloud computing was introduced in a three-layer architecture: (1) the bot-
tom data storage layer provides physical infrastructure, storage, and ﬁle systems; (2)
the data query layer supplies data discovery capabilities with proper functionality
and interoperability; and (3) the data processing layer supports extensibility, inter-
operability and scalability based on open source solutions and their variants from
Earth science communities. With this architecture, big Earth data can be accessed
and analyzed with low time latency or even in real time. The analysis results could
be published by a web-based map server (e.g., GeoServer) or web-based notebook
(e.g., Zeppelin) for visualization, public access, and collaboration, contributing to
advancements in handling big data in Digital Earth to fulﬁll the requirements of
scalability, extensibility and ﬂexibility.

Abstract In this chapter, we provide an overview of different artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques and discuss how these techniques have
been employed in managing geospatial data sets as they pertain to Digital Earth.
We introduce statistical ML methods that are frequently used in spatial problems
and their applications. We discuss generative models, one of the hottest topics in
ML, to illustrate the possibility of generating new data sets that can be used to
train data analysis methods or to create new possibilities for Digital Earth such as
virtual reality or augmented reality. We ﬁnish the chapter with a discussion of deep
learning methods that have high predictive power and have shown great promise in
data analysis of geospatial data sets provided by Digital Earth.

Introduction
Earth and its associated data sets are massive. Various forms of geospatial data sets
are constantly accumulated and captured by different forms of sensors and devices
(Mahdavi-Amiri et al. 2015). Managing such an immense data set is a challenge.
As a result, many automated techniques have been designed to process geospatial
data sets with minimal human interference. Since manual involvement should be
minimal, the machines should be capable of processing data and delivering mean-
ingful information to the users. With advancements in machine learning, processing

geospatial data sets has signiﬁcantly improved. In this chapter, we discuss artiﬁcial
intelligence and machine learning techniques that have been useful to manage and
process geospatial data sets. Because the processing of geospatial data can also be
a source of knowledge, some methods use existing data to generate and synthesize
new data.
We start by discussing some traditional and statistical approaches in machine
learning and then present more recent learning techniques employed for geospatial
data sets. Traditional methods include predeﬁned models such as linear regression,
PCA, SVD, active contour, and SVM, in which the model is ﬁxed and the learning
is based on an optimization. We also brieﬂy discuss evolutionary and agent-based
methods and autoencoders as traditional methods that can be deep or shallow. We
then discuss more recent deep learning techniques, including reinforcement learning,
deep convolutional networks and generative models such as variational autoencoders
and generative adversarial networks. In this chapter, we describe some applications
of these machine learning techniques to handle geospatial data sets that are the main
content of Digital Earth. In the future, a dynamic Digital Earth that can use such
techniques to work with geospatial datasets is extremely practical. Currently, such
methods are sparsely used on very speciﬁc Digital Earth data sets. We imagine that
a more advanced Digital Earth will use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques
much more than they are currently used.
10.2
Traditional and Statistical Machine Learning
Inferring patterns and forming relationships using artiﬁcial intelligence require
knowledge of some characteristics of the phenomena/system of interest. One of the
early approaches to enabling artiﬁcial intelligence for complex problems was to cre-
ate knowledge bases that contain explicit sets of rules and associations, also known
as ontology (Gruber 1993). For data pertaining to Earth system modeling, different
niche knowledge bases were designed by various authors (McCarthy 1988; Rizzoli
and Young 1997). The knowledge base approach to artiﬁcial intelligence required
expert input to deﬁne the rules and associations. In addition, the expert knowledge
had to be represented in a “computable form” (Sowa 2000), posing a bottleneck
for these approaches. For spatially varying, complex phenomena, ontology repre-
sentations were deﬁned for Earth’s subsystems such as in environmental modeling
and planning (Cortés et al. 2001), and ecological reasoning (Rykiel 1989). General
spatial and GIS knowledge bases were proposed by various authors (Kuipers 1996;
Egenhofer and Mark 1995; Fonseca et al. 2002).
Despite the plethora of niche knowledge bases, knowledge base artiﬁcial intelli-
gence requires assertions and ground truths (Lenat 1995), which can conﬂict with
observations (Goodfellow et al. 2016). Numerous attempts to address this limitation
have been presented by various authors, such as deﬁning hierarchical (Kuipers 1996),
or location/problem-tailored knowledge bases (Rizzoli and Young 1997).

Artiﬁcial Intelligence

Statistical machine learning alleviates the limitations of the knowledge-based
approach to artiﬁcial intelligence and discovers rules and patterns from the data
directly without explicit supervision (Goodfellow et al. 2016). In the case of statistical
learning, patterns and rules from an unknown underlying process are deﬁned for
descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics.
Applications of statistical learning to understand and forecast natural and human
phenomena are evaluated with respect to the components of the general deﬁnition of
machine learning (Mitchell 1997). Mitchell’s (1997) deﬁnition is as follows:
A computer program is said to learn from experience [D] with respect to some class of
tasks T and performance measure [Q], if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by [Q],
improves with experience [D].
Machine learning methods are broadly grouped into supervised and unsupervised
methods. Supervised machine learning methods experience modeled phenomena
through so-called labeled training data. Labels in the training data correspond to the
target variable to be predicted, either quantitative (regression) or qualitative (clas-
siﬁcation). Training data consists of predictors and their corresponding predictand.
Thus, supervised machine learning methods learn relationships in the data through
experiencing input/output pairs.
Unsupervised machine learning methods discover patterns in the data without
supervision or explicit rules. Clustering is one of the most common unsupervised
machine learning methods for geospatial datasets.
10.2.1
Supervised Learning
Supervised learning aims to deﬁne a relationship between r predictor variables,
denoted by X = (X1, X2, . . . , Xr), and e predictands, Y = (Y1, Y2, . . . , Ye). Super-
vised learning can be posed as a density estimation problem (Hastie et al. 2001):
P(Y|X) = P(Y, X)/P(X)
(10.1)
where P(Y|X) is the conditional probability density of observing the predictand
given the predictors, P(Y, X) is the joint probability distribution of the predictand
and predictors, and P(X) is the marginal probability distribution of the predictors.
Using Mitchell’s (1997) description, the performance Q can be quantiﬁed using a loss
function L where, for a given method and set of parameters , a location function,
μ(x), is minimized (Hastie et al. 2001) in Eq. 10.2.
μ(x) = argminEY|XL(Y, )
(10.2)
For a given , a supervised machine learning method predicts the values at X
as ˆy. The loss function, L, quantiﬁes the error between ˆy and the training data y.

E. Guérin et al.
Some examples of supervised machine learning methods as they pertain to geospatial
analysis are given in the following subsection.
10.2.1.1
Random Forest
Random forest is a framework for nonparametric estimation in which both classiﬁ-
cation and regression can be performed (Breiman 2001). It has gained popularity in
numerous geospatial applications due to its ﬂexibility in accommodating different
types of inputs (categorical or continuous) and its ability to model complex relation-
ships in the data.
Random forest addresses the overﬁtting limitation of classiﬁcation and regression
trees (CART). Random forest uses bootstrap aggregating, also known as bagging, to
create subsets of the training data by sampling with replacement to build different
CARTs (Breiman 1996). Each of the CARTs that make up the forest predict, or vote,
for a given data point of x and the forest returns the majority vote in a classiﬁcation
or the average forest prediction for a regression. The voting scheme of random
forest allows for complex relationships to be captured in the data that might not be
possible otherwise. A pictorial summary of a random forest classiﬁer for classifying a
successful retail store (one) or an unsuccessful one (zero) with respect to its distance
to the nearest highway exit and the number of brands it carries is given in Fig. 10.1.

Note that every tree experiences different subsets of training data and their struc-
tures are different from one another. The voting scheme allows for capturing underly-
ingpatternsinthedatabydeﬁningcomplexrelationshipscapturedinalargeensemble
of trees rather than a single tree.
In geospatial problems, various random forest classiﬁers are used in a wide range
of problems, including land cover classiﬁcation (Gislason et al. 2006) and ecological
modeling (Cutler et al. 2007). In land cover classiﬁcation, random forest speeds up
classiﬁcation of land use by forming a relationship between the satellite image RGB
value and the type of land it corresponds to. In this case, the training data consists of
tagged locations at which the land cover and RGB values are known. An example of
the random forest classiﬁer output for land use classiﬁcation is given in Fig. 10.2.
In Fig. 10.2, a small number of farms and areas around them were used as training
data (marked with black polygons). The training set that consists of 300 farms was
used within the random forest classiﬁer to deﬁne land use in southern California.
10.2.1.2
Geographically Weighted Regression
Geographically weighted regression (GWR) provides a statistical framework for
incorporating spatial dependency within a linear regression system (Fotheringham
362
E. Guérin et al.
Fig. 10.3 Conceptual
depiction of GWR.
Regression is performed for
the orange point with a red
circle deﬁning the
neighborhood
et al. 2003). GWR provides spatial extensions to ordinary least squares and general-
ized linear models (Nelder and Wedderburn 1972) such as geographically weighted
logistic regression. GWR is depicted conceptually in Fig. 10.3.
Figure 10.3 illustrates a regression system solved within the neighborhood (red
circle) for the location indicated in orange. First, GWR deﬁnes a weighting scheme
to determine spatial weights for the neighbors, and the predictors X at every location
(blue) are weighted with respect to their distance to the location for which the regres-
sion is performed (orange). The geographically weighted linear system of equations
solved at a point i can be expressed as follows:
ˆβ(ui, vi) =

XTW(ui, vi)X
−1XTW(ui, vi)Y
(10.3)
where ˆβ(ui, vi) is the coefﬁcient matrix for the predictors X at location i. W(ui, vi)
is a diagonal weighting matrix that contains geographic weights on its diagonal
elements for neighbors inside the neighborhood window (red circle in Fig. 10.3),
and Y contains the variable being predicted. Note that the linear system above is
similar to the general linear regression system given in Eq. 10.4.
ˆβ =

XTX
−1XTY
(10.4)
where ˆβ is deﬁned globally for the entire dataset. The geographic weights are
inversely weighted with respect to the distance. Thus, the weights have large values
for neighbors close to the regression location i. Different weighting schemes and
neighborhood deﬁnitions are possible; the reader is encouraged to explore seminal
work on this topic (Fotheringham et al. 2003).
10
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
363
Spatial representation via a weighting scheme can give GWR high predictive
power for geospatial datasets in which a strong spatial autocorrelation is observed.
The impact of incorporating spatial relationships in the regression model is demon-
strated by comparing GWR with a nonspatial supervised machine learning method.
In this example, GWR is juxtaposed against a random forest predictor for a prob-
lem with strong spatial autocorrelation in the data. Statistical climate downscaling
(Wilby and Wigley 1997) was performed with GWR and a random forest regressor.
Statistical downscaling calibrates the output of a global circulation model (GCM) to
observed climate data such as temperature or precipitation. In this example, climate
downscaling for the lower 48 US states; a regression model can be deﬁned between
19 predictors (from GCM) and the observed average temperature. The regression
model can be used to predict the average temperature for the entire lower 48 states.
A random forest predictor can be trained using the observed average temperature and
simulated GCM variables. The GWR model is formed using only 3 of the indepen-
dent predictors due to the collinearity restriction of GWR. Below are the predicted
average temperature proﬁles.
Note that the average temperature proﬁle estimated in Fig. 10.4a depicts the pat-
terns of temperature change captured in Fig. 10.4b. Even though fewer predictors
are used in the GWR than in the random forest regressor, large-scale patterns in the
temperature proﬁle changes are captured. The GWR model in Fig. 10.4a was also
compared to a random forest regressor model trained using the same three predictors.
In that case, the GWR returned a mean-squared error that was 60% of that of the
random forest regressor.
10.2.1.3
SVM
Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised nonparametric statistical learning
method (Corinna and Vapnik 1995). In its original form, the method comprises a set
of labeled data instances and the SVM attempts to ﬁnd a hyperplane that separates
the dataset into a discrete predeﬁned number of classes as consistently as possible
for the training data (see Fig. 10.5) (Vapnik 1979). It is possible to generalize SVM
to nonlinear kernels such as radial basis functions to learn and classify data sets with
higher complexity (Schölkopf and Smola 2002).
As studiedanddiscussedbyMountrakis et al. (2011), SVMs havebeenextensively
employed in remote sensing and geospatial data analysis due to their ability to use
small training data sets, often resulting a higher classiﬁcation accuracy than the
traditional methods (Mantero et al. 2005). For instance, SVM has been used in
road extraction from IKONOS imagery by (Huang and Zhang 2009) assessing the
inﬂuenceoftheslope/aspectoftheterrainontheforestclassiﬁcationaccuracy(Huang
et al. 2008), a crop classiﬁcation task (Wilson et al. 2004), and many more factors.

trakis et al. (2011)
10.2.1.4
Active Contours and Active Shapes
Active contours or snakes have been developed with the aim of ﬁnding important
features in an image by ﬁtting a curve to the edges and lines of an image (Kass
et al. 1988). Active contours are a set of energy-minimizing splines that are guided
by external forces from the image. Snakes have been used extensively in geospatial
image processing to detect features such as roads and buildings.
Active contours were later extended to active shapes to accommodate speciﬁc
patterns in a set of objects and identify only those that are present in the training
data (Cootes et al. 1995). In essence, they are very similar to active contours, but
active shapes can only deform and ﬁt the data that is consistent with the training
set. Both active shapes and active contours have been extensively used in different
applications of remote sensing and geoscience, such as object extraction (Liu et al.
2013), lane detection (Heij et al. 2004), and road extraction (see Fig. 10.6) (Kumar
et al. 2017; Laptev 1997).
10.2.2
Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning aims to infer the distribution of P(X) in Eq. 10.1. Unlike
supervised learning, P(Y|X) or P(X, Y) is not employed (Hastie et al. 2001). Thus,
366
E. Guérin et al.
Fig. 10.6 Active contours used to extract roads. Image taken form Laptev (1997)
unsupervised learning does not utilize any training dataset that contains information
on P(X, Y). One of the most common uses of unsupervised learning in geospatial
analysis is in deﬁning clusters and regions. These two terms differ, as clustering refers
to deﬁning groups based on value similarity in the data whereas regionalization
performs clustering under spatial constraints (Duque et al. 2007). Both of these
unsupervised learning approaches have wide applications (Duque et al. 2007; Hastie
et al. 2001; Mitchell 1997; von Luxburg 2010). Most clustering and regionalization
methods require deﬁnition of k, the number of clusters to divide X into. There are
extensive surveys of clustering and regionalization in the literature for readers to
refer to (Duque et al. 2007; Jain et al. 1999).
10.2.2.1
SKATER Algorithm
As discussed in Chap. 8, the K-means algorithm (Macqueen 1967) aims to partition
X into k groups and minimize the intergroup dissimilarity with the assumption that
minimal intergroup dissimilarity corresponds to distinct groups. K-means seeks to
create groups that consist of similar elements, ensuring that dissimilar elements are
assigned to different groups. Mathematically:
μ(x) = argminC
k

i=1

x∈ci
x −¯Cι
2
(10.4)
where C = {C1, C2, . . . , Ck} is the group of clusters, with a cluster cm consisting
of a subset of X and c1 ∪c2 ∪· · · ∪ck = X. K-means has various uses in geospatial
analysis, including detecting patterns in trafﬁc accidents (Anderson 2009), analyz-
ing landslides (Keefer 2000) and creating labels by clustering topo-climatic data
(Burrough et al. 2001).
The SKATER algorithm is a regionalization algorithm that imposes graph-based
spatial constraints on the k-means algorithm (Assunção et al. 2006). Unlike Lloyd’s
algorithm (Lloyd 1982), SKATER only assigns spatially contiguous and similar
objects to the same cluster. Regionalization has vast uses in geospatial analysis,
10
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
367
including analysis of gerrymandering, healthcare services (Church and Barker 1998)
and resource allocation (Or and Pierskalla 1979).
Clustering and regionalization were applied to the same dataset to juxtapose the
types of patterns they expose in the data and the resulting understanding gained using
these two methods. The average temperature in the United States in June 2012 was
used. The resulting clusters and regions are displayed below.
The regionalization and clustering results in Fig. 10.7 show similarities in the
overall temperature patterns, which change N-S in the eastern portion of the US
and W-E in the western portion. Notably, the k-means result in Fig. 10.7b displays
isolated patches whereas the regionalization result has spatially contiguous regions.
Due to the constrained optimization scheme to satisfy the spatial constraints, the
regions deﬁned by regionalization have a higher variance than those in the k-means
result. However, both maps display similarities in the temperature and the extent to
which these similarities can be aggregated into homogeneous zones.
10.2.2.2
Autoencoders
Another very useful and common machine learning technique is autoencoders
(Rumelhart et al. 1985). In an autoencoder, the data passes through a bottleneck,
where the bottleneck is a lower representation of the same data. Autoencoders are
made of two neural networks called the encoder and decoder (Fig. 10.8). The encoder
receives data D, maps it to a lower space and obtains L; a decoder receives L, maps
it back to the same dimension of D and obtains D’. The distance between D and D’,
which is called the reconstruction loss, should be minimized. A direct application
of autoencoders is in compression, in which one can reduce the dimension of D to
L and work with L and the decoder instead of the data D in its native resolution.
Autoencoders have also been used in geospatial applications to ﬁnd water bodies
(Zhiyin et al. 2015) or denoise satellite images (Liang et al. 2017).
Machine learning techniques are not limited to the list of applications and methods
provided here. Several variations of these methods as well as many other standalone
techniques have been successfully employed in the Digital Earth, geoscience and
remote sensing ﬁelds. For a more in-depth and comprehensive study, refer to the
work of Lary et al. (2016).
10.2.3
Dimension Reduction
There have been extensive efforts to learn the patterns and forms that data sets
contain. It is possible to predict the behavior of a data set and/or compress the data
set into a more compact form for transmission, storage, and retrieval. In addition
to autoencoders that can be used for dimensionality reduction, one of the easiest
methods for compression and dimensionality reduction for a given data set and
subsequent prediction of its behavior for unknown data points is linear regression.

to learn a lower dimension
(hidden/latent space; gray
neurons) representation of
the data. The decoder
attempts to reconstruct the
data (red neurons) as closely
as possible to the given data
In the 2D case of this method, the data points attain two coordinates, and the line
that best represents these data sets is considered as the model representative of the
data. The best representation can have different meanings, including the line that
has the smallest least square distance with all the data points. Regression, linear or
nonlinear, has been a great tool to analyze spatial data. Belae et al. (2010) provided
a survey of regression techniques used to represent and analyze spatial datasets. For
Digital Earth platforms, Mahdavi-Amiri et al. (2018) combined regression with a
wavelet to transmit quantitative datasets on a discrete global grid system (DGGS).
10.2.3.1
PCA
Another form of linear representation of a data set is principal component analysis
(PCA). In this representation, the covariance matrix of the data is initially formed by
applying the inner product of a data matrix A in its transpose

Cov = AT A

. The
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, λi, represent the main trends of the data. If we
have a data set forming an ellipsoid in 2D, the eigenvectors are the two main axes of
the ellipsoid. Figure 10.9 represents PCA in 2D. PCA has been extensively used in
370
E. Guérin et al.
Fig. 10.9 PCA ﬁnds the
main trends of the data. The
data points illustrated in
yellow have two main trends
x′ and y′ that are the
eigenvectors associated with
the largest eigenvalues of the
covariance of the data
many applications including computer graphics, computer vision, and data science.
PCA has been used in different applications related to geospatial data representa-
tion and geospatial data analysis (Demšar et al. 2013). For instance, PCA has been
successfully used to study drought areas (Gocic and Trajkovic 2014), evaluate water
quality (Parinet et al. 2004), and distinguish vegetation (Panda et al. 2009).
10.2.3.2
SVD
Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a decomposition that reveals important infor-
mation about a matrix. In SVD, a matrix A is decomposed into the form U SV T , in
which U and V are two rotation matrices and S is a diagonal scale matrix with values
called the singular values, σi, of matrix A. There is a direct connection between
PCA and SVD because the singular values of the singular value decomposition of
data matrix A are the square root of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix that is
found in PCA

σi = √λi

. To compress or denoise data, it is possible to zero out
small eigenvalues obtained by SVD and keep important portions of the data. SVD
has been extensively employed in image processing applications (Sadek 2012). It
has also been used in geospatial applications. For instance, Wieland and Dalchow
(2009) used SVD to detect landscape forms, and Dvorsky et al. (2009) used SVD to
determine the similarity between maps.

10.2.3.3
Evolutionary and Agent-Based Techniques
Evolutionary and Agent-based techniques have also been extensively used to perform
analyses of geospatial data sets. Two important algorithms are genetic algorithms
(GAs) and ant colony optimization (ACO).
In GAs, a set of random solutions is initially produced and these solutions are
considered parents to make a new generation of solutions based on three rules:
Selection rulesthatselectparentsbasedontheirﬁtness,Crossover rulesthatcombine
two parents to generate children for the next generation, and Mutation rules that
apply random changes to parents to form children (Mitchel 1998). GAs have been
used in many applications in geospatial data analysis such as road detection (Jeon
et al. 2002) and satellite image segmentation (Mohanta and Binapani 2011).
ACO is an optimization technique that works based in an agent-based environ-
ment. In this stochastic environment, the ants are agents that walk over a certain
solution path and leave a track called a pheromone. Paths with more pheromone are
usually more optimal (shortest) than others, and they attract more agents. A classic
problem that can be solved by ACO is the travelling salesman problem. ACO has
been successfully employed to solve other types of hard problems including those
involving geospatial data analysis. For instance, ACO has been used for path plan-
ning considering trafﬁc (Hsiao et al. 2004) and road extraction from raster data sets
(Maboudi et al. 2017).
10.3
Deep Learning
When a large amount of data is involved and/or a complex model for representing the
data is used, it is common to employ deep learning methods (Goodfellow et al. 2016).
Digital earth data represents a massive amount of data, for example, high-precision
digital elevation models or aerial photography. Because the rules that produce this
kind of data are very complex and involve many natural or human processes, it can be
difﬁcult to apply standard learning models or algorithms and retain this complexity.
Thus, the deep models described in this section are relevant.
10.3.1
Convolutional Networks
Deep learning has been popularized by image processing applications. In this con-
text, the processed data is arranged into a regular grid and is adapted to so-called
convolutional layers. Data extracted from Digital Earth can be of this nature by
construction. For example, raster data such as digital elevation models or aerial pho-
tography images are already arranged into regular grids and can be processed out
of the box with convolutional layers. Convolutional neural networks rely on the fact
that the same processing can be applied to different parts of the image. Traditional

Fully connected layer
Convolutional layer
Fig. 10.10 Convolutional layers use fewer coefﬁcients and are spatialized
fully connected schemes for neural network layers use many coefﬁcients that can be
spared with convolutional layers and used in other features. Figure 10.10 compares
the principle of a convolutional layer to that of a traditionally fully connected layer.
Both examples show an input of size 9. While a fully connected layer uses 27 coefﬁ-
cients to produce an output of size 3, the convolutional layer can produce 9 outputs
from only 3 different coefﬁcients. This means that the same feature extraction is per-
formed but at different locations, which is relatively close to traditional convolution
in the discrete domain.
Recently, a convolutional network was used to infer the super-resolution of a dig-
ital elevation model by using aerial photography (Argudo et al. 2018). Figure 10.11
shows the architecture of this network. This work comes from the observation that
publicly available high-resolution DEMs (resolution less than 2 m) do not cover
the full Earth whereas it is possible to ﬁnd high-resolution imagery (orthophotos)
with good coverage of the Earth. Many applications require a ﬁne resolution for
the DEM, and Argudo et al. proposed inserting details into a coarse DEM using
inferred information drawn from the high-resolution orthophoto of the same foot-
print (Fig. 10.12). Basically, the method produces a DEM with 2 m precision from
a DEM with 15 m precision and an orthophoto with 1 m precision. To produce this
result, a fully convolutional network was used.
In the literature, a full system to automatically infer street addresses from satellite
imagery was proposed (Demir et al. 2018a). One step that must be performed is
the extraction of roads from the satellite images. This was done using a modiﬁed

version of SegNet, a convolutional network primarily used for image segmentation.
In this architecture, the input and output resolutions are identical, and the network
consists of several encoder layers that decrease the resolution followed by decoders
that increase the resolution. The network is trained using manually labeled 192 ×
192 pixel images, in which a binary road mask is associated with each pixel of the
image to indicate if the pixel belongs to a road or not. Figure 10.13 shows an example
of the results obtained in automatic extraction of the road information compared with
the ground truth.
More generally, automatic processing of satellite images with a deep learning
approach appears to be very efﬁcient in segmentation and feature extraction. The
DeepGlobe project (http://deepglobe.org) aims to challenge authors to use deep
learning for three applications: road extraction, building detection and land cover
classiﬁcation (Demir et al. 2018b).

Recurrent Neural Networks
While convolutional neural networks and dense neural networks work well for static
data in which there is no sense of time, a recurrent neural network (RNN) (Jain and
Medsker 1999) processes data by iterating through the input elements and maintain-
ing a state that contains information relative to what it has seen until then. An RNN
is a neural network with an internal loop (see Fig. 10.14). The state of the RNN is
updated between processing independent sequences; therefore, we still consider one
data sequence as a single data point in the network. The difference is that this data
point is not processed in a single step as opposed to those in dense or convolutional
neural networks. In an RNN, the network internally loops over sequence elements
until it learns the ﬂow of the data. An RNN is helpful when dealing with a temporal
data set. In geospatial data analysis, an RNN has been recently applied in interest-
ing applications such as correction of satellite image classiﬁcation (Maggiori et al.
2017) and land cover classiﬁcation (Ienco et al. 2017). Since many types of geospa-
tial data sets such as weather, satellite images, or seasonal animal behavior have
timing attached to them, we expect that RNNs will be widely used in the analysis of
geospatial data sets in the near future and that Digital Earth will beneﬁt from such
networks.
10.3.3
Variational Autoencoder
Deep neural networks are useful to analyze data sets and are also helpful in generating
new data sets. It is possible to consider two deep neural networks as the encoder and
decoder of an autoencoder and produce a latent space that represents the data. Using
only L and an encoder, we can reproduce a lossy representation of D. However, it
10
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
375
is not possible to pick a vector in L and expect to reproduce a meaningful result by
feeding it to the encoder because the distribution of L is unknown if autoencoders are
used. In variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling 2014), in addition
to the compression loss, another loss is minimized that forces the L to be a Gaussian
distribution. Thus, VAEs can be used as a generative neural network in which one
can sample the Gaussian distribution and feed it to the encoder to generate a new
shape that does not necessarily belong to the training data set. Although VAEs have
potential to generate data and learn low-dimensional data for geospatial data sets,
VAEs have not been extensively tested for geospatial data analysis and generation.
10.3.4
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Similar to VAEs, generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014)
are also generative models. GANs consist of a pair of networks that have two differ-
ent and adversarial roles. These networks have a convolutional architecture and are
often complex to retain the complexity of the underlying models. The ﬁrst network is
a generator that we denote as G, which attempts to generate the best result, for exam-
ple, an image. Then, the second network takes the image as input and tries to infer if
it is a generated image or not. This second network is called a discriminator and we
denote it as D. Both G and D are trained alternatively. The objective of G is to fool D
whereas D aims to avoid being fooled by G. The strength of this kind of adversarial
formalism is that it is equivalent to use of a very complex function to train the gener-
ator G (encoded into the discriminator), far more complex than traditional distance
would be.
Conditional GANs (cGANs) are GANs with a particular setup in which the dis-
criminator is trained to recognize the matching between an input image A and an
output B whereas a traditional GAN only tests the plausibility of the output with-
out any knowledge of the input. The training principle of a cGAN is explained in
Fig. 10.15.
Fig. 10.15 cGAN principle: a training pair (A, B) is used to learn positive examples. For negative
examples, only A is used together with the generator to form the pair (A, G(A))
376
E. Guérin et al.
Conditional GANs have recently been used to automatically generate digital ele-
vation models from user sketches (Guérin et al. 2017). The user sketches the river
network, the crests and some altitude cues and obtains a plausible terrain that matches
the given constraints, based on a training dataset made of sketch/terrain pairs. The
method consists of building such a dataset by extracting the sketch from a real-world
terrain. The difﬁculty of this kind of setup is to automatically build a sketch that is
compatible with user sketches, i.e., similar to what a user would draw. Building a
sketch that is too close to the terrain features will force the user to draw very precisely,
which is not relevant in a sketching context but would be useful in a reconstruction
process. The digital elevation model must be simpliﬁed to produce simpler features.
In their work, Guérin et al. propose initially downsampling the digital elevation
model and then smoothing it. This coarse digital elevation model is then processed
by a ﬂow simulation, from which the skeleton is extracted. The same process is
applied to extract ridges. This feature extraction is illustrated in Fig. 10.16.
The training dataset is formed of pairs that describe the matching between the
sketch and the terrain. Figure 10.17 gives examples of such pairs. To create a more
pliable terrain synthesizer, the sketches randomly include one, two or the three fea-
tures among the river lines, crest lines and altitude cues.
Figure 10.18 shows examples of outputs produced by the DEM generator from
sketches. The results were obtained by using training from a DEM extracted from
the NASA SRTM dataset at 1 arc-second from different locations in the United

States. In the same article, the authors proposed the use of the same principle to
automatically generate digital elevation models from a single level set sketch. They
also described examples of automatic void ﬁlling in digital elevation models. Finally,
because cGANs can embed very complex models, they used it to mimic an erosion
process.
10.3.5
Dictionary-Based Approaches
Approaches based on base function decompositions have intrinsic limitations. Base
functions are usually used because they have orthogonality properties that lead to an
efﬁcient decomposition. Selecting the base can be difﬁcult because it heavily depends
on the nature of the signal. Thus, it can be a viable option to use dictionary-based
descriptions. A signal is represented as a linear combination of atoms from a dictio-
nary. Atoms do not need to have special properties such as orthogonality. They are
typically chosen directly from the data by picking the most representative signals or
by using an optimization. A survey of dictionary-based methods for 3D modeling was
conducted by Lescoat et al. (2018). One of the applications of dictionary-based mod-
eling is called sparse modeling, which adds an additional constraint on the number
of atoms used to represent the ﬁnal signal, called sparsity.
10.3.5.1
Dictionary Decomposition
Given a dictionary, the decomposition of a signal consists of ﬁnding the best atom,
i.e., the atom that maximizes the projection. Then, the same process is applied itera-
tively to the residual until reaching the target sparsity. This process is called matching
pursuit and was introduced by Mallat and Zhang (1993). This decomposition algo-
rithm was further improved by Cai and Wang (2011) by introducing the Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The main difference is that the best decompo-
sition of the already-found atoms is recomputed after each new atom is found.

using a dictionary-based approach. The original terrain had a precision of 1 km, and successive
ampliﬁcations by a factor of 4 increase the precision to 4 m
10.3.5.2
Dictionary Optimization
One aim of dictionary based approaches is to ﬁnd a dictionary that is adapted to a
given context or set of signals. This can be done by an optimization process. One
goal of this optimization is to minimize the reconstruction error, for example, by
computing an L2 distance between the reconstructed signal and the original. It is
common to add a constraint on the type of decomposition, for example, by setting
a maximum sparsity. Unfortunately, the optimization problem under this type of
constraint is too difﬁcult to solve in an optimal way. Heuristics have been proposed
that lead to good results with a relatively low cost. K-SVD is one of these algorithms
(Aharon et al. 2006), which consists of iterating between two steps. The ﬁrst step
consists of optimizing the decomposition, which can be done using a standard OMP
algorithm. The second step optimizes the dictionary with respect to the previously
computed decomposition. The two steps are repeated until a number of iterations is
reached or a given error is obtained.
Several applications of sparse modeling with terrains have been proposed by
Guérin et al. (2016) and Argudo et al. (2018). The terrain is decomposed into patches
that compose input signals. A so-called ampliﬁcation process is used to introduce
plausibledetailsintotheterrainbymappingbetweenlow-resolutionandhi-resolution
atoms. The dictionary is drawn from an exemplar terrain at high resolution and
automatically transformed into low resolution by a trivial downsampling process.
The ampliﬁcation algorithm simply decomposes the patches from a given terrain in
the low-resolution dictionary and uses the corresponding high-resolution atoms to
reconstruct it. Because the dictionary has been extracted from real terrain, the added
details are plausible and realistic, as shown in Fig. 10.19.
10.3.6
Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning(RL)isapowerfullearningmethodindynamicenvironments
(Sutton and Barto 1998). In RL, there is usually an agent in an environment and the
agent receives rewards based on its actions. The ﬁnal goal is to learn how to take
actions to maximize the rewards. At any time t, an environment is deﬁned by states St
in which an agent can take action At and change the environment state to St+1. When
10
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
379
Fig. 10.20 An agent receives state s_t, performs an action and receives reward r_t from the envi-
ronment. The state of the environment changes to s_(t+1). This process continues until a terminal
state is achieved
the agent takes action At, the environment receives a reward rt. These iterations
continue until the environment reaches a terminal state (Fig. 10.20). Examples of
applications that RL can be extremely useful for are games or robot locomotion in
which more points and more stable states are the rewards of the game and locomotion
environments, respectively.
RL has also been used in applications in GIS and geospatial data analysis. For
instance, RL has been used to model land cover changes (Bone and Dragicevic 2009).
With recent advances in RL and the growth of computational power, we expect that
RL will receive more attention from the GIS and Digital Earth communities. For
instance, one application of RL can be to simulate the behavior of endangered species
in different simulated environments.

Discussion
In the past, machine learning has seen hypes and winter seasons. It started with sym-
bolic AI in the 1960s, which claimed the ability to make machines with intelligence
comparable to an average human being in less than a decade. However, people soon
realized that they were far from reaching that point. In the 1980s, with the rise of
expert systems, similar hype was seen in the area of machine learning, followed by a
winter season due to the lack of generality of expert systems and their high mainte-
nance costs (Chollet 2017). Recently, deep learning methods became popular again
and showed great success in different areas of computer science including geospatial
analysis, which is an important portion of Digital Earth platforms. Deep learning
will likely continue to grow and be applied more in this ﬁeld, especially because
of the availability of computational power and big data sets that help create more
powerful models. However, deep learning cannot solve all problems. For instance,
current deep learning models are unable to solve problems that require reasoning or
long-term planning (Chollet 2017). Deep learning models work extremely well in
380

mapping an input to a desired output with very little human-level knowledge about
the input or output and their effect on industry and science will probably remain for
a very long time. There is plenty of discussion about the future of deep learning and
AI, notably by its great pioneers such as Lecun et al. (2015) and in the European
perspective on AI (Craglia et al. 2018).
Artiﬁcial intelligence and particularly machine learning and deep learning have
greatpotentialtocontributetothegeneration,analysis,andmanagementofgeospatial
data sets. Digital Earth should beneﬁt from such opportunities, as a place holder
to represent such data sets and a platform to analyze them. Since Digital Earth
is constantly receiving geospatial data sets, a successful Digital Earth should use
reliable, fast, and comprehensive techniques to manage and make use of such data.
Deep Learning techniques show promise in these directions. However, there are still
issues in their use in Digital Earth platforms that must be addressed. In the following
sections, we discuss some of these issues.
10.4.1
Reproducibility
If a technique such as a deep neural network produces particular results, such results
should be reproduceable by others. Placing the code on GitHub and providing free
access to data sets have been helpful for this issue. However, there are still some
issues, especially when the data are owned by a company or the network was designed
by an industrial team. In particular neural network architectures, randomness can be
included, usually to improve the training. When this randomness is also present in
the operational network, it can disrupt the reproducibility of results.
10.4.2
Ownership and Fairness
Ownership of artifacts provided by machine learning techniques is also heavily under
question. If a person with almost no knowledge about a network takes information
fromavailablesources,modiﬁesafewparameters,takesdatafromanavailablesource
and produces something unique or obtains a certain analysis, who is the owner of
such results? The data owner, developer of the network, or the person who combined
these ingredients? In more serious scenarios, who is at fault when a system that works
based on machine learning techniques makes a catastrophic mistake or performs a
discriminatoryactionthatmayinvolveracismorsexism?Anotherquestioniswhether
data sets and computation power are available to everyone, i.e., do we have “data
democratization”? Fortunately, the wealth of free access data sets and code bases
along with cheap computational power such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) have
resolved some of these issues but we are still far from perfect.
10
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
381
10.4.3
Accountability
Due to the nature of some algorithms involved in machine learning, it usually cannot
be used in contexts where accountability is a strong constraint. This is especially the
case with deep neural networks where a lot of information is hidden in the layers,
which can lead to unexpected and unwanted results. Conversely, traditional machine
learning methods such as linear regressions or PCA are very reliable even if they are
limited in terms of applications. Reasonably, one could consider using deep learning
methods only when traditional methods fail or are lacking.
10.5
Conclusion
In conclusion, we provided a sampling of artiﬁcial intelligence techniques and their
applications in geospatial data generation, analysis, and management. We discussed
how AI can be beneﬁcial for generating new terrain data sets, identifying roads and
analyzing various geospatial data sets such as satellite imagery. AI techniques and
deep learning methods appear very promising. Extensive research on these topics
will likely make them even more suitable for use in different domains including
geospatial analysis and Digital Earth. However, these techniques are unfortunately
standalone and have not been integrated into a Digital Earth platform that makes use
of such techniques. Appropriate artiﬁcial intelligence techniques should be meticu-
lously included in Digital Earth, considering their pros and cons including fairness
and bias to provide interactive, comprehensive and meaningful analysis to users.

Abstract Digital Earth was born with the aim of replicating the real world within
the digital world. Many efforts have been made to observe and sense the Earth, both
from space (remote sensing) and by using in situ sensors. Focusing on the latter,
advances in Digital Earth have established vital bridges to exploit these sensors and
their networks by taking location as a key element. The current era of connectivity
envisions that everything is connected to everything. The concept of the Internet of
Things (IoT) emerged as a holistic proposal to enable an ecosystem of varied, hetero-
geneous networked objects and devices to speak to and interact with each other. To
make the IoT ecosystem a reality, it is necessary to understand the electronic com-
ponents, communication protocols, real-time analysis techniques, and the location
of the objects and devices. The IoT ecosystem and the Digital Earth (DE) jointly
form interrelated infrastructures for addressing today’s pressing issues and complex
challenges. In this chapter, we explore the synergies and frictions in establishing
an efﬁcient and permanent collaboration between the two infrastructures, in order
to adequately address multidisciplinary and increasingly complex real-world prob-
lems. Although there are still some pending issues, the identiﬁed synergies generate
optimism for a true collaboration between the Internet of Things and the Digital
Earth.

Introduction
According to Jayavardhana (Gubbi et al. 2013), the term Internet of Things (IoT) was
ﬁrst coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in the context of supply chain management.
Empowered by the latest advances in Information and Communication Technology
(ICT), the IoT is revolutionizing the world, opening new possibilities and offering
solutions that were unthinkable even only a few years ago. The concept of the IoT
is highly multidisciplinary because it brings together a wide variety of technologies,
protocols, applications, scenarios, and disciplines (Atzori et al. 2010; Gubbi et al.
2013). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Standardisation Sector
deﬁnes it as ‘a global infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced
services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) Things based on existing and
evolving interoperable information and communication technologies’ (International
Telecommunication Union 2018). As an infrastructure, the IoT can be seen as a
broader system involving data, resources, standards and communication protocols
as well as theoretical studies.
The pace of IoT development seems quite fast, with continuous proposals of new
approaches, applications, and use case scenarios, increasing the presence of IoT
in multiple and varied applications, and aspects of daily life. To date, smart devices
constitute the IoT’s most visible form, applied in a wide range of scenarios and sectors
such as cities, industry, commerce, agriculture, home, and mobility. Although we are
far from the 200 trillion smart devices as predicted by 2020 (Intel, n.d.), signiﬁcant
progress has been made in this direction. Estimates suggest that there will be 26
smart devices per person in 2020, 40.2% of which will be located in the business
environment (termed Industry 4.0).
According to the Forbes analyst Daniel Newman (Newman 2017), the IoT is one
of the most rapidly evolving trends today, especially in three development lines:
the analytics arena, the development of edge computing, and the deployment of
5G networks. As 5G technology is progressively implemented and deployed (Shaﬁ
et al. 2017), the current analysis platforms will need adaptation in order to analyze
effectively the large amount of data ﬂows acquired, produced by IoT devices with
increasingly more powerful built-in sensors and emerging real-time analysis func-
tions, empowered even more by the rapid emergence and (parallel) development of
edge computing (Shi et al. 2016).
Edge computing is a recent paradigm motivated by bandwidth limitations between
the producer (smart objects) and consumer parts (cloud server), as well as the need for
improved performance in computing and consumer smart objects. The main feature
of edge computing is that data can be processed locally in smart devices rather than
being sent to the cloud for further processing.
Like the IoT, Digital Earth (DE) also entails an infrastructure. Al Gore, at his
famous speech in 1998 (Gore 1998), introduced the concept of a DE with the vision
of extending the real Earth with a digital/virtual replica or counterpart. Over the last
two decades, many geographic phenomena and observations have been converted
11
Internet of Things
389
to digital data to be used, analyzed, and visualized using digital tools such as vir-
tual globes (Butler 2006). In this chapter, we use the term DE to refer to a network
infrastructure that allows for the discovery, access, analysis, and processing of spa-
tially referenced data. For more details on DE, we refer the reader to Schade et al.
(2013). In particular, Schade et al. describe the origins and evolving concepts of terms
such as DE, Geographic Information Infrastructures and Spatial Data Infrastructures,
together with their theoretical and technical features.
This chapter takes a technological perspective focusing on the description of the
current relationships between DE and the IoT, identifying ongoing efforts, potential
synergies and bridges, as well as existing limitations and barriers that prevent both
infrastructures from collaborating and communicating in practical terms. Instead
of operating in parallel, scientists and researchers need the IoT and DE to work
jointly by establishing an efﬁcient and permanent collaboration to adequately address
the multi-disciplinary nature and growing complexity of the pressing problems that
characterize modern science.
The rest of the chapter is divided into ﬁve sections. In Sect. 11.2, we provide an
overview of the most frequent deﬁnitions of the IoT, describe our working deﬁnitions
throughout this chapter, and brieﬂy review related work in the interplay of the IoT and
theDE.InSect.11.3,weanalyzetheexistinginterplaybetweenbothinfrastructuresin
thecontextofthemain,high-levelfunctionsofDE.Then,anoverviewofrelevantcase
studies across several smart scenarios in which the symbiosis of the IoT and DE could
lead to beneﬁcial results is provided in Sect. 11.4. Afterwards, Sect. 11.5 analyses the
frictions and possible synergies today and in the future. Finally, concluding remarks
and emerging trends for the immediate future are provided in Sect. 11.6.
11.2
Deﬁnitions and status quo of the IoT
This section deﬁnes the current state of the IoT with respect to the concept of the
DE. The ﬁrst subsection examines the different deﬁnitions of a ‘Thing’, adopted by
standardization organizations, followed by our working deﬁnition for this chapter.
The last subsection describes related works in which interaction between IoT and
DE is the main goal.
11.2.1
One Concept, Many Deﬁnitions
The concept of a ‘Thing’ may seem generic. A ‘Thing’ can be characterized as
a network object or entity that can connect to the Internet directly or through a
network gateway. This exempliﬁes a network-centric perspective of the IoT in which
a variety of interrelated ‘Things’ are able to communicate with each other to deliver
new applications and services (Atzori et al. 2010). In contrast to the network-centric
vision focusing on the communication technologies being used, the IoT can be seen
390
C. Granell et al.
from a purely Thing-centric perspective in which the services associated with Things
are pivotal. These services are expected to manage large amounts of data captured
by smart objects or ‘Things’ as a result of interacting with the environment.
Regardless of the vision, the deﬁnition of the term ‘Thing’ is extensive and
includes a wide variety of physical elements. Examples of these elements include: (i)
personal objects such as smartphones, smart watches or bands; (ii) ordinary objects
and appliances in our daily lives such as refrigerators, lights, cars, and windows; (iii)
other identiﬁable objects equipped with Radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags,
Near-ﬁeld communication (NFC), or Quick Response (QR) codes; and (iv) objects
equipped with small microcontrollers.
Because of the heterogeneity of the technology and hardware, there is no sin-
gle, uniﬁed deﬁnition of the term ‘Thing’. Different international standardization
bodies and organizations have suggested a deﬁnition, resulting in multiple interpre-
tations of the concepts of Things and the IoT, which sometimes differ only slightly.
Consequently, each stakeholder group may have a particular view of what the IoT
and Things are, as demonstrated below by the deﬁnitions of some internationally
renowned organizations.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization whose
aim is the collaborative development of Web standards, deﬁnes a ‘Thing’ as ‘the
abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that needs to be represented in IoT appli-
cations. This entity can be a device, a logical component of a device, a local hardware
component, or even a logical entity such as a location (e.g., room or building)’ (Kaji-
moto et al. 2017).
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a global profes-
sional engineering organization whose mission is to foster technological innovations
and excellence for the beneﬁt of humanity, deﬁnes a ‘Thing’ as a device with pro-
grammable capabilities. In contrast to the W3C’s deﬁnition, the IEEE’s deﬁnition
takes a more practical engineering view of Things, driven by two deﬁning features:
(i) Things have the ability to communicate technologically, and (ii) Things have the
ability to connect to or integrate in an already connected environment. This net-
working capability can be based on microcontrollers such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
BeagleBone and PCDuino, among others.
The European Research Cluster on the Internet of Things (IERC) describes Things
as ‘physical and virtual things with identities, physical attributes, and virtual person-
alities and smart user interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the information
network.’ (IERC 2014). Similarly, considering that Things belong to a network, the
ITU introduces the term infrastructure and deﬁnes the IoT as “a global infrastructure
for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical
and virtual) things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and
communication technologies” (ITU-T 2012). In addition, the ITU recognizes three
interdependent dimensions that characterize Things (Fig. 11.1). This indicates the
versatility of the IoT in application domains that differ in terms of the requirements
and user needs.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open international community
of network designers, researchers, and operators concerned with the evolution of the
11
Internet of Things
391
Fig. 11.1 Dimensions of the IoT (inspired in ITU-T 2012)
IoT, takes a broad perspective of Things in the context of the IoT, contemplating that
“‘things’ are very varied such as computers, sensors, people, actuators, refrigerators,
TVs, vehicles, mobile phones, clothes, food, medicines, books, etc. These things are
classiﬁed into three scopes: people, machines (for example, sensor, actuator, etc.)
and information (for example, clothes, food, medicine, books, etc.). These ‘things’
should be identiﬁed at least by one unique way of identiﬁcation for the capability
of addressing and communicating with each other and verifying their identities. In
here, if the ‘thing’ is identiﬁed, we call it the ‘object’” (Minerva et al. 2015).
Finally, the Organisation for the Advancement of Structured Information Stan-
dards (OASIS), a nonproﬁt consortium that drives the development, convergence and
adoption of open standards for the global information society, describes the IoT as a
‘system where the Internet is connected to the physical world via ubiquitous sensors’
(Cosgrove-Sacks 2014). OASIS focuses on the ubiquity of sensors, as they exist in
‘every mobile, every auto, every door, every room, every part, on every parts list,
every sensor in every device in every bed, chair or bracelet in every home, ofﬁce,
building or hospital room in every city and village on Earth’.
In Fig. 11.2 we categorize the aforementioned IoT deﬁnitions based on physical,
virtual and location considerations. The deﬁnitions reveal that these institutions and
organizations consider the IoT from a physical point of view. In addition to the
physical view, three organizations (ITU, IERC and W3C) add a virtual connotation
to the deﬁnition of a ‘Thing’. Only the W3C deﬁnition acknowledges explicitly
location as a deﬁning element of the IoT.

11.2.2
Our Deﬁnition
After analyzing the different deﬁnitions of internationally renowned institutions and
standardization organizations, we propose our interpretation of the term ‘Thing’ that
will be used throughout the rest of the chapter. This deﬁnition aims to (i) relate the
IoT to DE, and (ii) be as broad as possible.
From our perspective, three main features characterize a ‘Thing’: (i) networked
communication; (ii) programmability (data processing and storage); and (iii) sensing
and/or actuating capabilities. From a DE perspective, the third feature plays a more
prominentrole.Thesensingand/oractuatingcapabilitiespermitanIoTdeviceornode
to interact with its environment. This environment is closely related to the location
feature, since all Things will intrinsically have this feature as a property, which
increases in importance when the ‘Thing’ has a mobile component. Contrary to most
of the deﬁnitions above, we consider a Thing’s location as a crucial characteristic
because it impacts how a ‘Thing’ can communicate and how it can interact with its
environment. However, we argue that the physical point of view can be understood to
include location implicitly, as a physical sensor is located somewhere in the physical
world.
11.2.3
Early Works on the Interplay Between DE and the IoT
As noted above, this chapter explores potential bridges between the IoT and DE for
the development of applications and services that take advantage of the beneﬁts of
11
Internet of Things
393
both infrastructures to effectively address complex research issues. In this context,
we brieﬂy summarize studies related to this objective.
In 1999, Gross predicted that electronic devices would populate the Earth and have
the ability to capture different types of information, forming an ‘electronic skin’
(Gross 1999). These devices would be able to communicate through the Internet,
and include meteorological or pollution sensors, cameras, blood pressure sensors or
microphones, among others. The imagined ‘electronic skin’ could be in contact with
what was happening in different scenarios and places on Earth, in the atmosphere,
cities, houses, or even in ourselves.
Gross’ vision is gradually becoming a reality. There is great variability in the form,
size and purpose of sensors in wireless networks. Such Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSN) enable distributed communication and data sharing between sensor network
nodes. From this perspective, WSN form a subset of the IoT and, as such, the IoT
can be seen as the logical next step of WSN in a progression that is still evolving
in terms of the sophistication, variability in functionality, ﬂexibility and integration
with other infrastructures and network protocols (e.g., the Internet Protocol).
The IoT gained popularity between 2008 and 2013 (Fig. 11.3), and all organiza-
tions concerned with WSN began to focus on the IoT. The matured technology of
WSN was applied to IoT developments, and DE organizations were not an excep-
tion. The ﬁeld of sensors and sensor networks has been the object of study from
multiple and varied angles, including the geospatial community, especially the Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The OGC started to transfer improvements made in
the deﬁnition and application of standards and speciﬁcations in the ﬁeld of WSN to
the IoT.
The most signiﬁcant OGC contribution concerning sensors and WSN has been
the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards suite (see Sect. 11.2.4 below). SWE
enables the discovery and access of sensors and associated observational data through
standard protocols and application programming interfaces (API) (Botts et al. 2008).
The SWE standards have been applied directly to many application domains in DE.

C. Granell et al.
The shared goal was to observe a particular phenomenon, for example, to predict
emergency warnings or ﬁre alarms or alerts when an event is triggered (Wang and
Yuan 2010). For example, SWE has been widely applied to different Earth Obser-
vation (EO) application domains, with disaster management being one of the most
important and well-developed. One of the early applications was the use of sensor
web techniques to monitor natural and man-made hazards such as ﬁres (Trilles et al.
2014; Jirka et al. 2009; Brakenridge et al. 2003), ﬂoods (Brakenridge et al. 2003),
and volcanic eruptions (Song et al. 2008).
In parallel with the concept of WSN, Ashton (2009) noted that the term IoT was
ﬁrst used in his work entitled “I made at Procter & Gamble” in 1999. Back then, the
IoT was associated with the use of RFID technology. However, the term WSN was
not yet the focus of much interest, as shown in Fig. 11.3.
Some studies explored the connection between the IoT and DE concepts. Li and
his colleagues studied the impact of the IoT on DE and analyzed the transition to
Smart Earth (Li et al. 2014). The concept was introduced in 2009 during a panel
discussion with the U.S. president and U.S. business leaders. In that panel, IBM’s
CEO Sam Palmisano requested that countries should invest in a new generation of
smart infrastructure, with crucial use of sensors, suggesting the concept of ‘Smart
Earth’ as a name. Subsequent governments showed interest in adopting this type of
technology, and are making huge investments in researching and developing smart
devices (e.g., the ‘Array of Things’ in Chicago, https://arrayofthings.github.io).
The primary objective of a ‘Smart Earth’ is to make full use of ICT and the IoT,
and apply them in different ﬁelds (Bakker and Ritts 2018). In a ‘Smart Earth’, IoT
devices are placed in all possible locations of our daily life, as long as our privacy
can be respected. Through the combination of the IoT, DE, and cloud computing,
globally deployed physical objects and sensors can be accessible online. The idea of
a ‘Smart Earth’ is ambitious and includes remote sensing, GIS and network technol-
ogy in combination with DE platforms (see Chap. 2 in this book featuring “Digital
Earth Platforms”). The goal is to enable sustainable social development, which is a
visionary step that is still utopian today, towards the establishment of a global infor-
mation infrastructure to support UN Sustainable Development Goals (see Chap. 13
“Digital Earth for Sustainable Development Goals in this book,”).
The work by Van der Zee and Scholten (2014) highlighted the importance of loca-
tion in the concept of the IoT. The authors noted that space and time can play a role as
‘glue’, to enable an efﬁcient connection between smart devices; therefore, geospatial
sciences should have an active presence in the development of IoT architecture. In
their study, Van der Zee and Scholten described a set of technologies related to the
geospatial domain and big data analysis that could be combined with the IoT. The
authors concluded that these technologies were already available for application in
the ﬁeld of the IoT and recommended their immediate use. However, the authors
also identiﬁed the lack of IT professionals with knowledge in geospatial sciences as
the main obstacle in massive uptake of the IoT for geo-related applications. They
proposed to address this limitation through a gradual incorporation of core geospatial
skills and competences into IT curricula.
11
Internet of Things
395
Our aim in this chapter is to move beyond the initial steps and thoughts presented
in Van der Zee and Scholten (2014), where the status quo of the IoT and DE was
described ﬁve years ago. We focus on the ‘current status quo’ by outlining emerging
technology trends that can be crucial for establishing real connections between DE
and the IoT, and investigate developments during the last ﬁve years in particular.
Even though development has been gradual and incremental, and not rapid and
revolutionary (i.e. from a GIScience perspective), new requirements and technology
trends have appeared and the IoT has become a topic that is undoubtedly gaining
increasing traction.
11.2.4
IoT Standards Initiatives from DE
As noted above, the IoT ecosystem has been very diverse for several years (Atzori
et al. 2010), and its diversity has been increasing. It is comprised of heterogeneous
devices, protocols and architectural approaches. A plethora of international initia-
tives are put in place to unify and streamline aspects associated with the design and
implementation of IoT infrastructures. The current standardization initiatives address
aspects related to discoverability, data transmission, device processing and tasking.
The growing number of interconnected devices, combined with the increasing
importanceoftheuseoftheIoTinalmostanyaspectofhumanlife,tendtoincreasethe
need and importance of mature, well-established and -implemented standards. The
diversity of different standardization initiatives provides designers and developers
with a broad range of opportunities that do not necessarily complement each other.
There are multiple ways of reaching the same destination, i.e., there is no single
solution to be adopted. Here, we provide a short overview of selected IoT standards
that play an important role within the context of DE. The SWE suite of standards is
described in more detail in Chap. 8 of this book.
From the geospatial perspective, the OGC coordinates different standardization
initiatives. This consortium is comprised of more than 525-member organizations
from governmental, commercial, non-governmental, academic and research institu-
tions. The primary objective of the OGC is to develop open standards that include
a geospatial component. These standards are developed through a consensus-based
process and are openly available to streamline the exchange of geospatial data. OGC
standards are used in a wide variety of domains, including geosciences and the envi-
ronment, defense and intelligence, emergency and disaster management, and public
services, among others.
Over a decade ago, well before the IoT became mainstream, the OGC developed
the SWE suite of standards for spatio-temporal observation data (Botts et al. 2008).
SWE outlines a set of speciﬁcations related to sensors and proposes data models and
Web service interfaces that can act as a bridge between sensors and users, allowing
the sensors and their measurements to be accessible and controllable through the Web
(Sheth 2018). The SWE suite, although initially designed for sensors, can easily be
applied to any type of spatio-temporal data ﬂow (including heterogeneous types of
396
C. Granell et al.
smart devices with an observation capability). It offers a set of speciﬁcations in an
open standard schema using extensible markup language (XML) and web services.
It enables (i) ﬁnding sensors and sensor data; (ii) describing sensor systems and data;
(iii) recovering real-time and historical sensor observations; (iv) adding simulations
and recovering simulation results; (v) reporting results and alerts; and (vi) full web
control.
SWE (depicted in Fig. 11.4) is organized through several interdependent stan-
dards that include the Sensor Model Language (SensorML) (Botts and Robin 2007),
Observations and Measurements (O&M) (Cox 2003), Sensor Observation Service
(SOS), Transducer Markup Language (TransducerML, deprecated) (Havens 2007),
Sensor Planning Service (SPS) (Simonis 2007), Sensor Alert Service (SAS) (Simo-
nis 2006) and Sensor Event Service (SES) (Echterhoff and Everding 2008). In this
work, only the ﬁrst three speciﬁcations are shown in detail (i.e. SensorML, O&M,
SOS), as they are the most widely used in the IoT context today.
SensorML provides the ability to deﬁne a sensor in a structured manner. The
standard speciﬁes how to ﬁnd, process and record sensor observations so that a data
model and XML schema can be established to control sensors through the Web.
SensorML deﬁnes a standard schema describing any type of sensor, stationary or
dynamic, in situ or remote, active or passive. The PUCK protocol (O’Reilly 2010) is
an addition to the SensorML standard that provides a low-level protocol to retrieve
sensor drivers, and metadata documents, encoded according to SensorML.
The O&M standard, initially developed by the OGC, is also adopted as an Inter-
national Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard (ISO 2011). It provides a
model for representing and exchanging sensor observations. The standard is encoded

11
Internet of Things
397
using an XML/JSON data model, which describes the relationship between different
aspects of the data capture process. The O&M schema deﬁnes both observations and
phenomena. In addition, it can be extended to better support metadata.
Finally, the SOS provides an interoperable means for serving observations via
a Web interface and is the primary service model of the SWE suite. The current
version of the standard introduces a modular structure. The base module provides
three mandatory operations. The ﬁrst, “GetCapabilities”, offers a spatial and temporal
description of the observations that have been stored, as well as a list of the sensors
and their available features. The “DescribeSensor” operation is used to return a sensor
description using SensorML. The “GetObservation” operation provides access to the
actual spatio-temporal data encoded in accordance with the O&M standard.
All the standards described above were conceptualized and adopted several years
ago within a completely different technological landscape. The rapid growth of the
IoT and the emergence of new technologies (e.g. remote sensing, 4G/5G communi-
cation, machine-to-machine and machine-to-human interactions) brought new chal-
lenges such as (i) the need for lightweight data encoding, (ii) the need for higher
bandwidth for data exchange, and (iii) the issue of constrained devices with little or
no computational capabilities, such as RFID tags and QR codes (Kotsev et al. 2018).
These challenges acted as a driver for the OGC and led to adoption of new standards
that better ﬁt the IoT.
The SensorThings API (Liang et al. 2016), designed to follow the paradigm of the
Web of Things (WoT) (Guinard et al. 2010), offers access to data through standard
web protocols and is based on the O&M conceptual data model. The main features
of the standard are (i) a RESTful interface, (ii) the use of lightweight and efﬁcient
JSON encoding, (iii) adoption of the OASIS OData URL pattern (OData) and query
options, and (iv) support for the ISO message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT)
messaging protocol to offer real-time connections.
The SensorThings API data model (shown in Fig. 11.5) is divided into two parts
(proﬁles), namely, the ‘Sensing’ proﬁle and the ‘Tasking’ proﬁle. The former enables
IoT devices and applications to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE (through
the standard web operations HTTP POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE) IoT data and
metadata by invoking a SensorThings API service. In addition, the tasking proﬁle
provides a standardized approach for controlling IoT devices through the “ACT”
capability, which is revisited in the next section. Each ‘Thing’ has a Location (or
some Historical Locations) in space and time. A collection of Observations grouped
by the same Observed Property and Sensor is called a Datastream. An Observation
is an event performed by a Sensor that produces a value of an Observed Property of
the Feature of Interest.
From a spatial analysis perspective (De Smith et al. 2018), many raster- and
vector-based operators and techniques have been developed over the last decades and
have been shown to be successful in many varied applications. Substantial progress
has been made to bring geospatial workﬂows—i.e., a combination of the above
spatial operations to accomplish a sophisticated analytical process—to the cloud and
distributed computing environments (e.g., Granell et al. 2010; Granell 2014; Yue
et al. 2016), expanding the ﬁeld of the Geoprocessing Web (Zhao et al. 2012) to the

Digital Earth (Hofer et al. 2018). The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) (OGC
2005), a service interface for exposing and executing processes of any granularity on
the Web, enables sharing and integration of spatial data processing capabilities on the
Web, including polygon area calculation, routing services, or entire environmental
models (e.g., Díaz et al. 2008; Granell et al. 2010). The geoprocessing capabilities
in DE are extensively covered in other chapters, e.g., Chap. 5, and our interest lies
solely in the relationship between the WPS and the IoT (see Sect. 11.3.2).
11.3
Interplay Between the IoT and DE
One of the aims of this chapter is the identiﬁcation of potential bridges between the
IoT and DE. This overview is partly speculative since we tried to identify potential
paths for collaboration between both infrastructures, which may or may not lead to
successful linkages in the future. To support our claims in Sect. 11.4, we identify the
current situation, i.e., the state of the art of the IoT’s and DE’s technological substrate.
In this section, we highlight new technological developments and emerging trends
11
Internet of Things
399
that are or may become crucial in the coming years that were not present or not
sufﬁciently developed at the time of Van der Zee and Scholten (2014).
Along the lines of the topics described in Sect. 11.2.3, the traditional focus of
DE embraces the following high-level functions (Lü et al. 2019): (i) discovery and
acquisition of spatial information, (ii) understanding of spatial objects and their
relationships (e.g., GIS analysis, spatial statistics), and (iii) determination of the
spatio-temporal behavior and simulation rules (e.g., simulations, predictions). These
functions help categorize and restrict the discussion in terms of the current techno-
logical substrate. However, we should interpret and contextualize these high-level
functions of DE from the viewpoint of the IoT.
First, the acquisition of spatial information is a crucial function in the IoT because
Things and smart devices observe and sense their environment to collect observa-
tional measurements. Through the lens of the IoT, the discoverability of Things
and the communication of gathered spatial data become extremely relevant for data
acquisition. Of the two main capabilities of Things (see Sect. 11.2.2), the ability to
observe and sense, is a fundamental mechanism to provide input observational data
for DE.
Second, spatial statistics and spatial analysis are well-established geospatial meth-
ods for exploring spatial patterns, relationships and distributions (De Smith et al.
2018; Worboys and Duckham 2004). Analytical methods are fundamental build-
ing blocks in DE, although recent trends in real-time analysis and edge computing
promise to move much of the analytical power to devices (i.e., edge and fog com-
puting) so that gathered data can be immediately processed directly on the smart
devices. This trend suggests that analytical improvements in the IoT will also play
an important role in DE.
Third, predictive modeling and simulations are required to explore both physi-
cal and social dynamic geographic phenomena to better understand the evolution,
changes and dynamics of the phenomena from a spatio-temporal perspective, to gain
new insights and scientiﬁc knowledge to support informed decision-making pro-
cesses. Understanding spatiotemporal behaviors makes sense from the DE point of
view, to aid in the assembly of a detailed yet broad perspective of the complex, mul-
tidimensional relationships that occur in the real world. We recognize that prediction
and simulation activities are typically associated with DE and that advances in the
IoT might contribute to this area, but we see this hypothetical scenario occurring
in the mid- to long-term, well beyond the time frame of the speculative exercise in
Sect. 11.4. Since research on the IoT and DE with respect to predictive modeling
and simulations is still in its infancy, we do not cover it in this chapter.
As a result of the previous functions, new scientiﬁc knowledge is generated that
is necessary for taking informed and insightful actions, often ‘acting’ over the envi-
ronment. In terms of acting, the second main capability of Things, new knowledge
can trigger actions at least at two different levels in the context of the IoT: ﬁrst,
self-calibration of a sensor and/or Thing, similar to adjusting the lens in a human eye
to sharpen the image, e.g., changing the sampling frequency; and second, providing
a reﬂex similar to a reaction to pain without thinking, e.g., by opening a valve or
level in the case of imminent ﬂooding. However, this view would mean a priori that
400
C. Granell et al.
Fig. 11.6 IoT and DE
workﬂow according to the
higher cognitive functions in
DE
the acting in IoT and Things do not contribute sufﬁciently to the higher (cognitive)
functions of DE such as spatial analysis, predictive modeling and simulation, but the
results of higher cognitive functions in DE may impact the acting behavior of Things
and the IoT. In addition, we add a fourth function related to the ability of Things to
act and take informed actions, depending on the insights and knowledge produced
in the analysis, simulations, and predictions in DE.
Figure 11.6 reﬂects the existing and potential roles of each infrastructure in rela-
tion to the four functions: (i) discoverability, acquisition, and communication of
spatial information, (ii) understanding of spatial objects and their relationships, (iii)
determining spatio-temporal behavior and simulation rules, and (iv) acting and tak-
ing informed actions. We argue that the IoT infrastructure is important in (i) and
(iv) whereas DE is more relevant in (ii) and (iii). For (i), the IoT can enhance DE
by acquiring data streams from new sources, at a ﬁne scale and high frequency. For
(ii), it is plausible that both infrastructures progressively collaborate in a symbiotic
manner per use case. From a broader perspective, it can reasonably be argued that DE
includes IoT and encompasses the IoT life cycle in a broader ecosystem. Although
GIS methods and analysis have traditionally taken a predominant role in DE, the role
of the IoT will most likely increase in the future given the close relation between the
IoT and the nascent edge-fog-cloud computational paradigms that enable IoT-based
analytical processes to be conducted at different scales. This is a partial view, as
we focus on the relationship between DE and the IoT. For example, remote-sensing
satellite imagery, LIDAR and UAV were intentionally omitted even though they are
key spatial data sources (i.e., the ﬁrst function) for DE. We acknowledge the fuzzi-
ness of the boundary between both infrastructures and pay special attention to the
interplay between DE and the IoT in Fig. 11.6, demonstrating how collaboration
11
Internet of Things
401
and integration is starting to happen while frictions and barriers are becoming more
visible.
In the following sections, we identify for all but the third function the current
technological substrate.
11.3.1
Discoverability, Acquisition and Communication
of Spatial Information
Discoverability of Things. An important objective in IoT research is the discovery
of devices and their services and/or the data they produce. The absence of standard-
ized discovery methods for the WoT (Zhou et al. 2016) led to the development of
online global sensor directories and collections such as Xively (https://xively.com),
SenseWeb (Grosky et al. 2007), SemSOS (Pschorr et al. 2010) and the SWE discov-
ery framework (Jirka et al. 2009). A key feature of these online directories/registries
is that they provide open Web APIs supporting the development of third-party appli-
cations. The main drawback is that they are centralized, with a single point of failure.
Decentralized approaches have also been proposed, such as IrisNet (Gibbons et al.
2003), which uses a hierarchical architecture for a worldwide sensor Web. G-Sense
(Perez et al. 2010) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) system for global sensing and monitor-
ing. These approaches, although more robust and scalable, do not effectively solve
the problem of sensor discovery as they still require sensor registration to dedicated
gateways and servers, which need to maintain a hierarchical or P2P structure among
them.
Approaches towards real-time discovery of physical entities include Snoogle
(Wang et al. 2008) and Dyser (Elahi et al. 2009). Snoogle is an information retrieval
system for WSNs, but it cannot scale for the World Wide Web. Dyser requires an addi-
tional Internet infrastructure such as sensor gateways to work. Moreover, utilization
of the domain name system (DNS) as a scalable, pervasive, global metadata reposi-
tory for embedded devices and its extension for supporting location-based discovery
of Web-enabled physical entities were proposed (Kamilaris et al. 2014; Kamilaris
and Pitsillides 2012). However, this technique requires changes in the existing Inter-
net infrastructure. It is possible to exploit web crawling for discovery of linked data
endpoints, and through them the discovery of WoT devices and services was exam-
ined in WOTS2E (Kamilaris et al. 2016) as well as in SPITFIRE (Pﬁsterer et al.
2011).
While the approaches described above are mainly targeted at ‘professional’ users,
there is demand for a simple and easy means for the general public to access IoT
data. Experts can use a plethora of different service interfaces and tools to discover
and utilize data from IoT devices, as implemented by the SmartEmissions platform
(Grothe et al. 2016). Nonexpert users typically only search for IoT devices and
their data through mainstream search engines such as Google and Bing. Ensuring
the discoverability of devices and the data they produce is being investigated for
402
C. Granell et al.
geospatial data in general (see Portele et al. 2016 for further details). A similar
approach might be adopted for the IoT, considering its higher complexity due to the
high temporal (and spatial) resolution of the data produced by Things.
Spatial acquisition with Things. Some examples of geospatial standards to
encode sensor metadata and observations were introduced in Sect. 11.2.4, and the
SensorML standard is one of the most important. SensorML describes sensor meta-
data in a comprehensive way, providing a useful mechanism to discover sensors and
associated observations. This standard speciﬁes information about a sensor such as
its sensor operator, tasking services, location, phenomena, and history of the sensor.
Thus, it can be used by discovery services to ﬁll their search indexes.
Following the SWE framework, there are two different search types (Jirka et al.
2009): sensor instance discovery and sensor service discovery. The ﬁrst type ﬁnds
individual sensors (devices) or sensor networks, and the second type refers to services
that interact with the sensor (through sensing or tasking). Jirka et al. (2009) deﬁne
three different criteria to identify both annotated search types:
• The Thematic criterion covers the kind of phenomena that a sensor observes, such
as temperature, humidity, or rainfall.
• The Spatial criterion refers to the location where the sensor is deployed.
• The Temporal criterion is the time period during which the observations are gen-
erated.
This classiﬁcation was deﬁned from a conventional sensor point of view. The
inclusion of current IoT devices with the ability to act leaves the previous criteria
incomplete, as some IoT devices act as well as observe. Therefore, the deﬁnition of
the thematic criterion requires extension to include an IoT device’s capability to act,
for example, to turn on/off a light or activate/deactivate an air conditioner.
In addition to the three shared criteria, Jirka et al. (2009) deﬁned two criteria
that focused exclusively on the sensor instance discovery type of search: sensor
properties and sensor identiﬁcation. The sensor properties are based on a speciﬁc
state of the sensor, for example to ﬁnd all online sensors. The sensor identiﬁcation
refers to the unique id used to identify unambiguously a sensor. Regarding the sensor
service discovery type of search, two additional criteria were deﬁned: functionality
and usage restrictions. The ﬁrst refers to the functionalities of the associate service
such as available operations for data access, alerting or tasking, among others. The
second criterion on usage restrictions is related to the permissions and restrictions to
access the service functionalities.
Two different aspects are vital for the successful discovery of a sensor: metadata
and semantics. As for all spatial data, metadata is essential to describe and discover
a sensor or a network of sensors. SensorML was created for this purpose and can
deﬁne a sensor in a well-known manner to add ﬂexibility and allow for the use of any
type of sensor. The Sensor Instance Registry (SIR) deﬁnes operations for handling
sensor metadata and allows for sensor discovery. The above criteria, both common
and speciﬁc for each type of search, are closely related to the metadata aspect for the
discovery of sensor instances and services.
11
Internet of Things
403
Semantics is the other pillar in a powerful and effective discovery service. Seman-
tic rules can aid in locating sensors related to the same phenomena or discovery of
all sensors that are related to the same thematic aspect. This semantic view can be
extrapolated to link sensors with places to retrieve sensors or observations associated
with place names. The Sensor Observable Registry (SOR) offers a primary interface
to explore this kind of relationship between phenomena and sensors.
Unfortunately, the support of semantics is a weakness in the SWE standards. To
solve this issue, an initiative from World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was created
to integrate and align sensors with semantic web technologies and Linked Data. This
contribution was led by the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group (SSN-
XG) that proposed an ontology called Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) to address
the semantic gap in sensor-related OGC standards (Compton et al. 2012). The main
ﬁelds of this ontology are sensors (e.g., location, type), properties (e.g., precision,
resolution, and unit), and measurements (values).
Despite the great advances that SSN brought, it does not currently support all
the possibilities that the IoT offers since SSN was designed before the mainstream
adoption of the IoT. New ontologies have been launched to cover this gap. One
example is how the Internet of Things Ontology (IoT-O). IoT-O adds some missing
concepts relevant to the IoT such as Thing, Actuator, and Actuation (Seydoux et al.
2016). Similarity, the Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology
is a follow-up to SSN. It is the result of a joint effort of the W3C and OGC that builds
on the lessons learned from SSN to provide a better representation of the IoT and
alignment with OGC-related speciﬁcations (Janowicz et al. 2018).
Communication with Things. The advances in IoT connectivity solutions such
as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi and 3-5G (Palatella et al. 2016) combined with decreases
in the price and energy consumption of IoT components have led to a huge deploy-
ment of smart devices using IP-connectivity worldwide, increasing the frequency of
communication to the point that they are perceived as always connected. As outlined
above, these devices can offer two different capabilities, observing (sensing) and act-
ing. A decade ago, sensor networks were only able to capture and send data, similar to
a simple data logger. In recent years, the ability to establish two-way communication
between Things and the cloud has added the feature that Things can (re)act. Con-
sequently, new protocols that enable machine-to-machine (M2 M) communication
have been developed, with the goal of providing efﬁcient and transparent two-way
communication channels between smart devices. Examples of such TCP/IP-based
protocols are the advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP), MQTT, and the
simple/streaming text oriented messaging protocol (STOMP). These communica-
tion protocols are adapted to the requirements of IoT devices that are constrained
concerning their performance and energy efﬁciency.

11.3.2
Spatial Understanding of Objects and Their
Relationships
Spatial analysis of Things. There are many more smart devices (Things) around
today than ﬁve years ago. Smart devices now produce massive volumes of data, i.e.,
ﬂows of data with strong temporal and spatial features. Therefore, spatial analytical
methods such as proximity, area, volume, and trajectory are of vital importance in
analyzing processes of Things. However, the variety of data sources related to the
IoT has posed new analytical challenges, especially in the design and provision of a
new class of analytical tools capable of handling real-time temporally and spatially
referenced data from a plethora of heterogeneous smart devices (Trilles et al. 2017).
Despite the existence of tools capable of analyzing temporal data in real time, the
same does not appear to be true for the spatial component. Space (location and
orientation for all Things, size and shape for larger Things such as cars) plays an
indispensable role in the IoT, as Things-generated data have spatial properties and
are spatially related to each other. Promising initiatives and platforms have recently
emerged with the aim of performing spatio-temporal analysis in real-time, such
as Microsoft Streaminsight, the Oracle Spatial Database with the Oracle Complex
Event Processing engine, and the GeoEvent processor module as an extension of the
ArcGIS Server environment (ArcGIS Server, n.d.).
Despite these notable efforts, spatial support for the real-time analysis of IoT data
is still in its infancy. As Van der Zee and Scholten (2014) noted, any IoT architecture
should consider the geospatial component. Location provides a kind of ‘glue’ that
efﬁciently connects smart devices. The authors proposed storing the location of each
‘Thing’ and other geographic-related features such as orientation, size, and shape.
However, the ability to handle and analyze the location of Things in near real time is
still limited with existing analytical platforms, despite its opportunities (McCullough
et al. 2011; Rodríguez-Pupo et al. 2017).
Furthermore, spatio-temporally located Things have the potential to signiﬁcantly
improve advanced geospatial analysis, as Kamilaris and Ostermann (2018) describe
in their review on the potential role of geospatial analysis in the IoT ﬁeld. In short,
Kamilaris and Ostermann suggest network analysis and monitoring, surface interpo-
lation, and data mining and clustering as spatial analysis techniques and methods that
would especially beneﬁt from an increasing number of mobile or stationary sensor
Things. However, as the authors noted, these advanced analytical applications have
been scarcely exploited to date.
Geospatial standards for Things. Despite some remarkable exceptions such
as prototype systems to analyze data from air quality sensor networks (Trilles et al.
2015b), real-time, geospatial analysis approaches and tools have not been sufﬁciently
developed to offer standardized procedures through uniform interfaces that can be
widely consumed and integrated in DE applications. DE has traditionally considered
sensors as a fundamental pillar to collect information to support and realize strategies
or policies at a higher level. As described in Sect. 11.2, the SWE suite was the
initial step in offering a standardized speciﬁcation that would fulﬁl the requirements
11
Internet of Things
405
demanded by the IoT from the DE perspective. For example, the SOS speciﬁcation
requires handling large XML documents, which is problematic in a typical scenario
in the IoT where memory capacity and connectivity are limiting factors.
Although the core of the SWE suite has served to cover the required functionality
of the IoT, the complexity of the data models in some of the speciﬁcations (Tamayo
et al. 2011; Trilles et al. 2014) and the appearance of new requirements such as the
ability to work in real time and to act have reduced the applicability and integration
of the SWE suite in the scope of the IoT. In an effort to bridge the gaps between SOS
and the IoT, new extensions or approaches attempt to make the SOS interfaces more
suitable for IoT devices. These approaches include SOSLite (Pradilla et al. 2015),
TinySOS (Jazayeri et al. 2012) and SOS over CoAP (Pradilla et al. 2016).
Another crucial feature for the analysis functionality of the IoT and Things is the
ability to specify and perform real-time and asynchronous notiﬁcations and com-
munications. In this regard, the GeoMQTT protocol based on the MQTT protocol
allows for adding spatial notiﬁcation and data streaming between publish/subscribe
instances (Herle and Blankenbach 2018). Following the original approach of the
MQTT channels, the authors proposed the concept of GeoPipes to distribute instances
and enable the sharing of geospatial data streams in a standardized manner.
Laska et al. (2018) proposed a real-time stream processing pipeline that allows
for spatiotemporal data stream integration from IoT devices. A data integration layer
allows for geospatial subscriptions using the GeoMQTT. Tools such as Apache Kafka
and Storm are used to transfer and apply map matching algorithms to IoT data with
spatiotemporal components. For example, these algorithms were used to analyze
trafﬁc congestion for a recent route optimization using IoT Things with Global Nav-
igation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in buses.
Another study (Rieke et al. 2018) took an additional step to bridge the DE and
IoT realms by arguing for the need to establish event-driven architectures as a nat-
ural evolution of the predominantly static Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). The
authors identify a series of interdependent issues that need to be addressed in the
coming years to take full advantage of the uptake of eventing in GIScience (and
DE). The issues relate to the (i) inconsistencies between classic data access methods
that are based on a request-response pattern, and event-driven approaches where a
publish-subscribe pattern prevails, (ii) heterogeneous approaches for deﬁning event
patterns, (iii) multiple standards and limited support in software tools, (iv) the inte-
gration of devices in an SDI and the data they produce, and (v) the lack of semantic
interoperability of geospatial events.

11.3.3
Taking Informed Actions and Acting Over
the Environment (ACT)
As shown in the deﬁned IoT lifecycle (Fig. 11.6), to act means to take or perform
actions (over the environment) depending on the results obtained in previous func-
tions. Bélissent (2010) noted that this feature can make the management of public
services in a city, education, health, safety, mobility or disaster management more
aware, interactive and efﬁcient.
IoT devices have been traditionally suitable for use as input sources for Decision
Support Systems (DSSs) in a multitude of application domains and use case scenarios
such as disaster management, cities, mobility, and safety. In this chapter, we focus on
Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs), which are deﬁned as interactive systems
designed to support decision making related with spatial planning problems. SDSSs
have evolved to more complex architectures and communication models, from sys-
tems deployed on the cloud operating with data from the WSN (or IoT data sources)
to a shift in the computing paradigm in which the actual computation is implemented
at three different levels: edge, fog, and cloud (Fig. 11.7). In this new setting, both the
computation and decisions are made closer to the producers of the data (Things).
The ‘Edge’ is the layer that covers the smart devices and their users, providing
local computing capacity within Things. The ‘Fog’ layer is hierarchical, aggregating
a variable number of edge layers. In addition to computing, the fog layer has other
functionalities such as networking, storage, control, and data processing, possibly
using data produced by the edge layer and data from other sources. As a result, data
contextualization is more important in the fog layer to make sense of different data
sources than the typical single data stream in an edge layer. The ‘Cloud’ layer on
top performs the ﬁnal analysis to extract information and create knowledge to be

11
Internet of Things
407
transferred for decision support actions. This implies an increased level of contextu-
alization and complexity in the analysis process than in the previous (lower) layers,
at the cost of losing capacity for real-time analysis.
Given the edge-fog-cloud layered architecture, the introduction of geospatial con-
cepts and spatial analysis in the fog layer could allow for decision-making processes
without a human in the loop based entirely on the semantics of the spatial-temporal
dimensions in the incoming data. In recent years, many efforts have been made to
move the analysis from the cloud to the fog layer, with the aim of reducing latency
in the analysis once the data are received in the fog layer (Barik et al. 2016).
Although data usually ﬂow from the edge to the cloud layer (sensing capability),
devices with the ability to act (tasking) also require information to perform their
operations. The tasking capability allows for other devices or users to actuate devices
via the Internet so that these ‘controlling’ devices or users can easily control them
to execute tasks remotely. Autonomous Things would be previously programmed
to act without establishing a connection. While the sensing capability allows for
users to continuously monitor the status of devices and the environmental properties
they capture, the tasking capability can help users make adjustments accordingly by
controlling devices remotely.
In general, combining the sensing and tasking capabilities of IoT devices enables
users to create various automatic and efﬁcient tasks and applications. These kinds
of applications are called “physical mashup” applications (Guinard et al. 2010). A
simple, domestic example is the activation of an air conditioning system depending
on the position and behavior of the user, through an application that uses a GNSS
sensor. In this example, the air conditioning device provides an interface to turn on/off
(tasking) the system to establish a comfortable temperature. To facilitate this kind of
mashup of sensing and tasking capabilities, a uniform (interoperable) interface for
users or applications to enable access and communication is a critical requirement.
The tasking feature was initially conceived in the SPS speciﬁcation of the SWE
suite. SPS offers a standardized interface for tasking sensors and sensor systems and
deﬁnes interfaces to expose sensor observations and metadata. For example, a sensor
network can be set up to measure air pollution in 5-min intervals or a satellite can be
tasked to remotely sense a speciﬁc region on the surface of the globe (De Longueville
et al. 2010). This standard offers operations such as GetFeasibility, which can be used
in advance to verify whether the execution of a task is feasible for a certain sensor, and
the DescribeResultAccess operation to determine the access points to collected data.
The SPS interface also offers functionality for managing submitted tasks, including
convenient operations for retrieving the status of a task, updating tasks or cancelling
them.
A next step is the tasking proﬁle of the SensorThing API, which is a follow-up,
improved proﬁle of the SPS (Simonis 2007). The SensorThing API (see Sect. 11.2)
deﬁnes two different proﬁles, Sensing and Tasking. The Tasking proﬁle is based on
the SPS standard and enables interoperable submission of tasks to control sensors
and actuators. The main difference between SPS and the SensorThings API is that
the former offers task operations over sensors and the latter also includes tasks
on actuators. Although the ﬁrst version of the SensorThing API did not include the

opengeospatial.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html)
Tasking proﬁle, a new candidate standard illustrates the potential of the SPS standard,
duly adopted and aligned with the requirements of the SensorThings speciﬁcation
(Liang and Khalafbeigi 2018). This new speciﬁcation called Tasking Core deﬁnes
three new entities, TaskCapability, Task, and Actuator (Fig. 11.8).
The TaskingCapability entity describes all supported tasks for each Thing and
how they can be used. This entity is deﬁned by four properties: name, description,
taskingParameters, and properties. The second entity, Task, is a list of performed tasks
that are deﬁned by a set of tasking parameters (commands executed) and creation
time. The last entity is the Actuator and deﬁnes a type of transducer that converts
a signal to a real-world action or phenomenon. This entity is comprises a name,
description, encoding type of metadata and metadata.

Case Studies on Smart Scenarios
In this section, we show how the IoT and DE work hand-in-hand in real-world scenar-
ios based on the latest technology initiatives to relate the IoT and DE described in the
previous section. Kamilaris and Ostermann (2018) provide an extensive overview of
work at the nexus of geospatial analysis and the Internet of Things; here, we provide
a selection of case studies in various domain applications, with a special focus on
the relationship between DE and the IoT.
In the context of applications for environmental monitoring and resource man-
agement in cities, recent examples of IoT applications include an Arduino-based
sensor platform in Seoul to measure variations in the physical-chemical parameters
in water streams (Jo and Baloch 2017). The sensor platform is powered by solar
energy and transmitted sensor readings every second via Bluetooth for three years.
Although the case study in Jo and Baloch (2017) relies on a single sensor station and
11
Internet of Things
409
the clustering analysis of the raw data focuses uniquely on the temporal dimension,
the paper shows the potential of Arduino-based sensing modules for environmental
sensing applications in smart city applications. To improve solid waste management,
Tao and Xiang (2010) developed an information platform to support recycling. The
main technologies were RFID and GPS to track and check waste ﬂows between
collection, transport, and processing facilities. Lee et al. (2015) examined the role
of the IoT in an industrial service provision scenario (ﬂeet management) and Fazio
and Puliaﬁto (2015) use the example of road conditions to showcase a cloud-based
architecture for sensor and data discovery. They distinguish two scenarios of data- or
device-driven search, and develop the system architecture based on the OGC SWE
suite and the extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP).
Reducing the required energy consumption remains an important objective for
IoT devices. Ayele et al. (2018) proposed a dual radio approach for wildlife moni-
toring systems. They combine Bluetooth low energy for intraherd monitoring with
LoRa for low-power wide-area networks to communicate between herd clusters and
a monitoring server. The proposed architecture promises signiﬁcant advantages in
reducing power consumption while maintaining low latency.
Improving trafﬁc management is another promising IoT application area. In 2006,
Lee et al. proposed the use of cars as a mobile vehicular sensor network and for data
exchange in “smart mobs”. More recently envisioned solutions include parking man-
agement and smart trafﬁc lights as part of a cognitive road management system that
handlesdifferenttypesoftrafﬁcefﬁciently(MizandHahanov2014).Jingetal.(2018)
examined the combination of GNSS localization and RFID tagging for infrastructure
asset management with promising results. Additionally, the city of Aarhus in Den-
mark deployed trafﬁc sensors across major roads in the city, and the information was
used by the CityPulse project to provide context-aware recommendations to users
for route planning (Puiu et al. 2016).
Noise pollution is a frequent problem in dense urban areas, and because urban
morphology makes noise distribution modeling difﬁcult, it has attracted participatory
sensing approaches. Wireless acoustic sensor networks are another option. Segura
Garcia et al. (2016) presented a case study in the small city of Algemesi (Spain),
where a network of 78 inexpensive sensor nodes based on Raspberry PIs collected
sufﬁcient data for a subsequent highly accurate spatial interpolation.
Okasenen et al. (2015) harnessed movement data from mobile sports tracking
applications in urban areas to produce heat maps of cyclists commuting through the
city of Helsinki. Mobile phones could be considered IoT sensor devices in partic-
ipatory sensing-based models for mining spatial information of urban emergency
events, as demonstrated by Xu et al. (2016). In addition, van Setten et al. (2004)
supported the COMPASS tourist mobile application with context-aware recommen-
dations and route planning. Mobile phones were also used for crowdsourcing-based
disaster relief during the Haitian earthquake (Zook et al. 2010), where people used the
camera and GPS of their phones to send information from the ﬁeld to the authorities
to map the landscape of the disaster and assess the overall damage.

C. Granell et al.
University campuses present an interesting environment for smart city approaches
because the visitors are usually more tech-savvy than the average population, the net-
work coverage is good, and the geographic boundaries allow for a comparatively crisp
delineation of the study area. Cecchinel et al. (2014) presented a system architecture
for a smart campus case where the four requirements of sensor heterogeneity, recon-
ﬁguration capability, scalability, and data as a service were handled via a middleware
in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, with Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi sen-
sors for bridging. Another case study at a university campus examined the impact of
nearby weather and pollution sensors on the everyday decision-making of the stu-
dents (Kamilaris and Pitsillides 2014). Trilles et al. (2015a) presented a sensorized
platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the IoT and the WoT. They use
the SensorThings API to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN in a
Smart Campus scenario was developed as a proof of concept.
However, smart approaches with IoT technology are not limited to smart city
applications. Sawant et al. (2014) presented a low-cost automated weather station
system for agriculture that uses Raspberry Pi systems at its core and SWE to trans-
mit data. The sensor readings were also broadcast on a dedicated Twitter account.
The system has been extended with additional components such as a web-based
client (Sawant et al. 2017). The environmental impact of agriculture was studied
by Kamilaris et al. (2018) in the region of Catalonia, Spain. In their study, sensors
measuring nitrates and data from the mobile phones of farmers in the region were
used. Fang et al. (2014) presented a holistic approach to environmental monitoring
and management through an integrated information system that collects data on the
regional climate for the city of Xinjiang from various sources including IoT sensors,
and related it with ecological response variables such as the primary production and
leaf area index. For environmental monitoring, the AirSensEUR project established
an affordable open software/hardware multisensor platform, which can monitor air
pollution at low concentration levels to create maps of pollution levels in different
areas (Kotsev et al. 2016).
A crucial component of any DE system and application is monitoring shifting
surface conditions such as erosion on sandy beaches. Pozzebon et al. (2018) presented
an Arduino-based system to measure the height of sandy beaches and dunes in real-
time. The sensor network uses the ZigBee standard to transmit data, with a GPRS
transmitter for sending sensor readings to a MySQL database. Another example
is the monitoring of landslides in mountainous areas. Benoit et al. (2015) tested a
successful cheap wireless sensor network using XBee for communication and GPS
for localization. A thematically related case study is the use of small and inexpensive
sensors for monitoring and early-warning systems for ﬂoods caused by melting snow
in the Quergou River basin (China), as reported by Fang et al. (2015). In addition,
changing climate conditions make reliable and efﬁcient management of storm water
surges in urban areas important. Rettig et al. (2016) designed and tested a geospatial
sensor network for this task, built using common, off-the-shelf components.
With respect to the provision and reception of cultural heritage and cultural ser-
vices, Chianese et al. (2017) proposed and tested a system that combines business
11
Internet of Things
411
intelligence, Big Data, and IoT data collection to analyze visitor interests and behav-
iors in a museum. Although IoT devices were only part of the approach, measuring
visitor proximity to artworks, their integrated use with other technologies and plat-
forms showcases the strength of a multisensory DE approach.
11.5
Frictions and Synergies Between the IoT and DE
Based on the current technological substrate that provides the initial steps to estab-
lish connections between the IoT and DE according to the three cognitive functions
(Sect. 11.3), and the presentation of selected case studies (Sect. 11.4), in this section,
we (i) carry out a speculative exercise to discuss the main existing limitations and
frictions that prevent the IoT and DE from working closer together and (ii) suggest
future ways to establish effective communication channels between the two infras-
tructures.
Before going into detail, it is necessary to establish a fundamental assumption that
inﬂuences any discussion related to the frictions and synergies between the IoT and
DE: the diverging speeds of development of DE and the IoT. New technology and dis-
ruptive breakthroughs generally challenge the status quo in any sector, and adopting
such improvements can enable more rapid developments and new applications. How-
ever, the rapid growth of the IoT ﬁeld has produced a vast variety of IoT devices and
protocols and, consequently, the landscape of IoT-related standards, protocols and
speciﬁcations is fragmented. For example, a large portion of ‘Things’ were not origi-
nally designed to connect to the Internet; they were later adapted to establish Internet
connections by adding connectivity chips via microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Rasp-
berry Pi) or through tags (QR Code or RFID). As a result, many different ways to
connect hardware and software to enable Internet connectivity were developed and
established with no clearly agreed upon consensus and consequently resulted in a
lack of interoperability. This example illustrates the great variety and complexity of
the IoT universe, where the exponential growth of the IoT is due to the rapid decrease
in the size, cost, and energy requirements of sensors, and the ubiquity of network
coverage for wireless Internet connections, leading to many standardization efforts
following diverging paths. In addition, DE has been traditionally characterized by a
slow adaptation of new improvements (López 2011), and thus, the recent technolog-
ical developments have not evolved at the same speed in DE as in the IoT. Noting
this fundamental friction, we identify other potential frictions and synergies, which
may be considered two sides of one coin, and organize the discussion according to
the cognitive functions deﬁned in Sect. 11.3.
412
C. Granell et al.
11.5.1
Discoverability, Acquisition and Communication
of Spatial Information
A direct result of the fragmented standardization context noted above is the absence
of well-accepted global protocols for the discovery of Things, which also occurs
to some extent in DE. Search and discovery is crucial for geo-locating nearby, local,
and/or relevant real-world devices and services, a vital step in exploiting sensor data
and services to create more advanced knowledge. Early efforts in this direction are
discussed in Sect. 11.3.1, but we are still far from a complete solution to this difﬁcult
problem, which must be addressed along with the challenges of better description
of devices and services and the semantics of the data involved, especially from a
geospatial point of view.
Therefore, it remains an open issue to build an IoT-DE ecosystem in a way that will
be compatible with standardized IoT reference models and architectures to enable
the discovery of relevant sensors (or Things) and related services. Although there are
many different scenarios and solutions, several common features can be extracted
to ﬁnd synergies between both infrastructures: the modularity and interoperability
of IoT components, open models and architectures, ﬂexible service compositions,
integrated security solutions, and semantic data integration. There is an intensiﬁed
effort regarding the development of architectural frameworks and solutions such as
the IEEE or ITU-T models, as well as other related works and approaches developed
under the auspices of IETF, W3C, or OASIS. From a DE point of view, associated
services for sensor devices and instances are the cornerstone to enable seamless
communication and interoperability between the IoT and DE. There are different
options such as the SWE and SensorThings API, the latter of which is especially
relevant for the establishment of potential solid bridges between the IoT and DE
concerning common data models for better data acquisition and uniﬁed interfaces
for enhanced sensor and service discovery. Some research works have already made
substantial progress. Jara et al. (2014) presented a comprehensive framework and
architecture to enable discovery over a wide range of technologies and protocols,
including legacy systems, and Wang et al. (2015) implemented annotations with an
ontology-based semantic service model, SPARQL queries, and geographic indexing
to enable sensor discovery in an experimental study, which delivered faster and more
accurate responses than other tested approaches.
11.5.2
Spatial Understanding of Objects and Their
Relationships
A friction between DE and the IoT is related to the way geographical features are
modeled. Traditional GIS data models conceptually abstract the real-world objects
into core geometric elements such as points, lines, polygons, and volumes, imple-
mented as raster data models, vector data models, or a combination. These data
11
Internet of Things
413
models were designed to perform spatial analyses such as distance computations
and topological operations. Despite these great achievements, GIS (and DE) data
models were not designed to cope with the richness and complexity of the inter-
actions between the physical, natural, and social actors that naturally occur in the
environment in the way that the IoT potentially can. As noted above, smart devices
and Things can ‘sense’ the environment in a way that was unimaginable before, and,
consequently, the streams of rich and ﬁner data acquired by IoT devices do not
ﬁt well with the “coarse-grained” vector/raster data models widely used in DE
applications and systems, as these spatial structures were not intended to handle data
with such a high spatio-temporal resolution.
The lack of suitable data models to efﬁciently manage data at high spatio-temporal
resolution highlights the need for new tools to process data coming from Things
and smart devices in which the modeling of geospatial features has not yet been
fully resolved. Moreover, real-time data is often a deﬁning feature in the IoT, as
IoT devices and Things can produce data at a high frequency (e.g., data streams),
which requires methods for real-time analysis. Therefore, the lack of new algorithms
and implementations for real-time computation and processing streams of spatially
referenced data sets is a clear limitation. Although some tools can run geospatial
queries of stored data, they do not offer ways to analyze data from IoT devices and
sensor nodes in real-time (Nittel 2015).
Unlike the IoT, any changes in the DE arena have been more gradual and less
frenetic. However, some notable changes indicate the way forward to consolidate
potential bridges between DE and the IoT in the midterm and long term. For exam-
ple, in a Digital Earth Nervous System (De Longueville et al. 2010), Things could
perform basic geospatial operations on sub-networks of Things, providing pro-
cessed information for the higher-level elements of a DE. Geometric measurements
and basic geospatial analysis are application areas in which Things have been used
more widely in recent years (Kamilaris and Ostermann 2018). Similarly, an often
overlooked component of IoT applications are the gateway nodes that connect the
sensor devices to the wider network. In addition to a simple routing function, these
gateways can perform other tasks including exploratory analysis (clustering, event-
detection) of incoming data. Rahmani et al. (2018) examined the use of smart gate-
ways in an e-health system that monitors several individual physiological parameters,
demonstrating the potential beneﬁts of (spatial) analysis executed directly on smart
gateways in the context of DE-related applications such as precision agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and disaster management.
The status quo of services for spatial analysis and geoprocessing on the Web is
mainly driven by the WPS standard speciﬁcation (Sect. 11.2.4). However, Herle and
Blankenbach (2018) argued that the current WPS standard is not well suited to handle
the large amounts of real-time streaming data expected from massive IoT sensor
networks. Building on previous work, they extended the WPS with the GeoPipes
concept using the GeoMQTT protocol for communication, implementing several
smaller proofs-of-concept for application cases such as inverse distance weighting
with a sliding window and trajectory data mining. In addition, Armstrong et al. (2018)
presented an IoT + CyberGIS system to detect radiation risk and propose that new
414
C. Granell et al.
approaches are needed to integrate the IoT and geospatial analysis and support the
fourth scientiﬁc paradigm of data-intensive discovery (Hey et al. 2009).
11.5.3
Taking Informed Actions and Acting Over
the Environment
In the initial stages of DE, it was thought that sensors could only capture what is
happening in the physical environment, i.e., sensors as mere data loggers. The data
collected by these sensors are transferred from bottom to top until reaching the SDI
repositories. In this sense, the IoT is much more complex because, in addition the fea-
ture of acting on the physical environment, the IoT supports communication between
devices in the same layer (edge) and complex strategies to determine solutions to
real, large problems can be developed. As mentioned above, DE should be adapted to
the possibilities that the IoT devices can offer to enrich the capabilities of the current
SDIs.
The previously noted heterogeneity problem of connecting IoT devices implies
different hardware speciﬁcations across the multiple IoT devices. This variety of
hardware means that the abovementioned standards cannot work at a low level. This
is why the standards mainly deﬁne web service interfaces, and connectors or adapters
(hub approach) are required to control IoT nodes. Similar to the hub approach, the
Sensor Interface Descriptor (SID) solution is a declarative model based on the Sensor
ML standard for describing device capabilities (Broering and Below 2010), sensor
metadata, sensor commands, and device protocols. In terms of the tasking capability,
the SID describes device protocols with the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
model using an XML schema and thus understanding and adapting the SID may be
costly for IoT device manufacturers.
An opportunity that DE can offer the IoT is a global vision on the in situ data
that the IoT collects, with the aim of establishing strategies to perform actions in a
coordinated manner among the IoT nodes, taking advantage of the ability to act. To
conclude, the following Table 11.1 summarizes the frictions and synergies between
the IoT and DE.
11.6
Conclusion and Outlook for the Future of the IoT
in Support of DE
The concept of combining sensors organized in networks to monitor the environment
has been around for decades, and DE has contributed to its expansion. The conﬂuence
of new technologies has created a new reality that offers millions of new possibilities,
ledbytheIoTrevolutionthatpromisestocreateanewlyinterconnected“smart”world
(or Earth). After the massive deployment of a ubiquitous array of IoT devices and the

impact it made, the world cannot give up being ‘online’. Today, the IoT has enabled
millions of relationships between objects and Things, so that objects, people, and
their environment are more tightly intertwined than ever. Despite the great advances
achieved in recent years, like all disruptive innovations, the IoT presents a series of
challenges that should be treated as a priority in the coming years, especially in the
areas of security, interoperability and standards, privacy, and legal issues. DE can
also play a crucial role in handling some of these challenges.
TheIoTandDEdichotomypresentsvariouschallengesthatshouldbeaddressedin
the near future to create a more beneﬁcial union for both parties: The ﬁrst challenge
is to activate mechanisms to streamline the adaptation of new IoT functionalities
from DE. Traditionally, DE is characterized by its comparative inertia to adopt new
approaches that imply improvements in terms of performance or usability. Examples
include the slow adoption of more ﬂexible interfaces such as the RESTful web
interface or data formats that are more suitable for exchange such as JSON in sensor
standards such as the SOS speciﬁcation (Tamayo et al. 2011). The tradeoffs between
standardization and disruptive innovation in DE should be carefully discussed by all
involved actors to fuel rapid, innovative developments in DE like those in the IoT
ﬁeld. Although the standardization process is key to establishing permanent links
between the two infrastructures, it should not slow down innovative changes and
technical developments, and standards should be seen as a means to ﬁlter out and
embrace changes that prove to be useful, effective and valuable for improvement of
the IoT-DE ecosystem.
When a technological ﬁeld grows exponentially, it often leads to heterogeneity
and variety in the short term. Within the IoT, this is partly due to the impact that
the continuous development and improvement of hardware technology has on IoT
416
C. Granell et al.
devices. Therefore, another challenge to be addressed is the heterogeneity of IoT
devices. Although the OGC speciﬁcations have helped in the service connection and
data/service access levels, the IoT still presents a wide variety of different hardware
developments and implementations, most of which are disconnected from the DE
infrastructure, and therefore remain invisible for DE applications. The development
of ad hoc adapters is one way, at least until a standards consensus is reached in the
IoT ﬁeld, to allow for interaction with the variety of hardware speciﬁcations of IoT
devices and Things and foster connections between the two infrastructures. This is
not an optimal solution since the integration of IoT devices is a challenging and
difﬁcult task, but it helps discern the connections and adaptors that may eventually
become candidates for standardization bodies.
Throughout this chapter, we revisited many tools that are capable of analyzing
spatially referenced data collected by IoT devices. However, the quantity and quality
of tools that handle the temporal dimension of data in real time far exceeds those
that deal with the spatial dimension. An additional barrier is the large-scale variance
in the data models between IoT devices and the decision-making systems that are
typically established in DE. Optimal spatial models to handle scale variations can
be useful to analyze the information received from IoT devices and obtain a more
high-level vision that can be interpreted by decision makers and policy makers.
Therefore, investment in the research and development of better tools to spatially
analyze IoT data in real time on the edge, fog and cloud scales is a priority in the
IoT-DE ecosystem roadmap.

Abstract The human behaviors and interactions on social media have maintained
themselves as highly dynamic real-time social systems representing individual social
awareness at ﬁne spatial, temporal, and digital resolutions. In this chapter, we intro-
duce the opportunities and challenges that human dynamics-centered social media
bring to Digital Earth. We review the information diffusion of social media, the
multi-faced implications of social media, and some real-world cases. Social media,
on one hand, has facilitated the prediction of human dynamics in a wide spectrum of
aspects, including public health, emergency response, decision making, and social
equity promotion, and will also bring unintended challenges for Digital Earth, such
as rumors and location spooﬁng on the other. Considering the multifaceted impli-
cations, this chapter calls for GIScientists to raise their awareness of the complex
impacts of social media, to model the geographies of social media, and to understand
ourselves as a unique species living both on the Earth and in Digital Earth.

Introduction: Electronic Footprints on Digital Earth
Geo-positioning system-enabled instruments can record and reveal personal aware-
ness at ﬁne spatial, temporal, and digital resolutions (Siła-Nowicka et al. 2016; Li
et al. 2017; Ye and Liu 2019). With an exponential growth, human dynamics data are
retrieved from location-aware devices, leading to a revolutionary research agenda
regarding what happens where and when in the everyday lives of people in both real
and virtual worlds (Batty 2013; Yao et al. 2019). Many location-based social media

(LBSM) instances have been gaining popularity, fostering the emergence of ﬁne-
grained georeferenced social media content through these personalized devices (Liu
et al. 2018a, b). The proliferation of LBSM enables researchers and practitioners to
efﬁciently track a large and growing number of human action and interaction records
over time and space to develop insights and enhance decision-making process from
individual to global levels. The patterns and trends produced by LBSM can iden-
tify the movement of active social media users and aid in inferring demographics
and related infrastructures. The collected data on users’ physical and virtual activ-
ities facilitate the in-depth understanding of human dynamics from various aspects
(Barabasi 2005; Shaw et al. 2016). The large volumes of such user-generated loca-
tional and contextual information are especially beneﬁcial to studies relevant to the
evolution of population size and human settlement structure as well as highly topical
subjects such as trafﬁc and epidemiological forecasting. For instance, real-time cus-
tomer shopping behaviors might be rapidly identiﬁed by searching speciﬁc keywords
in tweets, which allows for urban researchers and business analysts to monitor the
ﬁne-scale dynamics of economic geography and market outcome (Ye and He 2016).
This new data landscape might not directly provide an ultimate solution to long-
standing social or economic issues, but can increasingly shed light on many societal
characteristics that are otherwise difﬁcult to discover using traditional questionnaires
or surveys.
Human actions and interactions in the digital form as well as frequent status
updates can manifest themselves as highly dynamic real-time social systems, which
enable the government to formulate appropriate policies for the relevant groups and
targeted communities (Shi et al. 2018; Wang and Ye 2018). The electronic footprints
and perceptions left by social media users and derivatives of complicated social
networks can be utilized to enhance the design of location-based services (Ye and
Lee 2016). Hence, the increasing demands in mapping and analyzing social media
data call for more innovative conceptual and technological advances in visual and
computational methods. These research challenges and opportunities can facilitate
a paradigm shift in the broader social science disciplines in this new form of data
landscape. Social media messages can depict the interconnected patterns and rela-
tionshipsbetweencyberspaceandphysicalspace,andcanalsobedistributedinstantly
to a large number of users globally, who may belong to different virtual communities
(Shelton et al. 2015).
Geographic information has traditionally been spread by governments or indus-
tries in a top-down manner; but its broadcast is much faster through social media
than ofﬁcial agencies. The dramatic transition towards bottom-up digital dissemina-
tion has challenged these ofﬁcial or professional processes. Individuals can utilize
the power of volunteered geographic information to minimize the difference and/or
quality between experts and nonexperts in the context of generating a large col-
lection of user-described features and numerous georeferenced citizen observations
on socio-economic phenomena. With social media platforms becoming increasingly
location-enabled, users can share geo-tagged information about their own lives and,
as a result, rich content about large populations can be aggregated for social and
behavioral studies (Sui and Goodchild 2011). Such a practice facilitates the policy
12
Social Media and Social Awareness
427
transition from long-term to short-term action with a new perspective of understand-
ing, visualizing, and analyzing human dynamics (Batty 2013).
The use of LBSM content represents a signiﬁcant methodological advancement
in social sciences and humanities research, providing rich content regarding human-
environment interaction with locational estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive comput-
ing. It can efﬁciently assist place-based policy interventions in a timely fashion.
Prompt and rigorous detection of emerging social and economic events calls for
more robust algorithms to support such unprecedented research efforts in both qual-
itative and quantitative analyses. However, challenges and difﬁculties remain in pro-
cessing user-generated messages to derive effective and high-quality information,
considering the complex syntax and context embedded in social media messages.
Additionally, if data analytics cannot be effectively conducted, the expected results
could lose value for decision makers. These issues must be addressed to realize the
potential of social media analytics.
Considering the above-mentioned issues, the remainder of this chapter is orga-
nizedasfollows.Section12.2describesthemultifacetedimplicationsofsocialmedia.
Regarding social media, the unprecedented opportunities to predict human dynam-
ics are introduced in Sect. 12.3, while multiple challenges are listed in Sect. 12.4.
Then, the implications of these opportunities and challenges are further discussed in
Sect. 12.5, followed by a conclusion in Sect. 12.6.
12.2
Multifaceted Implications of Social Media
Value systems are fundamental to anything we do. Today, the rapid proliferation
of social media has greatly affected us and almost every aspect of human society.
Confronted with this complicated and unstoppable interaction, we employ value
structures to holistically discover the implications of social media, especially the
unintended but vital ones. McLuhan’s (1975) law of media is frequently utilized to
capture the social consequences of various media. Tuan (2003) also proposed the
psychology of power to unveil the internal logic of human’s perceptions of places,
and Ihde (1990) contemplated how technology mediates between human beings and
the world from a phenomenological perspective.
Among these value structures, we employ Ihde’s ampliﬁcation-reduction struc-
ture to investigate the opportunities and challenges brought by social media. This
structure reveals how technology (including social media) amplify and simultane-
ously reduce a certain human experience. The ampliﬁed and reduced experiences are
intertwined and interrelated. More signiﬁcantly, the ampliﬁed human experience is
obvious whereas the reduced human experience is undiscoverable and easily ignored.
Though Ihde only suggested applying this structure to the human experience, it can
also be applied to understand the social implications of the investigating object.
Through this structure, the opportunities and challenges of the social implications
can be revealed. For example, during the 2008 Olympic Games, social media was
touted as a tool of freedom to enable the general public to express their concerns
428
X. Ye et al.
about the air pollution issues in major Chinese cities. If we acknowledge the promo-
tion of free speech as the opportunities brought about by social media, the hidden
challenges can be revealed through this value structure—social media can also be
used as a tool of surveillance by big brother to control the discussion on air pollution
as well as a medium of advertisement by private companies to sell relevant products
(e.g., masks) to prevent air pollution-related symptoms. The implications of social
media are multifaceted. Therefore, the value structure can be applied to examine the
impacts of social media on the rapidly evolving Digital Earth. In the following sec-
tions, we discuss the opportunities provided by social media as well as the potential
challenges.
12.3
Opportunities: Human Dynamics Prediction
As a newly chartered territory for human activities, social media has resulted in
tremendous electronic footprints. Such footprints represent a large number of the
population and can be used to predict human dynamics on the ground via the rela-
tionships between the spread of information, user characteristics, and message con-
tents. In this section, we discuss how social media can be used for different aspects
of human society, including public health, emergency response, decision making,
and social equity promotion.
12.3.1
Public Health
Social media platforms can be used to mitigate the spread of pandemics and associ-
ated anxiety. Scholars have used sentiment analysis and spatial analysis to examine
how social media communication conveys information about contagious and infec-
tious diseases and alerts the public, through identifying, tracking, and visualizing the
behavioral patterns of users (Zadeh et al. 2019). For instance, Ye et al. (2018a, b)
explored public health-related rumors during disease outbreaks and evaluate how
such media framing sets the tone negatively, affecting the quality of disease outbreak
detection and prediction, using the diffusion of Ebola rumors in social media net-
works as a case study. Sharma et al. (2017) ﬁnd that the inaccurate Facebook posts are
more popular than those with accurate and relevant information about the Zika virus.
Villar and Marsh (2018) studied the impact of social media health communication of
Ebola and Zika, concluding that the effect relies on users’ attitudes and trust towards
authorities and the media. Average citizens and ordinary social media users have
very limited knowledge regarding the accuracy and relevancy of infectious diseases
spreading over time and across space as well as concerning complications. As a force
in health communication, social media data could be utilized to deﬁne a temporal
extent of the infection and to populate a spatial database of reported occurrences
of the disease. Additionally, social media data can be used to track and predict the
12
Social Media and Social Awareness
429
emergence and spread of infectious diseases and distribution across various spatial
and temporal scales. As a self-reported volunteered information platform and useful
surveillance tool, social media feeds outperform those from ofﬁcial or government
outlets in timeliness. They can also aid in gaining insights into the opinions and
perceptions of the public.
12.3.2
Emergency Response
The use of massive computer-mediated communication in emergency response and
disaster management has captured considerable interest from both the general public
and decision makers. Social media enables fast interpersonal communication during
crises through information dissemination, early warnings, environmental awareness,
and public participation in disaster-affected areas, allowing for emergency workers
to respond more speedily and capably (Hashimoto and Ohama 2014; Finch et al.
2016). As Yin et al. (2012) argue, “this growing use of social media during crises
offers new information sources from which the right authorities can enhance emer-
gency situation awareness. Survivors in the impacted areas can report on-the-ground
information about what they are seeing, hearing, and experiencing during natural
disasters. People from surrounding areas can provide nearly real-time observations
about disaster scenes, such as aerial images and photos.” Moreover, since social
media users can access information posted by ofﬁcial agencies through following
their accounts, organizations and agencies can leverage social media as a platform
to post authoritative situational announcements and communicate with the public in
emergency situations and to potentially retrieve and verify on-the-ground informa-
tion using the public as the information source (Wang et al. 2016). Palen et al. (2009)
examined the consequences of digital communication and information sharing on
emergency response in the context of the Virginia Tech massacre. Chen et al. (2016)
proposed real-time geo-tagged tweet collection and recording in a distributed geo-
database as well as real-time data redistribution using a Web GIS application. This
system was applied to a hypothetical mass evacuation using tweets from Hurricane
Joaquin in 2015.
12.3.3
Decision Making
As a new kind of user-generated geospatial information, social media data could be
invaluable to political agenda-setting that needs to be aware of location-based topic
distribution. For example, the data could help political strategists analyze the tweets
of residents or voters in a given geographical area. Politicians can gauge people’s
reactions by monitoring the communication among Twitter accounts regarding policy
issues. Ye et al. (2017) employed voting tweets regarding a water bond in California
to highlight place-based situational awareness. Convention and visitors’ bureaus may
430
X. Ye et al.
focus on ‘hot button’ issues in certain places within their cities or regions. These data
could provide operational indicators about places that are most visited or preferred by
visitors, which can inform the marketing strategies relevant to these locations. Local
governments could analyze social media messages to determine whether a proposed
construction project would be favored by the public or if other proposed projects
would be perceived positively by their constituents. Ye et al. (2018a, b) examined
how the Multilevel Model of Meme Diffusion (M3D) captures the debates regarding
death penalty abolishment across space. At the intracity scale, Liu et al. (2018a, b)
assessed the utility efﬁciency of subway stations in a Chinese city by matching
the capacity of train services and the travel needs using social media data. Deng
et al. (2018) analyzed how geotagged tweets are associated with hourly electric
consumption at the building level, given the assumption that tweeting behavior is
highly related to human activities.
12.3.4
Social Equity Promotion
Most social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram are designed for
the general public; few are dedicated to speciﬁc groups (e.g., LGBTQ, photographers,
natural disaster victims, etc.). An in-depth analysis and visualization of the speciﬁc
groups can promote social equity among different groups. Social awareness of where
they are is the ﬁrst and foremost step in enabling local residents and governments
to recognize the necessity to treat these underrepresented populations equally. For
example, Jack’d, a dedicated gay social networking app, enables its users to com-
municate online with those who are physically nearby. Through collecting online
locational information from Jack’d, a 3D distribution of the gay community in Bei-
jing were visualized (Zhao et al. 2017). By overlapping this distribution with land-
marks such as major roads, university campuses, shopping malls and gay-friendly
places (e.g., gay bars, gay saunas, gay-friendly gyms, gay-friendly parks and public
restrooms attracting gay activities, etc.), the characteristics of this underrepresented
group’s distribution can be revealed. Gay people in Beijing primarily concentrate in
the northwestern and eastern parts of the city. The northwestern area is the center for
higher education, with several famous universities. In the eastern area of Beijing, the
area from Sanlitun to Worker’s stadium is acknowledged as a recreation center for
LGBT people. To the south, a few famous gay-friendly residential communities are
surrounded by gay saunas; to the east, there are several high-end residential commu-
nities and shopping malls in the Guomao and Sihui subdistricts. This 3D distribution
reveals a hot spot of gay activities in the Tongzhou district. This may result from the
relatively low house rent and convenient accessibility to Chaoyang and other local
urban centers for hangouts. Through this 3D distribution of the gay community’s
electronic footprint, the local public health agencies can provide corresponding ser-
vices for the gay community and organize more targeted activities as an effective
means to promote social equity.

Challenges: Fake Electronic Footprints
In addition to those obvious opportunities in human dynamics prediction, challenges
inherently in social media are often ignored. As Chun et al. (2019) argue, “uncertainty
and context pose fundamental challenges in GIScience and geographic research.
Geospatial data are imbued with errors (e.g., measurement and sampling) and various
typesofuncertaintythatoftenobfuscateanyunderstandingoftheeffectsofcontextual
or environmental inﬂuences on human behaviors and experiences.” Although social
media has been touted as a platform to authentically present human trajectories and
their mobilities, rumors, spooﬁngs and privacy concerns, not limited to the physical
world,arealsoexistonDigitalEarth.Inthissense,Wecannotimmediatelytreatsocial
media messages as accurate and credible without considering the above-mentioned
issues.
12.4.1
Rumors
The unmoderated nature of social media user’s posting behavior might lead to the
accumulation of invalidated and unveriﬁed information and news involving spec-
ulation and uncertainty regarding social events (Ye et al. 2018a, b). Jones et al.
(2017) found those who relying on social media for updates of a campus lockdown
tend to suffer from greater distress due to their increased exposure to conﬂicting
content in social media channels. Rumors are considered messages or forms of inter-
action among people about certain events that may not be true. As a nonprofessional
medium, social media platforms can spread rumors. However, some information
from reliable sources can minimize rumor propagation, lowering the level of anxiety
in the virtual community. Zubiaga et al. (2018) noted that the openness of social
media platforms also enables the study of user behavior on sharing and discussing
both long-standing and newly emerging rumors based on natural language processing
and data mining methods, especially for four components: rumor detection, rumor
tracking, rumor stance classiﬁcation, and rumor veracity classiﬁcation.
12.4.2
Location Spooﬁng
Location spooﬁng is a deliberate geographic practice to disguise one’s actual loca-
tion with inconsistent locational information (Zhao and Sui 2017). It facilitates the
spoofer to virtually travel to places of interest for various purposes. For smartphones,
the spooﬁng mechanism can be divided into three steps, (1) blocking the positioning
service of a smartphone to acquire the actual locational information, (2) generating
inconsistent locational information, and (3) transmitting it to an operating LBSM
app (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Pokémon Go, etc.) on a smartphone (Zhao and Zhang
432
X. Ye et al.
2018). As a result, the LBSM app mistakes the fake location as where the oper-
ating smartphone really is. Speciﬁcally, the positioning service relies on a hybrid
approach that integrates three major positioning techniques: built-in GPS, surround-
ing WiFi network triangulation, and cellular tower network triangulation. For these
three techniques, the more accurate, the higher priority in deciding the ﬁnal result. In
practice, the fundamental function of location spooﬁng is to downgrade the accuracy
of the positioning technique or totally block the positioning function. There are three
common location spooﬁng techniques, in terms of falsifying the MAC addresses of
surrounding WiFi routers, spooﬁng GPS signals in the environment, and mocking
in-transit locational information. The last method is predominantly adopted by dedi-
cated mobile android apps for location spooﬁng. Such apps enable users to virtually
visit a place other than the actual location. An example is presented below to clarify
this.
In reaction to the 2009 presidential election in Iran, the government of Iran regu-
larly monitors all activities on social networks (Ansari 2012). During the campaign,
social network sites were suddenly blocked, and online political activity became the
target of harsh criticism and reprisals from the government. To prevent this surveil-
lance and protect online protestors, many internationally based Green Movement
supporters spread disinformation over Twitter to mislead local police. Foreign sup-
porters who were not in Iran decided to set their online locations to Tehran to protect
those who were tweeting from Tehran. This strategy may have helped some Iranian
opposition leaders avoid persecution, but also made it impossible to understand the
real impacts of Twitter on the protest.
12.4.3
Privacy Abuse
When users share content and their data on social media, there is a risk that such
content and data are collected and exploited in a way that is not expected by the
users. This poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy for user data and calls for
the responsibility of the network administrators, researchers and users to preserve
privacy in social networks. Two broad classes of privacy issues in social networks—
user-user privacy and user-third party privacy—are discussed below.
In social media, one user might share content about another user or party. Although
this mechanism helps spread the content over the networks efﬁciently, it inherently
presents a tremendous risk for privacy violation. For instance, your friends might
share a picture you posted, showing you were in a restaurant with another friend.
The picture sharing might be done without your consent and accidentally reveal your
location, private information that you do not want to share beyond your friend list. To
prevent such privacy breaches, social media administrators have implemented mech-
anisms for users to make complaints and request that the content be removed from
the networks. However, before the content can be reviewed and revoked, it might
have caused some detrimental consequences for the users. It would be more effective
if such content dissemination was validated at the very beginning. Addressing the
12
Social Media and Social Awareness
433
user-user privacy issue requires collaboration among scientists from different disci-
plines, including computer scientists, GIScientists, and psychologists. For example,
Kekulluoglu et al. (2017) studied a hybrid negotiation architecture with a reciprocity
mechanism to mimic the social responsibility in reality, and a credit system was used
to encourage agents/users to respect other’s privacy in social media.
Regarding user-third party privacy, content and data generated by social media
users might be collected by different third parties for various purposes, potentially
causing serious data leaks and violating the privacy of users. A retailer might retrieve
user proﬁles and posts to deliver appropriate ads to the users or an upstart voter-
proﬁling company could exploit such information to characterize the personalities of
users and inﬂuence their voting decisions (e.g., the recent Facebook privacy crisis and
data leak with Cambridge Analytica on American elections described in Rosenberg
et al. (2018)). Another example is researchers who query user data to infer various
user characteristics (e.g., depression, drug abuse) (Choudhury et al. 2013). While
such inferences can provide valuable insights into different social problems and
support monitoring systems for social issues, the leaks of such inferred information
for speciﬁc users can cause biases and affect the users’ ability to participate in social
activities (e.g., jobs, school admission). Consequently, it is important to develop
technological strategies to ensure privacy in user data-related activities in social
media. The Future of Privacy Forum and DataGuidance (2018) delivered the report
“Comparing privacy laws: GDPR v. CCPA.” This report compares the European
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effective on May 25, 2018,
and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) scheduled to be in effect
on January 1, 2020. Both laws would also fundamentally inﬂuence social media
platforms in collecting/sharing/employing users’ data online and ofﬂine.
12.5
From Awareness to Action
A close scrutiny of the opportunities and challenges would raise our awareness of
the potential capacity of social media in understanding human dynamics. As Yang
et al. (2016, p. 61) argued, “the convergence of social media and GIS provides an
opportunity to reconcile space-based GIS and place-based social media.” Driven by
this awareness, GIScientists should take actions to model the geographies of social
media, propose innovative approaches to location spooﬁng screening and connect
the virtual world in social media with the real word to better explain social media
phenomena.
12.5.1
Modeling the Geographies of Social Media
Tracking and predicting the diffusion of social media information from a neighbor-
hood to a global scale raises a series of questions such as where and when certain
434
X. Ye et al.
topics will be discussed and become popular. Sui and Goodchild (2011) suggested
two hypotheses to test the nature of social media message diffusion such as geo-
tagged hashtags spread through Twitter. The spatial inﬂuence model states that the
spatially nearby locations tend to be impacted in the near future, and the community
afﬁnity inﬂuence model asserts that such dissemination would occur between func-
tionally connected places. However, the reality is usually a combination of these two
models. Such predictions will be useful for policymakers to estimate the spatial and
functional inﬂuence of economic downturns facilitated by supply-chain networks.
The community afﬁnities are expected to enhance the prediction power of purely
spatial models.
12.5.2
Detecting Location Spooﬁng Through Geographic
Knowledge
If we examine location spooﬁng from the traditional standard of scientiﬁc data,
it is highly unlikely that such “fake” information is generated by environmental
uncertainties, measurement uncertainties, or limited knowledge about measurement
(Zhang and Goodchild 2002). Today, location spooﬁng cannot simply be treated as
fake data, as these data are associated with complicated generative motivations from
different stakeholders, governments, local business or average social media users.
To identify location spooﬁng, it is necessary to determine the motivations why the
author produces that location, and then judge whether it is spoofed or not.
Therefore, we must seek appropriate solutions to the positioning inconsistency
and the motivations for spooﬁng. Usually, self-reporting (e.g., survey, questionnaire)
or observations can qualitatively collect and interpret human motivations that trigger
the generation of positional inconsistency. However, in practice, it is difﬁcult to
measure the real motivation: admittedly, the survey or questionnaire participants
might not report their true intentions of location spooﬁng due to the fear of being
recognized as location spoofers or rumormongers.
The positioning inconsistency in spooﬁng can be quantitatively detected. Theoret-
ically, any spooﬁng detection is supposed to unveil a certain underlying positioning
inconsistency. As Goodchild (2013) indicated, a geospatial accuracy model inter-
prets how a world is constructed geographically. In this sense, spooﬁng detection is
meant to detect scenarios that do not follow the way in which the world is geograph-
ically constructed. One crucial theoretical framework to build up the geographic
truth is Hägerstrand’s Time Geography (1970). This analytical framework concep-
tualizes the trajectory of each individual as a life path, which is restricted by several
predeﬁned human behavioral constraints in space and time. Meanwhile, a series of
analytical tools to measure human dynamics are provided by Time Geography, such
as space-time path, prism, and cube. Zhao and Sui (2017) provided a Bayesian time
geographic estimation approach to determine the places that an examined user is
unlikely to appear. Time-geographic density estimation (TGDE) was used to model
12
Social Media and Social Awareness
435
the human appearance in a region over time. TGDE can convert trajectories (e.g.,
a time sequence of historical geo-tags from an individual) to a visiting probability
distribution of spatial positions over time. This model can effectively convey the
behavioral constraints and describe where and when an individual is more likely to
visit. A location with a lower probability value is more likely to be spoofed. Moreover,
with the rise of deep learning such as long short-term memory, LSTM (Greff et al.
2017), it is worth investigating application of deep learning techniques in detecting
fake location information. For example, given a set of sequenced historical geo-tags
of an individual, LSTM can be used to model the sequential information and build
deep learning-based classiﬁcation methods.
12.5.3
Connecting Social Media with the Real World
In social media, people share their thoughts and emotions about events in the real
world. Such events might be explicitly mentioned or implicitly referred to in their
posts. For instance, some social media posts might explicitly include a link to a
news article they would like to discuss whereas other posts might express the users’
attitude on some events without citing those events. In many inference problems for
social media data (e.g., sentiment analysis, opinion mining), it is crucial to determine
the corresponding realistic events to fully understand and explain the trends and
phenomena in social media (i.e., connecting social media with the real world). One
example is that social media posts concerning implicit events where the absence of
the implied events would clearly impede accurate analysis of the posts.
To model the real world, we can resort to public information resources such as
news articles and public knowledge resources such as Wikipedia and Freebase (Bol-
lacker et al. 2008). These resources cover a wide range of events across various
aspects of life. They are also updated with new events in almost real time due to
the recent advances in publication technologies, promoting these public information
resources as a digital counterpart of the real world. Consequently, we can connect
social media data with the real word via the reﬂected world of public information
resources. The major technical challenges to accomplish this connection involve
the ability to autonomously extract events from those public resources (e.g., news
articles) and the capacity to link the information in social media to the appropriate
detected events. Such challenges would require a deep analysis of the semantics of the
information presented in both (e.g., the posts in social media and the events in public
resources) to identify the events and connections with high accuracy. Fortunately,
deepsemanticunderstandingofsuchinformationisbeingactivelyinvestigatedinarti-
ﬁcial intelligence research, including natural language processing, computer vision,
graph modeling and machine learning. For instance, many recent studies have shown
that events in news articles can be effectively curated using deep learning techniques,
a branch of machine learning that is capable of automatically inducing the underlying
representations for data to achieve high extraction performance (Nguyen et al. 2016;
Nguyen and Grishman 2018; Nguyen and Nguyen 2019). As these event extraction
436
X. Ye et al.
techniques can also recognize the time and locations at which the events occur, they
can be beneﬁcial for GIScientists in geographical research of populations on social
media and the real world. In addition, deep learning might also present effective
solutions for the problem of linking social media data with realistic events due to its
recently demonstrated capacity for embedding and representation learning for var-
ious problems. Once converged, such advances in these ﬁelds of computer science
might eventually offer an opportunity to connect the virtual world and real world by
solving the aforementioned technical challenges.
Finally, the realistic events from public information resources enable novel
semantic-based solutions to combat the problems of rumors or fake news in social
media. An important property of the public resources discussed in this section is
that they generally capture trustful information/events, as such information is ver-
iﬁed by the media administrators for accuracy and correctness. This is one reason
why news articles are usually slower than social media in presenting the informa-
tion to the public. Consequently, if the social media information can be accurately
linked and compared with the information/events in the trustful information sources,
novel detection and tracking techniques can be proposed to prevent rumors and fact-
check the information spread over social media. Artiﬁcial intelligence research can
provide the fundamental technologies to tackle these problems, as demonstrated in
recent research in natural language processing and deep learning (i.e., Yin and Roth
2018).

Conclusion
As a crucial platform for human dynamics and activities, social media content can
be mined in multiple approaches to determine how individuals connect and share
information as well as purposefully move across scales and resolutions (Croitoru
et al. 2013; Miller et al. 2019). When social media activities are attached with loca-
tional information, these online human activities can generate tremendous electronic
footprints on Digital Earth. Especially when merging with other digital overlays of
authoritative data through multisource data fusion, such as land use, urban planning,
and natural resources data, powerful interoperation and prediction that require both
electronic footprints and digital overlays on Digital Earth become feasible with the
optimal weights for combination (De Albuquerque et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2019). These
digital overlays serve as the socioenvironmental context within which the geosocial
media dynamics and events occur and evolve, calling for scientiﬁc cross-fertilization
of many separate domains toward an integrated science of human dynamics.
In this chapter, we introduce the opportunities and challenges that human
dynamics-centered social media bring to Digital Earth. We review the information
diffusion of social media, the multifaced implications of social media, and some
real-world cases. Social media will facilitate the prediction of human dynamics in
a wide spectrum of aspects, including public health, emergency response, decision

making and social equity promotion. Social media will also bring unintended chal-
lenges for Digital Earth, such as rumors and fake location spooﬁng. Considering the
multifaceted implications, this chapter calls for GIScientists to raise their awareness
of the complex impacts of social media and urges them to model the geographies of
social media as well as ﬁlter fake locations through geographic knowledge, targeting
a more robust geosocial knowledge discovery. Social media will continue to evolve,
along with the development of human society. Social media has become a crucial
part of human activities on Digital Earth. Any effort that ignores the importance of
social media will bring the effort into question. Therefore, the study of social media
provides new data sources and data collection methods about real-world activities
and happenings, and social media help us in profoundly understanding ourselves as
a unique species living both on the Earth and in Digital Earth.

Digital Earth for Sustainable
Development Goals
Graciela Metternicht, Norman Mueller and Richard Lucas
Abstract Sustainable development is nothing new, but it has proven notoriously
difﬁcult to implement in practice. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
with 17 goals, 169 targets and 232 associated indicators, was approved at the 2015
UN General Assembly and addresses the economic, social and environmental pillars
of development, aspiring to attain by 2030 a sustainable future that balances equitable
prosperity within planetary boundaries. While the goals are universal (i.e., applicable
to both developing and developed countries), it is left to individual countries to
establish national Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets according to their
own priorities and level of ambition in terms of the scale and pace of transformation
aspired to.

Fundamentals of Digital Earth for the Sustainable
Development Goals
The Digital Earth (DE) exists in parallel to the physical Earth along with some
translating elements between them (Sudmanns et al. 2019). Chapter 1 describes the
origin, evolution and main elements of Digital Earth, and the links between Digital
Earth, Big Data (Chap. 9) and big Earth data. Guo (2017) argues that, from the
perspective of big data, big Earth data inherits big data’s ‘Vs’ (volume, velocity and

variety) and, in this context, DE can be considered to be big Earth data. Furthermore,
as big Earth data research focuses on synthesis of systematic observations of the
Earth, as well as data-intensive methods for studying Earth system models, based on
the premise of increased knowledge discovery (Chap. 1), Digital Earth can support
countries in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Through analysis of recent literature and a case study, this chapter collects and
presents evidence of the potential and limitations of Digital Earth for systematic
generation of information and knowledge for use in measuring progress towards
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We frame the analysis and discussion
around priorities for implementation (ICSU, ISSU 2015), including:
(a)
the design of SDG indicator metrics at national levels and how Digital Earth,
through the Analysis Ready Data (ARD) concept, can contribute to that end
(b) harmonized national metrics for SDG implementation, including for baseline
determination and target setting
(c)
setting up monitoring platforms for tracking progress towards the SDGs
(d) knowledge needs for assessing implementation of actions and strategies towards
achieving set SDG targets
(e)
governance and institutional arrangements, including multi-stakeholder partic-
ipation.
The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 13.2 identiﬁes the
information needs of countries for the implementation of the SDGs, including for the
SDG Global Indicator Framework (GIF). Section 13.3 summarizes the ﬁndings of
recent research and practice on the use of Digital Earth (including Earth Observation1
and social sensing) in support of the SDGs. Section 13.4 presents a national case
study of multi-stakeholder engagement in the operationalization of the Indicator
Framework of the Sustainable Development Goals with Earth Observations. The
chapter closes (Sect. 13.5) with an outlook on the prospects of Digital Earth and big
Earth Data in relation to the SDGs.
13.2
Information and Knowledge Relevant to National
Implementation of the SDGs
The SDGs provide a coherent, evidence-based framework for development planning
and programming at a national level (Allen et al. 2017a). The goals and targets
essentially set the desired destination for development through to 2030 and provide
a framework for monitoring progress. This section introduces the metrics agreed for
monitoring and reporting of the SDGs, and broadly identiﬁes data and information
requirements for their implementation.
1The Earth Observation data in this chapter refers to the deﬁnition provided by Nativi et al. (2019).

13.2.1
How the SDGs Are Monitored and Reported
The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) was established in March 2016 to monitor
progress towards achieving the SDGs (UN Statistical Commission 2016). The SDG
indicators have been grouped into three different tiers according to the level of data
availability and methodological development. Of the 232 SDG indicators that make
up the GIF, as of March 2019, 101 are classiﬁed as being Tier I. This means that
the indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology
and standards, and the data are regularly compiled for at least 50% of participating
countries. The remaining indicators are Tier II (94 indicators), which are conceptually
clear but for which the data are not regularly produced by participating countries,
or Tier III (34 indicators), for which no internationally established methodology
or standards are yet available. Six indicators are determined as having several tiers
(Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals 2019). Hence,
three years after the adoption of the GIF, less than half (44%) of the SDG indicators
can be conﬁdently populated.
It is worth noting that the SDG indicators are essentially performance metrics
and, as such, are reported regularly at national levels through National Voluntary
Reports (NVRs) (UNGA 2015, paras. 79 and 84), and annually at the global level.
The latter is undertaken by the UN Secretary General to inform the High-Level
Political Forum based on a selection of indicators from the GIF for which data are
available, as mandated by the General Assembly (UNGA 2015, para. 83). For Tier I
and II indicators, the availability of data at national levels may not necessarily align
with the global tier classiﬁcation, and countries can create their own tier classiﬁcation
for implementation.
13.2.2
Information Needs for Implementation of the SDGs
Recent research (Allen et al. 2018, 2019) has identiﬁed challenges for implementing
the SDGs that, in turn, inﬂuence information and knowledge needs.
(a)
The comprehensiveness of scope makes prioritization essential.
(b) The goals are integrated, with very complex feedback and dynamics. This is a
signiﬁcant change from prior narrow, linear approaches to development.
(c)
The SDG targets have complex trade-offs and synergies, and conﬂict can emerge
from the interactions between targets and goals (Lusseau and Mancini 2019;
Nilsson et al. 2016; Le Blanc 2015; Allen et al. 2019).
(d) Currently, there is a weak conceptual understanding of these interlinkages,
which limits the ability to respond with coherent policy and management across
sectors (Allen et al. 2018; Spangenberg 2017).
Challenges related to aspects of target-setting are that the system of SDGs is not
coherent, but rather a network of interlinked targets and a reﬂection of the political
446
G. Metternicht et al.
mapping of development priorities rather than a reﬂection of how the Earth Sys-
tem works (Le Blanc 2015). Furthermore, the SDGs do not reﬂect the cause–effect
relationships that are needed to understand how the achievement of one target could
impact on the other targets. Hence, national implementation of the SDGs requires
more than information on performance metrics. For example, timely data in support
of policy formulation and targeted interventions may be of much greater impor-
tance for countries aiming to advance the implementation of the SDGs according
to their national circumstances than simply providing a metric around an agreed
global indicator. Furthermore, implementation of the SDGs at national levels also
requires determining a baseline for 2015, deciding on targets for 2030, as well as a
system for tracking the progress towards the set targets, monitoring the performance
of decisions (actions, policies and strategies) and reporting advances using the GIF.
Building an evidence-based framework for national implementation, monitoring
and reporting of the SDGs requires government agencies (including National Statis-
tics Ofﬁces) to address the what, why and how of data and information provision
(Fig. 13.1).
(a)
What is happening requires baseline assessment of indicators related to SDG
targets,identifyingpriorities(e.g.,whatSDGtargetsorgoalsacountryislagging
behind) and the identiﬁcation of data and information gaps needed for such
assessment, as summarized in Allen et al. (2017b).
(b) Why it is happening (e.g. drivers of and pressures leading to (un)sustainable
development) relates to the need for systems analysis of interlinkages between
SDG targets, understanding of cause–effect relationships, feedbacks and
dynamics, and the identiﬁcation of leverage points for actions and strategies
to accomplish the transformational changes that the SDGs aim for.
(c)
How to accomplish changes, demands that countries answering the above ques-
tions also understand how data and information are to be obtained and integrated.

State of the Art for the SDGs in DE
Whether 3Vs, 5Vs (including volatility and veracity, as suggested by Hammer et al.
2017) or 6Vs (including volatility, veracity and value: Fig. 13.2), big data may offer
new cost-effective or efﬁcient ways of compiling indicators, improving timeliness,
and compiling linkable datasets, and also open the way for cross-cutting analyses
that may help with better understanding of the causation and identiﬁcation of relevant
and coherent policy interventions (see Fig. 13.1).
When adopting the SDGs, the United Nations (UN) Assembly recognized the
contribution that could be made by Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial infor-
mation (i.e., big Earth data) in supporting and tracking progress towards the SDGs
(UNGA 2015, para. 76). Analysis and interpretation of big Earth data, including
Earth Observation, have much to offer the SDGs and other multi-lateral environmen-
tal agreements (Sudmanns et al. 2019). However, MacFeely (2019) makes a case for
the challenges that big data face (legal, technical and ethical) concerning their use in
compiling SDG indicators. National statistical ofﬁces, government agencies and UN
agencies, which are the custodians of speciﬁc SDGs tasked with implementing the
Fig. 13.2 The 6Vs of big data for ofﬁcial statistics. Modiﬁed from Hammer et al. (2017)
448
G. Metternicht et al.
GIF, face concerns about whether big data are representative and stable enough to be
used consistently for compiling the SDG indicators and also their operationalization.
For example, in the Big Data Project Inventory compiled by the UN Global Working
Group on Big Data, 34 national statistical ofﬁces from around the world registered
109 separate big data projects and their potential contribution to the SDG imple-
mentation. Most data projects focus on goals 3, 8, 11 and, with a lesser emphasis,
goals 2, 15 and 16. Though promising, most projects have not yet moved beyond
the planning stage, and others are dealing with legal issues related to data protection
(MacFeely 2019). Speciﬁc to the EO community are challenges for consistently and
systematically turning satellite and other remote sensing data into valuable global
information layers in support of effective implementation of the SDGs.
In late 2018, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) compiled
a report on the potential of satellite EO for the SDGs (Paganini et al. 2018), and
their ﬁndings suggest that EO data has a role to play in quantifying around 40 of the
169 Targets, and around 30 of the 232 Indicators. The CEOS argues that there is an
unrealized potential for EO data to contribute to the Indicator Framework, with only
a third of its data being routinely exploited today. This is based on the premise that
only 12 out of the 30 indicators identiﬁed are listed as Tier I.
Moreover, the report points to the importance of EO in relation to Goal 6 (Clean
water and sanitation), Goal 11 (Sustainable cities), Goal 14 (Life below water), and
Goal 15 (Life on land). Most of the perceived contribution of EO towards these goals
has been around the provision of information in relation to the mapping of land cover,
land productivity, above ground biomass, soil moisture content, and water extent or
quality characteristics, as well as air quality and pollution parameters (Table 13.1). A
2016 compilation of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) appraised the potential
of EO and geospatial information for informing all SDGs, although the document
was vague in terms of speciﬁc contributions to SDG targets and indicators. A sub-
sequent joint GEO-CEOS report (CEOS-GEO EO4SDG 2017) further investigated
the potential of big Earth Data (EO and geo-information) for supporting countries in
the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, arguing that it
could contribute to the implementation of 29 indicators (through direct measurement
or indirect support) and 71 targets of 16 goals (but not all indicators of these targets).
By referencing national-scale satellite datasets (e.g. Terra/Aqua MODIS, Landsat,
and Sentinel), Metternicht et al. (2018) concluded that EO satellite-derived infor-
mation tends to have a more indirect contribution to the SDG targets and indicators
(i.e. use as proxies). Using data available from the Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem
Research Network platform (TERN), the study ascertained that EO-derived infor-
mation was most relevant to Goal targets 15, 14, 13, 11, 6, 3, 2 and 1, and, to a lesser
extent, Goal 9 (Fig. 13.3).
The potential of EO to support the SDG indicator framework appears in the
biosphere cluster (Fig. 13.4) and to a lesser the SDG indicators related to society
and the economy. This concurs with the argument of Plag and Jules-Plag (2019)
that very few indicators can currently be quantiﬁed based on information extracted
from EO alone because of the strong focus of the SDGs on human needs and the
bias toward social and economic information and the built environment. Traditional

(yellow) (Metternicht et al. 2018)
EO techniques are designed for extracting information on environmental variables,
with only a few being related to the built environment and associated infrastructure
(e.g., built-up areas and roads). Hence, there are limitations on the possibility of
EO alone producing reliable metrics for SDG indicators (see Table 13.1); however,
approaches underpinned by big Earth data do have some potential, as evidenced in
recent research by Kussul et al. (2019), Foody et al. (2019), Freire et al. (2018), and
Corbane et al. (2017). Speciﬁcally:
• meta-optimization of EO with external data-intensive infrastructure has led to
improved mapping of built-up areas in support of the global human settlement
layer (Corbane et al. 2017)
• national mapping of SDG indicators 15.1.1, 15.3.1 and 2.4.1 has been achieved
through synergy of in situ and multi-resolution satellite data (Kussul et al. 2019)
• big Earth Data (global census data and satellite-derived built-up area maps) has
enabled enhanced mapping of population distribution along coastlines (Freire et al.
2018)
• EO and machine learning have enabled mapping of sites associated with slavery,
in support of SDG target 8.7 (“take immediate and effective measures to eradicate
forcedlabour,endmodernslaveryandhumantrafﬁckingandsecuretheprohibition
and elimination of the worst forms of child labour”) (Foody et al. 2019).

In summary, EO data does not directly deliver the SDG indicators agreed by the
Inter-Agency and Expert Group (IAEG) on SDGs; rather, it provides a diversity of
spatio-temporal information that can then be related to the indicator framework. For
example, directly observed indicators can be speciﬁc biophysical aspects of entities
(e.g., land cover status and type) that provide evidence for monitoring advances
towardsSDGtargets.Asanexample,changesinland-coverstatescanbeanindication
of land improvement or land degradation in SDG target 15.3. Indirect cues derived
from EO data can provide evidence for SDG domains related to human health, cities
and infrastructure, ecosystem health and so on (Paganini et al. 2018; Sudmanns et al.
2019). Few studies, however, refer to speciﬁc SDG indicator metrics; many papers
and reports highlight the potential of Earth Observation for targets and goals but fall
short of being speciﬁc regarding the operationalization of Digital Earth for the SDG
target or indicator.
For the full information potential of big EO data in support of the SDGs to be real-
ized, approaches are needed that broaden the use of EO beyond specialized scientiﬁc
communities and that support decision makers with the knowledge required by sys-
tematically analyzing all available observations by converting them into meaningful
geophysical variables. Data Cubes (see Chap. 21) apply the concept of satellite ARD
and are facilitating access to large spatio-temporal data (Giuliani et al. 2017). This
13
Digital Earth for Sustainable Development Goals
453
enables the coupling of EO with other big data such as demographic, economic,
climatic, or administrative data, which are needed to make indicators and analysis
more relevant and targeted to the SDGs. Furthermore, some of the proposed SDG
targets relate to the so-called ‘means of implementation’, namely technology transfer
and capacity building (i.e. SDG17; SDG targets 13.1, 1.3.3 and 16.8). In this regard,
Digital Earth and EO infrastructure, as currently offered by Australia’s TERN Land-
scape initiative (TERN 2017) and other major international and national systems for
big Earth data (e.g. Google Earth Engine, Amazon Web Services, Earth Server, Earth
Observation Data Centre, Copernicus Data and Exploitation Platform-Deutschland,
United States Geological Survey Earth Explorer, Swiss Data Cube, Digital Earth
Australia, Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth, and GEOEssential of the Group on
Earth Observations), could serve as ‘methodological frameworks’ and examples of
good practice for cross-institutional governance models, thus indirectly contributing
to progress towards these targets.
The case study presented hereafter is an example of how EO can be a promising
complement to traditional national statistics. Digital Earth Australia (DEA) aligns
with the current trends in EO of having open data policies and using cloud comput-
ing and data cubes for improving big Earth data integration and analysis, thereby
strengthening environmental data and indicators (Dhu et al. 2017). In particular, this
case shows how the analysis capabilities of DEA (see Chap. 21 for infrastructure)
can be used to draw together and effectively link data from multiple domains in
support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in
Australia.
13.4
Case Study of Australia: Operationalizing
the Indicator Framework of the SDGs Through DE
and a Participatory Process
In July 2018, Australia produced its ﬁrst Voluntary National Review (VNR) of the
SDGs (Australian Government 2018). Australia’s consideration of the SDG Indi-
cators has been a whole-government exercise. The Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) undertook a data-mapping exercise for the SDGs, in conjunction with lead
agencies, exploring both ABS and other government-held data sources to identify
those germane to supporting monitoring and reporting on the SDGs. A Reporting
Platform2 was created to: (a) house identiﬁed Australian government datasets rel-
evant to the development of the country’s SDG indicator framework; (b) assist in
identifying new datasets; and (c) reﬁne the SDG indicators, particularly as the move
from a Tier III to a Tier I or II occurs and where additional datasets may be needed.
An inter-agency governance agreement assigned the responsibility for following up
and completing additional data sets to individual agencies (particularly those that
hold datasets relevant to the SDG indicator framework).
2https://www.sdgdata.gov.au/.
454
G. Metternicht et al.
For the ﬁrst VNR, a total of 118 indicators were reported online using data drawn
from a national indicator dataset. For 57 indicators, potential data sources were
identiﬁed. However, further analysis is needed to ensure the data are suitable for
reporting and are comparable to the globally agreed methodology for each UN SDG
indicator. 12 indicators were not reported either because the indicator was not relevant
to Australia or because no suitable Australian government data source exists for
the indicator. Another 57 were not considered because, at the time of reporting, a
globally agreed methodology for these UN SDG indicators is lacking (i.e., Tier III).
Therefore, Australia did not investigate potential data sources. In summary, the ﬁrst
Australian VNR took a narrative approach, addressing each of the SDGs, though
no baseline was created. Targets were not speciﬁed and Australia had complete and
relevant datasets for only half of the SDG indicators. The Australian government
has acknowledged that EO technology can help progress towards the completion of
datasets and, in tandem, inform decision-makers about performance against SDG
targets and indicators (Australia Government 2018).
In this regard, EO-derived information could help in setting baselines against
which SDG targets could be set and, in turn, measure progress against agreed goals—
aspects that the ﬁrst VNR did not tackle. Germane to this point is the DEA initiative
led by Geoscience Australia, which has enabled the compilation, analysis and inter-
pretation of decades of satellite sensor (largely Landsat) data into information and
insights about Australia’s terrestrial and marine ecosystems using ARD standards
(Dhu et al. 2017; Lewis et al. 2016). Building on the DEA infrastructure (see Chap.
21), Geoscience Australia is leading an inter-institutional initiative to produce reli-
able, standardized, continental-scale maps of land cover and land-cover dynamics
across Australia at 25 m spatial resolution using multi-scale time series of Landsat
and Copernicus Sentinel datasets. This approach builds on the Earth Observation
Data for Ecosystem Monitoring (EODESM; Lucas and Mitchell 2017), which is
fully described in Lucas et al. (2019a) and which provides multi-scale and temporal
land-cover and evidence-based change maps by integrating environmental variables
retrieved from EO data and utilizing the framework of the Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) Land Cover Classiﬁcation System (LCCS; Version 2, Di Gre-
gorio 2016). The approach is based on the requirement for information about land
cover and its change over time, as both are essential input metrics to several SDG
targets (Fig. 13.3) and indicators (e.g. 6.6, 11.3.1, 15.2.1, 15.3.1). This information is
also useful to other national and international reporting requirements on the state of
the environment (e.g. United Nations Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation, Aichi
Targets, and the Paris Agreement).
13.4.1
DEA to Map Land Cover and Dynamics Over Time
The DEA land cover product has been optimized for high-performance computing
within the Open Data Cube (ODC) framework and is generating continental maps of
land-cover datasets from environmental variables (thematic and continuous), with a
13

focus on those that are generated at a national level within DEA’s ODC environment
(Lucas et al. 2019a) and for multiple points in time. These include the vegetation
cover fraction of the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (Gill et al. 2017),
Water Observations from Space (WOfS) (Mueller et al. 2016), surface reﬂectance
Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) (Roberts et al. 2018), and national mangrove
distribution (Lymburner et al. 2019) (Fig. 13.5). Additional layers generated through
DEA are also used (e.g., the InterTidal Elevation Model (ITEM) of Sagar et al.
(2017). The mapping is undertaken at 25 m resolution and the initial focus has been on
generatingland-coverclassiﬁcationsaccordingtotheLCCSLevel3taxonomy,which
differentiates 8 classes relating to aquatic and terrestrial (semi) natural vegetation,
cultivated and managed terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, artiﬁcial and natural (bare)
surfaces, and natural and artiﬁcial water bodies (Fig. 13.5 and Table 13.2). More
detailed classiﬁcations are being generated at what is termed Level 4 (e.g., vegetation
canopy cover and height, and water hydroperiod), which are further described using
Fig. 13.5 Examples of data inputs for the application of the FAO LCCS level 3 within Digital Earth

environmental variables that are external to the LCCS taxonomy (e.g., soil moisture
and crop type), examples of which are given in Fig. 13.6.
The availability of multi-temporal land-cover layers enables change matrices (e.g.
T1–Tbaseline) to be generated between land covers obtained for any two time-separated
periods. When only the LCCS Level 3 is considered, the temporal comparison
between two land-cover maps results in 64 different change categories (Fig. 13.7a).

Diagonal cells represent areas where the land cover (e.g. natural/semi-natural terres-
trial vegetation, natural water, artiﬁcial water, etc.) remains stable between the two
time periods and unique codes can be assigned for the From →To changes in land
cover. Figure 13.7b provides an example of a land-cover change matrix and map that
result from applying FAO LCCS level 3 on an inland water ecosystem in the State
of Queensland between two time periods.
One aspiration of DEA’s land cover product is to better inform management and
interventions in order to advance assessment and monitoring of progress towards the
SDGs at national levels. In this regard, research is being undertaken to concurrently
develop a change alert system (historically and when new data and data products
become available) that can associate changes in states (i.e., environmental variables)
with the causative mechanisms (i.e., human activities and climatic variability) and
the impacts that such changes produce (e.g. defoliation, land clearing, and increases
in built-up area). Such changes are based on evidence, and exploit a newly developed
change taxonomy (Lucas et al. 2019b). Geoscience Australia is extending the idea
to integrate, within DEA’s land cover product, EODESM with the Drivers-Pressure-
State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework (Lucas et al. 2019b; Metternicht et al.
2019). In doing so, links are—between economic and climate drivers and pressures of
change and detailed information on states, state changes and environmental impacts
(based on the change taxonomy). The drivers-pressure-state links can subsequently
inform impacts on management and policy (from local to international l-levels).
The ultimate ambition is to generate options for context-based policy and manage-
ment responses related to the SDGs (Fig. 13.8). Through this approach, responsible

authorities can make informed and timely decisions on interventions (e.g. manage-
ment decisions, new regulations).
As an illustration of the application of the integrated EODESM-DPSIR frame-
work, Fig. 13.9a shows the impact of rising sea levels (between 1991 and 2011)
on water and vegetation variables in Kakadu National Park, located in Australia’s
Northern Territory. An increase in water depth, salinity and hydroperiod and a cor-
responding rise in vegetation biomass, height and cover, along with an associated
transition from shrubs to trees (i.e., lifeform state change) was observed during this
period. Such changes might lead to an increase or a decrease in mangrove species.
In 2015, a substantive drop in sea level in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Duke et al. 2017)
was also noted in the Northern Territory (Lucas et al. 2018), which led to changes
in water conditions and a substantive dieback of mangroves. A loss of canopy cover
(%) and above-ground biomass (Mg ha−1) were the EO-derived state-change indi-
cators of short-term change; they were mapped through multi-temporal comparison
(2014–2016) of vegetation indices (primarily a Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI) and a Plant Senescence Reﬂectance Index (PSRI)) derived from Rapid-
Eyesatelliteimagery.Dieback-affectedmangroveswerenotremovedandtheirheight
(m) did not change (at least in the short term). A reduction in moisture content (%)
of woody vegetation was the proxy applied to differentiate dieback from defoliation
(Fig. 13.9b). Information on this proxy indicator can be discerned from, for example,
time series of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Figure 13.9 shows further aerial images of
sea-water encroachment along creeks and the associated colonization by mangroves
(9e), as well as mangrove dieback along the eastern and western shores of the West
Alligator River (9f).
The combination of the EODESM and DPSIR frameworks enables mapping of
where and how much change has occurred (extent and magnitude), the root causes
(sea-level change), and impacts (e.g., regrowth and dieback). Furthermore, likely
impacts on policy (e.g., the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change or the Convention on Biological Diversity) and land management (e.g.,
associated with Kakadu National Park) can be indicated and future interventions
suggested. In the case of SDG 6.6 (“By 2020, protect and restore water-related
ecosystems,includingmountains,forests,wetlands,rivers,aquifersandlakes”),main
policy actions to advance this target should address drivers of climate change (Met-
ternicht et al. 2018; Asbridge et al. 2018), including also environmental monitoring
through Digital Earth platforms (Lymburner et al. 2019).
Ongoing research is focusing on the use of DEA’s land cover product to derive
Australia-wide indicators for SDGs 6.6.1 (change in the extent of water-related
ecosystems over time), 11.3.1 (ratio of land consumption rate to population growth
rate), 15.1.1 (forest area as a proportion of total land area) and 15.3.1 (proportion of
land that is degraded compared to total land area). For example, the 2018 Australia
VNR mentions that the country is ‘exploring data sources’ for the implementation
of Indicator 15.3.1.
The following are examples of how multi-temporal land cover maps produced
within DEA using ARD satellite imagery (Landsat or Sentinel) and the combined

EODESMDPSIR framework could be used to derive metrics needed for baseline set-
ting, target setting and/or monitoring and reporting of SDG Target 15.3, which aims
‘to combat desertiﬁcation, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by
desertiﬁcation, drought and ﬂoods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral
world by 2030’.
13.4.2
DEA in Support of SDG Indicator 15.3.1
In the SDG Global Indicator Framework, indicator 15.3.1 “Proportion of land that
is degraded over total land area” is based on the analysis of available data for three
sub-indicators: land cover, land productivity and carbon stocks; this indicator takes
a binary form (degraded/not degraded). Computing SDG Indicator 15.3.1 for the
baseline (i.e., Tbaseline) and subsequent monitoring years (T1–Tn) requires adding
up all those areas where any changes in the sub-indicators (i.e. land cover, land
productivity and soil organic carbon) are considered negative (or stable if the baseline
or previous monitoring year labeled the area ‘degraded’) by national authorities. In
turn this involves:
i.
assessing the land cover and changes in land cover (i.e., trends)
ii.
analyzing the status of and trends in land productivity based on net primary
production
iii. determining carbon stock values and changes, with an initial assessment of soil
organic carbon as the proxy (Sims et al. 2017).
As a proxy for measuring progress towards SDG Target 15.3, indicator 15.3.1
presupposes that changes in land cover may point to land degradation if such change
implies a loss of ecosystem services considered desirable in a local or national con-
text. Hence, land cover information at the national level derived from a classiﬁcation
system such as the FAO LCCS can be used to assess and quantify land cover and
trends in land-cover change (Step i from above) by disaggregating the landscape into
‘degraded/negative/declining’, ‘stable/unchanging’ or ‘improving/positive’.
Based on the example presented in Fig. 13.10, the change matrix (containing 64
possible types of land change), obtained by comparing two satellite images from
two different periods classiﬁed using LCCS Level 3, can be translated into descrip-
tors relevant to SDG indicator 15.3.1. Changes indicative of land degradation can
be decided by individual countries, according to their national circumstances. In
Fig. 13.10, changes highlighted in orange (e.g., agricultural and urban expansion,
wetland drainage and vegetation loss) are considered examples of land degradation.
Diagonal cells in blue denote areas of no change (i.e., the land cover remained stable
between periods 1 and 2).3 Cells in green denote changes that the country would
3It is worth noting that land degradation can still occur within classes considered stable at LCCS
Level 3. For example, a landscape may remain classiﬁed as terrestrial semi-natural vegetation at
both T1–T2 even though a loss of canopy cover may have occurred. This is described at Level 4 of
the LCCS (as illustrated in Fig. 13.9).

Fig. 13.10 Example of deriving the sub-indicator ‘trend in land cover’ through a change matrix
that compares land-cover changes from time 1 to time 2. The land-cover layers are produced using
the FAO LCCS level 3 and EO ARD available within the DEA. Expert knowledge input is needed
to decide whether a change From To expresses an improvement (green cells), stability (blue cells),
or degradation (orange cells)
consider to correspond to a decrease in degraded areas (i.e., an improvement) as a
consequence of, for instance, sustainable land-management interventions that were
made during the time period T1–T2. Figure 13.10b shows the output of this EO-based
mapping process, summarizing the number of hectares of land that remained stable,
were improved or have been degraded further between T1 and T2. This output can
then be overlain and integrated with national information on land productivity status
and trends, as well as soil organic carbon stocks, as suggested by the GIF metadata
and good practice guidance for Indicator 15.3.1 (Sims et al. 2017).
Although it is still at the proof-of-concept stage, these applications show the poten-
tial of Digital Earth to assist countries in meeting several of the SDGs (particularly
6.6, 13, 14, and 15) where land cover and its change dynamics are relevant to report-
ing on the approved indicator (metric), tracking progress towards their attainment
by 2030, helping to set targets according to national circumstances, and importantly,
setting baselines. The baseline year for the SDG indicators is 2015 and for those
related to land, its value (t0) should be derived from time-series data for the period
462
G. Metternicht et al.
2000–2015. The retrospective capacity of data provision by EO provides a unique
comparative advantage to the achievement of this ambition.
13.4.3
Digital Earth in Support of SDG 17: Strengthen
Means of Implementation
DEA is an example of big Earth data contributing to SDG 17 in aspects such as
multi-stakeholder partnership, and production of data and systems for monitoring
and accountability, and is also enhancing capacity-building support to developing
and least-developed countries. The capabilities of the ODC to provide EO ARD and
for scaling out across the world are signiﬁcant contributions to Goal 17 in terms
of strengthening means of implementation through technology transfer, capacity
building and data, and monitoring and accountability.
The technology that lies beneath DEA, which was pioneered by Geoscience
Australia, The Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation, and
Australia’s National Computational Infrastructure, underpins ODC initiatives being
rolled out in developed (e.g. Switzerland) as well as developing countries (e.g. Viet-
nam) and regions (e.g. Digital Earth Africa: DEAfrica). DEAfrica is an example of
Australia fulﬁlling Goal 17’s aim of strengthening the means of implementation, as
it builds technical and policy expertise as well as data analysis capability in-country
with technical and operational guidance from DEA. A public–private investment
partnership will provide continuing investment for DEAfrica, and it is envisaged
that analysis, products and tools produced by DEAfrica will be accessible across the
continent to inform decisions about land and water.
13.4.4
The Way Forward: Partnerships to Strengthen DEA
in Support of the SDGs
The Australian Bureau of Statistics and other lead agencies (e.g. Department of
Environment and Energy) that have contributed to the development of the Australian
Reporting Platform (Fig. 13.11) recognize the importance of partnerships and col-
laboration with data providers for collecting datasets relevant to the SDG indicator
framework. Big Earth data is needed to track the progress of Australia’s performance
on the goals and set targets, in addition to reporting to the United Nations High-Level
Political Forum on the SDG Indicators Framework. Multi-source, multi-temporal
data covering the socio-economic and environmental pillars of sustainable develop-
ment can also assist in identifying interlinkages, overlaps and interactions between
the SDGs, a key issue in the development of coherent policies and interventions, as
discussed in Sect. 13.1.

Fig. 13.11 The Australian Government’s Reporting Platform for the SDGs adopts a participatory,
whole-government approach
As progress is made on identifying datasets and on reﬁning the SDG Indicators,
particularly as they move from Tier III to Tier I or II, additional datasets will be
uploaded to the platform, offering new data for indicator metrics and enabling the
development of time-series of datasets. The government plans that the platform can
assist in streamlining reporting for other nationally and internationally agreed goals
(e.g. Aichi Targets, Sendai Framework, and implementation of the System of Envi-
ronmental Economic Accounts (SEEA) framework). In keeping with the intention of
the SDG indicator framework, the ofﬁcial GIF may be complemented by SDG indi-
cators that are relevant at the regional and national levels (Australian Government
2018).

Big Earth Data for the SDG: Prospects
Measuring progress for the SDG targets through the Global Indicator Framework
requires metrics that rely on biophysical, social, and economic data and information.
This chapter has reviewed the current role of Digital Earth (EO as a sub-set of big
Earth data) in the SDGs. It can be seen that progress has been made on identify-
ing EO data and information for the SDG GIF (Sect. 13.3), and that participatory,
cross-institutionalapproachesdevelopedundera“DigitalEarth”umbrellacandeliver
operational, standardized information that contributes to baseline and target setting,
and to tracking progress towards the SDGs (4). Opportunities, and associated chal-
lenges, exist in relation to the realization of the full potential of DE for the SDG. This
ﬁnal section identiﬁes and discusses these in terms of three main aspects: research
and development (R&D) and technology; governance, institutional and normative
aspects; and the science-policy interface.
13.5.1
R&D and Technology
Social sensing and other big data integrated within DE have the potential to meet cur-
rent information and knowledge gaps for SDG indicators focused on socio-economic
information (e.g. zero hunger, good health and well-being, and gender equality). Plag
and Jules-Plag (2019) and Dong et al. (2019) conclude that new geospatial informa-
tion for sustainability (e.g. on the built environment, land use and management),
could be derived from the integration of traditional EO approaches to data gathering
with citizen science, crowd-sourcing, social sensing, big data analytics and the Inter-
net of Things. Hence, further research is needed to better establish how countries
can proﬁt from these new technologies for data gathering and analysis, embedded in
a DE framework, and advance the development of indicators complementary to the
core of the SDG GIF. This can support country-based interpretation and better, more
coherent, narratives of national progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development (Metternicht et al. 2019).
Information on the use and management of land rather than land cover is needed
for many SDGs (see Sect. 13.3 and Wunder et al. 2018); hence, it is relevant and
pertinent to develop ‘Essential Land Variables’ or ‘Essential Land Use Variables’ to
better support the information needs of the SDG targets and indicators. Digital Earth
data, technology and analytics can underpin primary observations of the changes in
state of land-related variables (Dong et al. 2019), with the potential to be linked to
state-change indicators or to the pressures driving changes in state (see Sect. 13.4 and
Lucas et al. 2019b), thus contributing to tracking progress on SDG implementation.
Recent research (Plag and Jules-Plag 2019; Masó et al. 2019) has put forward ways
of improving the current SDG indicator framework through considering Essential
Variables. The Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and major international networks
such as the Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO-BON) and the Global Ocean
13
Digital Earth for Sustainable Development Goals
465
Observing System (GOOS) have developed essential variables on climate (ECVs),
oceans (EOVs), the water cycle (EWVs), and biodiversity (EBVs). However, stan-
dardized essential variables related to land (ELV) (or land use: ELUVs) are lacking.
Global programs (e.g., Future Earth’s GLP4) and EU-funded initiatives (e.g., the
GEOEssential, ERA-PLANET5 and ConnectinGEO projects) have started discus-
sions on the design and development of essential land variables; the research of
Reyes et al. (2017), Masó et al. (2019), Lehmann et al. (2019), Nativi et al. (2019),
and Plag and Jules-Plag (2019) provide the conceptual principles and the information
needs that these variables should fulﬁl in order to address current SDG policy and
the knowledge needs of indicators. A constellation of Essential Variables on land
cover/use, agriculture, biodiversity, water, and climate could better support imple-
mentation of the SDGs and the associated GIF, and also underpin systematic gen-
eration of sustainability-related knowledge from big Earth data. This would beneﬁt
Agenda 2030’s global-change policy, as well as other major international agreements
and conventions (e.g. the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the
Paris Agreement on Climate Change).
13.5.2
Normativity, Governance and Institutional
Arrangements
Google Earth Engine and Amazon Cloud-based Web Services are among cutting
edge initiatives providing efﬁcient solutions that lower the barriers to ARD products.
These allow users to concentrate on data analysis and interpretation for better use
of the growing volume of EO data (Giuliani et al. 2017), and expand the ecosys-
tem of ‘next users’ beyond specialized scientiﬁc communities. While this is a key
requirement for unlocking the informational power of big EO data and expanding the
number of potential EO data users, it presents normative and governance challenges
concerning big data veracity (Dong et al. 2019). Lowering access barriers for data
analytics by users beyond the scientiﬁc community could potentially deliver low-
quality information products. In this regard, the DE community needs to expand and
build upon existing norms, standards and guidelines that have been advanced in the
context of EO data storage and processing (see Sudmanns et al. 2019) to include data
validation and quality assurance for information products. For example, Hernandez
(2017) postulates that Digital Earth will need to consider how to store the proper
metadata so that any user can easily understand how accurate data are, and how the
quality of the data has been evaluated or validated. More to the point, he argues for
adequate e-infrastructure and standards.

G. Metternicht et al.
Normative challenges also remain regarding how best to determine the quality and
veracity of big data from a statistical perspective (e.g., ethical questions regarding
ownership of data and products). What is legally, ethically and culturally acceptable
for accessing and using big data? What should the governance of digital reposito-
ries, particularly those hosting globalized or multi-national big data sets, look like?
MacFeely (2019) rightly reﬂects that “open cloud, centralised statistical production
rather than replicating many times in countries is tempting, though it faces chal-
lenges of data and information sovereignty, as it places data owners and the data
themselves beyond the reach of national level systems”.
Institutional adaptation for transformative data and information acquisition is
needed as well. National Statistical Ofﬁces (NSOs) are tasked with assembling rele-
vant data for national voluntary reports on the SDGs. The big Earth data community
needs to understand how best to engage with this community to develop metrics
derived from EO data that can be used for reporting. Soulard and Grenier (2018)
summarize the challenges of using EO data for ofﬁcial statistics. Among the most
salient are that datasets created from EO were not designed for use as ofﬁcial statis-
tics. For integration of the EO datasets, and to better exploit the potential of big
Earth data, Soulard and Grenier argue that NSOs need to develop methodologies to
properly interpret existing datasets to provide estimates required by ofﬁcial statistics;
evaluate the pertinence of global datasets that are often designed without regional
considerations; keep up with the ever-increasing number of EO-generated datasets;
adjust the national or regional data where local data of better quality highlight impor-
tant shortcomings in the national or regional dataset; evaluate the complementarity
of using EO data where other data often does not exist; and inﬂuence EO producers
to integrate ofﬁcial statistical objectives into the EO processing workﬂow from the
beginning. It is a two-way communication process.
13.5.3
Science-Policy Interface
Operationalization of big Earth Data proof-of-concepts is relevant to the scientiﬁc
support for sustainable development policy strategies that are coordinated and coher-
ent across goals. Reﬂecting on the status of operationalization of big data for SDGs
from the perspective of NSOs, MacFeely (2019) argues that “Advances, such as, the
Internet of Things and biometrics will all surely present opportunities to compile
new and useful statistics. The implications of this ‘big (data) bang’ for statistics in
general, and the SDGs in particular, is not immediately clear, but one can envisage
a whole host of new ways to measure and understand the human condition and the
progress of development”. The UN Economic Commission for Europe (2016) reﬂect-
ing on their experiences, noted ‘High initial expectations about the opportunities of
Big Data had to face the complexity of reality. The fact that data are produced in
large amounts does not mean they are immediately and easily available for producing
statistics’. Simply put, the interface between science and policy needs enhancement
for context-based interpretation and communication as discussed below.
13
Digital Earth for Sustainable Development Goals
467
The implementation of ‘transformational’ policies and strategies for achieving
the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires tracking the
progress of set targets to ensure that responses to interventions (e.g., land restoration
or sustainable cities) are as expected. In this regard, a major challenge of Digital
Earth is the linking of scientiﬁc results concerning knowledge derived from EO to the
policydecisionspace.Ontheonehand,multi-stake,whole-government,participatory
processes, as implemented by the Government of Australia in setting its National
Reporting Platform (see 4.1 and 4.4), contribute to bridging the gap between science
and policy. On the other hand, DE frameworks more focused on the ‘knowledge’
elementoftheData-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom(DIKW)paradigmareneeded.
SDG indicators should provide policy makers with the knowledge necessary for wise
decisions, drawn from information gathered from observed data, whether through
EO, social sensing, or other means. (Nativi et al. 2019). Most DE initiatives currently
focus on ‘Data’ (i.e., ARD) as shown in the review by Sudmanns et al. (2019) of
popular systems and portals for accessing or processing EO. This review makes clear
that many portals facilitate data access—although in the end users struggle to produce
information and ‘frame’ it according to context. This is an essential aspect of the
policy and political decision-making processes related to the implementation of the
SDGs, given that countries are to take into account their own national circumstances
and priorities (UNGA 2015) in deﬁning SDG targets and, hence, one-size-ﬁts-all
interventions do not exist.
13.6
Conclusion
The Sustainable Development Goals are highly ambitious and were adopted to stim-
ulate action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for humanity and
the planet (UNGA 2015). Digital Earth has untapped potential to improve the means
of implementing the SDGs at both national and global scales. Through an exten-
sive review of the recent literature and a case study of the operationalization of the
SDG Indicator Framework in Australia, this chapter discussed information needs and
promising operational initiatives underpinned by big Earth data and analytics, and,
as importantly, multi-stakeholder partnerships. Digital Earth Australia is an example
of the potential of Digital Earth to be an agent of ‘partnerships for the goals’, which
can increase the availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data that is relevant in
national contexts (SDG 17.18), and enhance regional and international cooperation
on, and access to, science, technology and innovation (SDG17.6).

Abstract Our planet is undergoing one of the most rapid climate changes in Earth’s
history. The current change is particularly signiﬁcant because it is most likely a conse-
quence of human activities since the 19th century. The Digital Earth platform, which
includes Earth-orbiting satellites, ground-based observations, and other technologies
for collecting, analyzing and visualizing data, has enabled scientists to see our cli-
mate and its impacts at regional and global scales. The Digital Earth platform offers
valuable information on the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and cryosphere to
understand Earth’s past and present, and it supports Earth system models for cli-
mate prediction and projection. This chapter gives an overview of the advances in
climate change studies based on Digital Earth and provides case studies that utilize
Digital Earth in climate change research, such as in the observation of sensitive fac-
tors for climate change, global environmental change information and simulation
systems, and synchronous satellite-aerial-ground observation experiments, which
provide extremely large and abundant datasets. The mapping of climate extremes
and impacts improves preparedness for climate change-related risks and provides
robust evidence to support climate risk management and climate change adaptation
for the public, decision makers, investors, and vulnerable communities. However,
Digital Earth faces the challenges of multisource data coordination and integration,
requiring international partnerships between governments and other organizations to
advance open data policies and practices.

Introduction
Global climate change has long been recognized as the most critical issue of the 21st
century. The 2016 Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Conven-
tion on Climate Change (UNFCCC) highlights the importance and urgency of climate
action. Climate-related changes are becoming evident at various spatial and temporal
scales, accompanied by a record increase in the frequency of extreme climate events
and the emergence of complex environmental issues. As a result, vulnerability to cli-
mate change is expected to expand spatially, threatening larger human populations
as warming continues. Understanding climate change and delivering climate infor-
mation with high precision has therefore become increasingly important, especially
to assist governments and decision makers in implementing appropriate mitigation
and adaptation policies.
The Earth system is a complex collection of interlinked subsystems that require
multidimensional, multiscale and multitemporal datasets. Understandably, chal-
lenges and uncertainties in studying climate change and its impacts are largely due to
the massive amount of data that is required, and the complexity of analyses that can
translate data into useful information. Earth observation for this purpose has become
an invaluable resource. Earth observations, during most of the history of science,
have predominantly been recorded at the ground level with limited spatial coverage.
Methods such as those developed by World Weather Watch in 1963 combined a
series of single surface pictures to provide global coverage but lacked network den-
sity and vertical resolution. Geophysical and biological phenomena have also been
generally insufﬁciently sampled. However, the growing diversity and improvement
of sensors and sensing platforms has greatly diversiﬁed data sources, beneﬁting
global climate change research in the past few decades through technologies that
can increasingly provide a more accurate and precise picture of biological, phys-
ical, and chemical phenomena (Table 14.1). Moreover, satellite platforms and the
development of UAVs and other technologies have made multitemporal observa-
tions feasible, which have allowed for investigations into large-scale processes that
were traditionally not possible. Synoptic Earth observations have changed the way
we understand the planet, from the ﬁrst weather satellite that revealed astonishing
cloud features to their utility to verify and improve our understanding of the coupling
between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and ocean currents. They have been used
to study temperatures at various altitudes, atmospheric processes, the effects of snow
on water circulation, the effects of global and regional factors on sea level changes,
and other phenomena. From 1960 to 2011, 514 Earth observation satellites were
launched worldwide, and 200 more launches are planned by 2030 (Guo 2014). The
huge amount of data collected over the years provides a rich resource of information
for climate change research. However, this big data presents challenges in data col-
lection, characterization and analysis. Therefore, there is urgent need for a Digital
Earth platform that can integrate multisource spatial information into a single plat-
form and allow for integrated investigation into Earth observation data to generate
climate change information.

Digital Earth and the Essential Climate Variables
Climate change is highly heterogeneous over the globe, with strong regionality. The
UNFCCC provides 34 essential climate variables (ECVs) that require contributions
from Earth observations from space (Table 14.2) (Guo et al. 2015). The spatial
attributes of ECVs make it possible to effectively observe them through space tech-
nology (Guo et al. 2014a), and the Digital Earth platform based on space technology
plays an essential role in better understanding the spatial and temporal changes in
the climate.

14.2.1
Earth Observation Data Parameters and Their
Capabilities
Ground-based Earth observation systems such as rain gauge networks and radar have
always been a major means of observing atmospheric structures and they are still
being operated and maintained. However, satellite platforms have added valuable sci-
entiﬁc data to monitor clouds, water vapor, precipitation, and wind at multiple spatial
and temporal scales. Sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiome-
ter (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) devel-
oped by the U.S., the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) from the
European Space Agency (ESA), and the international A-Train satellite systems have
provided a wealth of information on clouds, rain, and pollutants, leading to a greater
understanding of cloud pollution inﬂuences (Guo et al. 2015).
The cryosphere, consisting of lakes, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps,
and frozen ground (including permafrost), is one of the most important parts of
the climate system. Thus, changes in the cryosphere as well as in soil moisture
and salinity are very important for monitoring global climate change, managing
regional water resources, and investigating water and land ecosystems and global sea
levels. Data from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites (carrying visible/near-
infrared sensors), such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
System (GOES), Landsat, MODIS, MERIS, and AVHRR, have been used to monitor
14

the melt ﬂow from snow cover and glaciers. This information is also valuable for the
management of water resources and disasters, and has been utilized for ﬂood disaster
prediction and reservoir operation. Data from the Sea Winds scatterometers onboard
the QuikSCAT satellites can monitor seasonal changes in ice, track giant icebergs,
and provide daily maps of ocean ice at a 6-km resolution.
Earth observation satellites also provide hundreds of data products (Table 14.3) to
monitor water quality, water color (e.g., chlorophyll, suspended solids, and turbid-
ity) and sea surface temperatures. For example, the AVHRR, AATSR, and MODIS
sensors provide data on sea surface temperatures (CEOS 2006; Guo et al. 2015). In
addition, many satellites can obtain data on elevation measurements, geopotential
heights, and terrain. For example, P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can pen-
etrate cloud cover and the vegetation canopy and is useful in tropical and northern
forest research at high altitudes. Improved SAR such as advanced synthetic aperture
radar (ASAR) and phased array L-band SAR (PALSAR) are available for agriculture,
forestry, land cover classiﬁcation, hydrology, and cartography.
The main characteristics of climate change are the trends in temperature, pre-
cipitation, polar ice cover, and sea level. A new generation of satellite systems and
advanced sensors such as Suomi NPP, GPM, OSTM/Jason-2, ICESat-2, and SWOT

have further improved our capability for space-based observation of these key param-
eters related to climate change. In addition to the space-based data, in situ data from
ground measurements and reanalysis data are used to provide information on key
indicators of climate change. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) com-
piles all the information obtained by the Copernicus environmental satellites, air and
ground stations, and sensors to provide comprehensive pictures of the past, present,
and future climate of Earth.
14.2.2
Heterogeneous Changes in Temperature
Heatwaves and rising temperatures have gained prominence in the context of global
warming. Digital Earthtechnologyis relativelymaturefor monitoringglobal landand
sea surface temperatures, although the algorithms and retrieval accuracy need to be
further improved, and satellite LST measurements have uncertainties caused by data
accuracy and inconsistencies between sensors. Nevertheless, satellite measurements
have been very useful in monitoring surface temperatures and detecting extreme
temperature events.
Thermal infrared surface temperatures from satellite platforms are frequently inte-
grated into data assimilation systems and reanalysis data systems for climate param-
eters, including NCEP/NCAR and NCEP/DOE, ERA-40, and JRA-25, which effec-
tively improves the accuracy and reliability of datasets. The most widely used global
land surface temperature datasets are the monthly data measured by the AVHRR
thermal infrared band (4, 5) since 1982, the 8-day composite data derived from
the MODIS thermal infrared band since 2000, the daily global LST and SST data
provided by ENVISAT from the ESA, and the LST measured by Aster at small
scales. The geostationary satellite system operated by the United States, Europe,
China, Japan, and others provide low- and middle-latitude LST data at one-minute
intervals. In addition, SeaWiFS, FY-2/4 and FY-3 can acquire LST data. The Suomi
NPP satellite launched in 2012 carries a 750-meter spatial resolution Visible Infrared
Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor, and its surface temperature data quality
was an improvement (Guillevic et al. 2014).
The monitoring and impact assessment of heat waves based on multisource ther-
mal infrared remote sensing data have made important progress in recent years. Since
the heat wave in central Europe in 2003, most large-scale heat wave events have been
successfully monitored, including the large-area heat wave in southern Asia in the
summer of 2010, the continued high-temperature anomaly in eastern Asia during
the spring of 2013, the extreme low-temperature event that lasted several weeks in
central and eastern North America in the winter of 2014, and the persistent heat wave
that swept over southern Asia and western Europe in the spring and summer of 2015.
Progressive improvement of Digital Earth’s thermal environment platform that inte-
grates multisensor and multiresolution spatial data can provide automatic and more
accurate extreme temperature information, and support government decision making
and public information services.

14.2.3
Heterogeneous Changes in Precipitation
The accuracy of precipitation estimation has improved over the years with satellite-
based sensors. Satellite systems allow for continual monitoring and observation of
precipitation on a global scale, which was only possible at ﬁxed intervals with lim-
ited spatial coverage using conventional ground-based observation systems. Infrared
sensors onboard geostationary satellites, passive microwave sensors carried by the
polar-orbiting satellites, and active radar onboard the TRMM satellite and its suc-
cessors have collected a huge wealth of data on precipitation over the years. The
establishment of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) realized a satellite con-
stellation with coordinated, seamless observation of global precipitation, indicating
a new era of “digital precipitation”. GPM is an independent and complex project
consisting of a core satellite and approximately eight other satellites. Its precipita-
tion observation can reach a radius of 5 km, covering 90% of the global land and
ocean surface at three-hour intervals, and can distinguish rainfall, snow, ice and
other precipitation forms. It is much more advanced than the previous generation of
TRMM.
Geostationary meteorological satellites such as FY-2, GOES, GMS, Meteosat,
and MTSAT have seen improvements in multichannel scanning and real-time per-
formance and have high spatial and temporal resolutions (from one-hour intervals
to half-hour intensive observation, and 5-km and 1.25-km spatial resolution at nadir
for the infrared and visible and near-infrared spectral channels, respectively). This
makes them more effective in monitoring hazardous weather systems. Therefore,
comprehensive application of multiple channels such as thermal infrared, visible
light, near-infrared, and water vapor channels is an essential component of the Dig-
ital Earth platform for extreme precipitation monitoring.
14.2.4
Extreme Climate Events
Extreme climate events refer to serious deviation of the climate from its average
state, including phenomena that are statistically less signiﬁcant. Extreme climate
events generally include high-temperature heat waves, extreme snow, strong tropical
storms, ﬂoods, meteorological droughts, and natural ﬁres. Space-based observation
ofextremeclimateeventsconsistsofreal-timewarningandmonitoring,rapidpostdis-
aster assessment, and disaster risk reduction. This requires high spatial and temporal
resolution satellite information and an efﬁcient operational platform. This is both a
challenge and an opportunity for Digital Earth. For instance, regarding disaster risk,
the combination of multisource satellite data, land use data, and topographic data
makes it possible to rapidly assess ﬂood risk at the watershed and regional scales
(Reager et al. 2014). Cold winter events have occurred frequently in Eurasia in the
last 10 years, and extreme low temperatures have been record-breaking. Mori et al.
480
G. Jia et al.
(2014) added Arctic sea ice data and SST to climate models and found that the reason
for most cold winters is Arctic Oscillation (AO).
Digital Earth technology has shown great potential in disaster monitoring, emer-
gency response, disaster assessment, and reconstruction. Disaster reduction is the
most effective aspect of the Digital Earth platform, which can perform all-weather,
all-day dynamic detection. Meteorological satellites, radar satellites, and high-
resolutionvisibleandnear-infraredEarthobservationsatellitescanbeusedtomonitor
rainfall, ﬂoods, and droughts in real time for emergency response. The Digital Earth
platform can support rapid analysis of the statistics and distribution of ﬂooded areas,
ﬂooded land use categories, and the number of people affected, especially when
satellite data is combined with digital thematic maps such as administrative, land
use, population, and socioeconomic maps.
14.3
Interactions Between Climate and Society Through
Space and Time
14.3.1
Greenhouse Gas Exchange
The current global climate change is mainly attributed to rapidly increasing atmo-
spheric concentrations of two greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
(CH4). Most of the body of research on greenhouse gases has focused on CO2 rather
than CH4, which is a more potent greenhouse gas. The lack of high spatial and
temporal resolution datasets on continuous ﬂux is a major reason for the limited
knowledge on CH4 exchange (Holgerson and Raymond 2016). In the case of CO2,
the scientiﬁc community still lacks a detailed understanding. For example, according
to existing ground measurements, 40–50% of the carbon dioxide produced by human
activities remains in Earth’s atmosphere, and the remaining 50–60% is considered
to be absorbed by the ocean and ground vegetation. However, scientists do not know
exactly where the carbon dioxide is stored, how this storage process occurs, and
whether this process can limit the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To
date, spatiotemporal pattern studies of terrestrial carbon sources and carbon sinks
based on space technology have been mainly achieved through satellite-based visible
light and near-infrared band indexes. The 8-km inverted AVHRR continuous vege-
tation index data is the longest time series, since 1982, and the accuracy of the sixth
generation of the MODIS (C6) vegetation index data has been greatly improved. In
addition, Landsat, MERIS, VIIRS, SPOT Vegetation, and Sea-Viewing Wide Field-
of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) data are available.
A key parameter for monitoring the temporal and spatial patterns of terrestrial
carbon sources and carbon sinks is the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active
radiation (FAPAR), which largely determines the total gross primary production
(GPP) or carbon assimilation capacity. To date, more than six different global FAPAR
spatial databases have been released, inverted from MODIS, MERIS, SeaWiFS,
14
Digital Earth for Climate Change Research
481
MODIS-TIP, SPOT-VEG, and AVHRR time series data; however, the data are highly
uncertain. A systematic evaluation of more than 800 ground sample datasets revealed
that they differed greatly between continents and biomes, and all were insensitive
to vegetation coverage and needed further improvement (Pickett-Heaps et al. 2014).
Chinese scholars have made costrengthening observations among 25 ﬁeld ﬂux sta-
tions and driven vegetation productivity models with ﬂux data, satellite-based veg-
etation indexes, surface albedo, and soil moisture indexes, which have signiﬁcantly
improved the estimation of FAPAR and GPP on a regional scale (Wang et al. 2010).
A recent improvement was the use of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence data from the GOME
satellite to drive vegetation productivity models and monitor global crop photosyn-
thesis (Guanter et al. 2014).
The Orbital Carbon Observing Satellite (OCO-2) is a satellite launched by the
United States in 2014 to monitor the global space-time distribution of carbon diox-
ide. It is mainly used to observe the carbon dioxide level of the Earth’s atmosphere
and to understand the role of humans in global climate changes caused by green-
house gas emissions. The satellite carries a three-channel spectrometer for accurate
measurements. OCO-2 collects approximately 8 million accurate global carbon diox-
ide measurements every 16 days, with a measurement accuracy of one in a million.
With instruments such as spectrometers carried on satellites, scientists can dynami-
cally measure carbon dioxide from different sources in the atmosphere and monitor
the adsorption of carbon dioxide by oceans and forests. The acquisition of such a
dynamic global carbon dioxide map will help reduce errors and improve the accuracy
of forecasts for global warming.
Prior to this, in 2009, JAXA (Japan) launched GOSAT, the ﬁrst satellite dedicated
to detecting the concentration of greenhouse gases such as atmospheric CO2. The
satellite was equipped with high-precision observation equipment that used green-
house gases such as carbon dioxide and methane to absorb infrared rays of a speciﬁc
wavelength, and estimated the concentration of greenhouse gases by observing the
infrared rays reﬂected from the surface. The goal of GOSAT was to observe the
distribution of global CO2 and CH4, with a measurement precision of 2–3 ppm for
CO2 and approximately 15 ppb for CH4, to capture the spatial variation in the carbon
ﬂux each year. GOSAT was equipped with thermal infrared and near-infrared sensors
to obtain carbon observations as well as cloud and aerosol images. As the infrared
rays passes through the atmosphere, a gas that forms a greenhouse effect, such as
carbon dioxide, causes a speciﬁc wavelength to be absorbed, and the concentration
of the gas can be calculated from these data. TanSat, launched by China, has further
improved our ability to detect atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
Many countries including China are actively planning to launch satellites for the
special detection of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Integrating spatial
data from these different sources with station observation data on the Digital Earth
platform will greatly enhance the accuracy of detection and the technical support for
climate change research.

14.3.2
Connectivity and Teleconnection in the Earth System
The Earth system as a whole, its components, and the various regional subsystems are
connected and closely related. For example, in ocean-air interactions, the transfer
of energy between the two is a teleconnection. We are gradually recognizing the
importance of teleconnections in the climate system. For example, variability in the
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) model across the equatorial Paciﬁc is linked to
widespread distribution of ﬂoods, droughts, and forest ﬁres in often arid or semiarid
areas such as East Africa, tropical and subtropical Australia, and North America
within the mid-latitudes and the western coast of South America. Another good
example comes from Mori et al. (2014), who showed that most cold winters are
attributed to AO changes caused by Arctic sea ice.
Studying and understanding teleconnections is an important challenge and an
undertaking that can greatly beneﬁt from utilization of the Digital Earth platform’s
capabilities of macroscopic multiparameter data integration to enable discovery of
hidden and underlying connections in the Earth system and reveal the mechanisms to
improve predictions of climate and weather. Various aspects remain to be identiﬁed
and can beneﬁt from the Digital Earth platform. For example, regarding ENSO and
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), we know relatively little about the teleconnec-
tion between the stratosphere and the Earth’s surface. A strong vortex is formed over
the polar region in winter, and the vortex intensity changes. When the vortex is strong,
a tightly stable cycle is concentrated in the stratosphere, with little connection to the
troposphere and the Earth’s surface. When the vortex is weak, the control is not very
stable, and it can generate a large-scale dynamic process. Therefore, it can be trans-
mitted to the surface of the Earth through the convective top layer. It causes unusually
cold weather at high latitudes, for example, in Scandinavia. When the Arctic vortex
weakens, cold air ﬂows outwards and downwards. Another example is the study by
Zhang et al. (2019), which showed that the mean winter visibility throughout most
of eastern China is negatively correlated with the preceding Antarctic Oscillation
(AAO), especially in northern China. It emphasizes the important roles of sea sur-
face temperature warming or cooling tendencies in the northwestern southern Indian
Ocean (NSIO) and provides possible pathways through which NSIO warming may
inﬂuence the atmosphere of northern China.
14.4
Impacts and Response
14.4.1
Ecosystems
Currently, the spatial data used to analyze the response of large-scale ecosystems to
climate change are mainly acquired from long-term time series data from medium-
and coarse-resolution optical satellite sensors such as AVHRR, MODIS, SPOT,
VIIRS, SeaWiFS, and MERIS, which have inconsistencies between the sensors and
14
Digital Earth for Climate Change Research
483
their time spans (Guay et al. 2014). Several released global data series are generally
basedontherecordsofasinglesensor.Therearefewdataseriesfrommultisourcedata
fusion and integration. However, satellite data often contain uncertainties caused by
biases in different sensors and retrieval algorithms as well as inconsistencies between
continuing satellite missions with the same sensor. Undetected drifts in sensor sen-
sitivity have been cited as the main reason for the apparent spectrum of change. If
the procedures for merging data from different time series are not well-developed
and calibrated, the uncertainties can potentially be high in combined datasets. An
integrated vegetation index dataset based on system calibration and data fusion is an
important requirement for the Digital Earth platform.
Due to the complexity of ecosystem dynamics in the context of climate change,
traditional methods based on single-satellite data have great limitations. By inte-
grating and comparing multiple satellite datasets and ground observation data, the
Digital Earth platform can dynamically and effectively display and analyze the trends
of climate-related parameters.
14.4.2
Water Cycle and Water Resources
The global water cycle involves transformation, ﬂow, and redistribution, and the
redistribution of global and regional energy and regulation of the climate. The Earth
observation system can quantitatively monitor many key parameters of the global
water cycle, including various forms of precipitation (such as rainfall, hailstones, ice
rain, and snow), atmospheric water vapor, surface evaporation, vegetation canopy
transpiration, surface water, snow, continental glaciers, sea ice, soil moisture, and
surface runoff.
Using the Digital Earth platform, global hydrology cycle models can be devel-
oped to reveal the controlling factors of terrestrial water cycling and trends in water
resource patterns. It is expected to lead to a revolutionary solution to a series of key
issues in Earth’s multiple spheres of interactions from the perspective of Earth system
dynamics, including global ocean-atmospheric interaction, land-atmospheric inter-
action and the boundary layer process, ocean-land correlation, and coastal ecosystem
evolution.
14.4.3
Coastline, Urban Areas, and Infrastructure
Smajgl et al. (2015) employed remote sensing land use data, digital elevation data,
and high-resolution climate models to simulate the scenario of a regional sea level
rise of 30 cm by 2050. The study predicted that urban ﬂoods and sea water backﬂow
would be severe downstream of the Greater Mekong Subregion and that the land use
structure would change signiﬁcantly.
484
G. Jia et al.
The urban heat island effect accompanies the expansion of human settlements and
is closely related to regional climate change. As the most active region of economic
growth and urbanization, the urban heat island phenomenon in Asia, especially in
China, has become an important issue in regional climate change. The Digital Earth
system provides comprehensive spatial information about urban areas (Hu et al.
2015), human activity intensity (Zhou et al. 2014), and thermal infrared land surface
temperature. It provides a scientiﬁc platform for research on urban heat islands
at different spatial and temporal scales. Regarding the potential contributions of
infrastructure to a warming climate, researchers have examined the impacts of urban
expansion on the trends in air temperature by investigating the changes in urban land
use around meteorological stations and analyzing the relationship between the rate
of urban expansion and air temperature magnitudes (He et al. 2013). Urban heat
islands can inﬂuence land-atmospheric energy exchange, the turbulence regime of
atmospheric ﬂow, and the microclimate, and can accordingly modify the boundary
layer processes over urban canopy and downstream areas. Research showed that
estimation of key urban morphology parameters using high- and medium-resolution
satellite data and intense ﬁeld measurement along urban-rural transects can improve
the performance of regional climate models in capturing critical climate effects over
large and rapidly expanding urban clusters (Jia et al. 2015; Feng et al. 2014; Wang
et al. 2012).
14.5
Multisource Digital Earth for Studying Climate
Change Phenomena
Earth is a large, complex system, broadly grouped into three subsystems: the atmo-
sphere, oceans, and land surface. Climate change involves understanding changes in
one of these subsystems and understanding how these systems interact, their impacts
on one another, and the consequences of changes in any one of them or their sub-
systems. This requires rich scientiﬁc datasets quantifying sensitive climate factors,
which is not possible without integration of data from multiple sources. These mul-
tisource datasets have been collected over the years through synchronous satellite-
aerial-ground observation experiments (Fig. 14.1).
Multisource datasets allow for comprehensive, continuous, and diverse informa-
tion on the Earth’s surface. Similarly, multisensor remote sensing datasets enable
dynamic (and in some cases real-time or near real-time) monitoring of Earth’s sys-
tems. It has played a fundamental role in supporting modern data-driven scientiﬁc
innovation. Effective use of multiplatform Earth observation data with multiple sen-
sors helps avoid and mitigate issues related to information extraction and inversions
that arise from the use of a single sensor.
These datasets have enabled researchers to explore new theories by devel-
oping new methodologies and assimilation models that can incorporate multi-
source/multisensor, heterogeneous spatial data to acquire precise information on

Plateau (revised from Guo et al. 2015)
sensitive climate factors and develop simulation platforms to understand regional
climate change patterns. Multisensor Earth observations also provide long-term,
stable spatial data for scientiﬁc research, compensating for uneven spatiotemporal
observations, and play a fundamental supporting role in global change research.
The National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) launched the
project “Earth Observation for Sensitive Variables of Global Change: Mechanisms
and Methodologies” on January 1, 2009. This was the ﬁrst research project on Earth
observation techniques for global change research in China. The project highlighted
sensitive variables in terrestrial, oceanic and atmospheric systems based on big data
from Earth observation from multiple platforms and multiband sensors, focusing
on the development of new theories, technologies, and methods in these ﬁelds. The
research scheme of the project is shown in Fig. 14.2. During the project, the new
concept of moon-based Earth observation for global change monitoring was also
widely discussed and considered as an efﬁcient way to map the solid earth dynamics
and radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (Guo et al. 2014b, 2018).

Glaciers
Glaciers provide unique records and feedback that inﬂuence global climate change
and are closely related to temperature, precipitation, and the material balance. The
glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have retreated considerably since the 1970s, and this
rate of retreat has accelerated in recent years. In general, the retreat rate for glaciers
covering less than 1 km2 is faster than those of larger glaciers, but there are signiﬁcant
spatial differences. For example, glacial retreat was observed to be the fastest in the
Himalayas and slower in the central plateau (Yao et al. 2003). It has been suggested
that the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers is much more serious than expected (Ma
et al. 2010). Consequently, with the rapid melting of glaciers, lakes supplied by the
glacier melt water, such as Nam Co Lake (the highest lake on the central Tibetan
Plateau), have expanded between 1976 and 2009 (Zhang et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2015).
A method for extracting glacier thickness has been developed based on interfero-
metric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and elevation data from the Geoscience
Laser Altimeter System instrument aboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satel-
lite (ICESat/GLAS14). As a result of calculations using the ICESat data along with
the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM), a
reduction of 0.63 m per year (water equivalent) was observed in the thickness of the
Naimona’nyi glacier between 2000 and 2009 (Zong et al. 2013). This lies between
the material balance of 0.56 m per year (water equivalent) and the glacier thickness
14

487
reduction of 0.65 m per year (water equivalent) measured by GPS (Li et al. 2012). In
general, glacial shrinkage decreases toward the interior plateau from the Himalayas,
and the minimum degree of shrinkage occurs in the Pamir mountain range (Yao et al.
2012; Guo et al. 2015).
14.5.2
Lakes
Large ﬂuctuations in lake surface area in a short time signiﬁcantly inﬂuence water
cycles and the local ecological environments. Studies have been conducted on lake
areas, in addition to water level monitoring in different regions of the Tibetan Plateau
using Landsat and ICESat data. Since 2003, a large spatial variation in lake area on
the Tibetan Plateau has been observed, with a shrinkage of lakes in southern Tibet
and an expansion trend for lakes in the Qiangtang region (Liao et al. 2013). In the
Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Lake showed an expansion trend, and the annual rate of
change in water volume in spring was greater than that in autumn. Gyaring Lake
in the eastern Tibetan Plateau also showed an expansion trend that mirrored that of
Qinghai Lake (Liao et al. 2013). Glacial melt is the dominant driver of the recent lake
expansions on the Tibetan Plateau. By investigating detailed changes in the surface
area and levels of lakes across the Tibetan Plateau from Landsat/ICESat data, Li et al.
(2014) found a spatial pattern in the lake changes from 1970 to 2010 (especially after
2000). They observed a southwest-northeast transition from shrinking, to stable, to
rapidly expanding lakes, which suggests a limited inﬂuence of glacial melt on lake
dynamics. The plateau-wide pattern of lake area changes is related to precipitation
variations and is consistent with the pattern of permafrost degradation induced by
rising temperatures (Li et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2015).
14.5.3
Vegetation
The plant phenological period is closely related to climate change, and phenological
changesinﬂuencethecarbonbalanceofterrestrialecosystemsbyaffectingecosystem
productivity. The alpine vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau is extremely sensitive to
global change. Zhang et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2015) used MODIS to analyze the
response and driving factors of space observations of plant greenness and phenology
(Fig. 14.3). Zhang et al. (2013) found that the normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI) showed a gradual increasing trend in the plateau during the growing seasons
from 2000 to 2009. On the western Tibetan Plateau, the continuous decrease in
precipitation resulted in a delay in the alpine grassland phenology; in the eastern
part of the plateau, the precipitation continued to increase, resulting in an advance in
the grassland phenology (Wang et al. 2015). In addition, Liu et al. (2014) found that
the spring phenology of the grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau exhibited a stronger

season on the Tibetan Plateau during 2000–2009 (Zhang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2015; Guo et al.
2015)
response to changes in temperature at higher elevations than at lower elevations (Guo
et al. 2015).
The remote sensing and monitoring of C3 and C4 grass species and their responses
to climate change are mainly focused on the high-precision extraction of plant func-
tional types and the transformation response of the grassland type to global climate
change and human factors. In the U.S. Great Plains, vegetation with different func-
tional types usually shows similar temporal trends in NDVI but different phenological
characteristics (Wang et al. 2013). The onset of the growing season for C3 grasses
is earlier than that for C4 grasses, and the growing season of C3 grasses is longer.
However, under mild weather conditions, C3/C4 short grasses have similar onsets of
season dates and growing season lengths compared with C3/C4 tallgrasses (Wang
et al. 2013). In northern China, a study by Guan et al. (2012) showed that temperate
grassland was mainly occupied by C3 species, yet C4 species made an important
contribution to the grassland biomass.
The fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) is an important physi-
ological parameter that reﬂects the growth of vegetation and is a key parameter for
terrestrial ecosystem models and for reﬂecting global climate change (Fig. 14.4).
Peng et al. (2012) found that the spatial variation in the global fPAR was affected
Fig. 14.4 Spatial patterns of global fPAR: a annual average fPAR in 2006, and b average fPAR in
the latter half of August 2006. (Guo et al. 2015)

489
by the vegetation types as well as changes in the seasonal cycles. Temperature, pre-
cipitation and extreme drought have different effects on the fPAR. Climate change,
deforestation, reforestation, and other human activities also signiﬁcantly impact the
fPAR in regions such as southeast Asia and the Three-North Shelter Forest area in
China (Guo et al. 2015).
14.5.4
Radiation
(1) Impacts of aerosols on cloud cover and the regional radiation forcing effect
Based on satellite remote sensing data from aerosol-cloud-radiation and trace gases
and meteorological observations, Xia (2010, 2012) analyzed long-term trends in the
sunshine duration (SSD) and surface solar radiation and focused on the possible
impacts of clouds on solar radiation in China over the last 50 years. The results
indicated that the SSD and total cloud cover (TCC) showed a signiﬁcant decreasing
trend; however, with low-level cloud cover (LCC), a slight increasing trend was
observed (Xia 2010). Short-term variability in the SSD is mainly determined by the
amount of cloud cover, but the long-term change in the TCC cannot account for the
decreasing trend in the SSD. Regarding the impacts of aerosols on clouds, Xia (2012)
found that the data are inconsistent with the expectation that larger decreasing trends
in cloud cover should be observed in regions with higher aerosol loading. Therefore,
the aerosol effect on decreasing cloud cover in China does not appear to be supported
by the results of their study (Guo et al. 2015).
(2) Spatiotemporal characteristics of land surface solar radiation in China
The land surface solar radiation in China and its temporal trends were calculated
and the results demonstrate that previous studies overestimated the downward trend
in land surface solar radiation in China (Tang et al. 2011). However, the aerosol
abundance from human activities was still negligible on the Tibetan Plateau, and the
decrease in solar radiation over the plateau was larger in magnitude than that for the
rest of China after the 1970s. Further research revealed that the solar radiation on
the Tibetan Plateau had continually decreased over the preceding 30 years due to the
increasing water vapor and deep convective clouds. These increases were found to
be connected to the warming climate and the enhanced effective convection energy
of the Tibetan Plateau (Tang et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2015).

Digital Earth to Inform Climate Adaptation,
Mitigation, and Sustainable Development
Effective strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation require a com-
prehensive understanding of various underlying factors, including natural science,
economics, society, and ethics. This makes climate change one of the most complex
and challenging issues of modern times. Climate prediction and climate change pro-
jection are highly relevant to policy makers, investors, and vulnerable communities.
The Digital Earth platform allows for investigations into many important processes
that control the climate system, incorporates spatial dimensions at higher resolutions
into the climate change context, and enables intuitive visual support for decisions and
innovative actions. Strong visual and virtual demonstrations, supported by the Digi-
tal Earth platform, can help translate complex data into communicable information
to support governments in decision and policy development and public information
services.
Decades of Earth observation information is critical to improving predictions at
different scales of climate projections. However, the existing remote sensing prod-
ucts have defects such as noise and time and space discontinuity (Brown et al. 2006;
Jia et al. 2006). These defects severely constrain land surface processes and climate
change simulations that are driven by spatial data parameters, and therefore reduce
the reliability of climate change predictions and projections. It is necessary to syn-
thesize multisensor remote sensing data to obtain high-quality and spatiotemporally
continuous land surface observation data. The synthesis processes face the challenges
of multisensor remote sensing data coordination and validation (Guo et al. 2015).
These processes can greatly beneﬁt from the Digital Earth data framework.
In addition to climate-sensitive environmental parameters, socioeconomic param-
eters characterize the demographic, socioeconomic, and technological driving forces
underlying anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that have driven recent climate
change and are key in the assessment of climate impacts, adaptation, and vulnera-
bility. Conversely, the sensitivity, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity of socioeco-
nomic systems also depend on their responses to climate change. The IPCC Technical
Guidelines for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations recommend the
use of socioeconomic scenarios, with and without climate change, to assess climate
impacts and adaptive responses. This adds a layer of complexity to predicting future
scenarios and is only possible in the integrative environment provided by the Digital
Earth platform. The challenges in implementing socioeconomic scenarios in Digital
Earth include compatible scales that match the socioeconomic and satellite data, and
rational assumptions that represent the evolution of key socioeconomic drivers.
The Digital Earth platform can also support the implementation of the UN Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs) by providing a conducive platform for information
and data sharing, access, and use, and as a multisource data fusion platform. In
the near future, Earth science will extensively make use of large amounts of data to
monitor and predict continuously changing climatic environments. The Digital Earth
platform can handle the challenge of geographical big data and the new emerging
14
Digital Earth for Climate Change Research
491
threats from climate change more systematically and speciﬁcally (Elder et al. 2016;
Guo et al. 2017). This greatly enhances preparedness, rapid response, and adaptation
to extreme events (such as extreme weather events) and facilitates understanding of
the climate and projection of climate change.
In addition to geographical big data, a new form of geo-referenced data from
the internet and social media, when combined with newly available observational,
reanalysis, or other data sources on the Digital Earth platform, can potentially expand
the scope of climate change studies greatly and increase the spatial and temporal
scales addressed. For example, by using data from social networking sites, smart
phones, and online experiments, we can assess the vulnerability to weather events
and the impacts of local and national policies and programs in real time (Hernandez
2017).
Digital Earth has great potential for increasing our understanding of global climate
change and its impacts on various dimensions. It is a powerful platform for policy
support in climate change adaptation and mitigation. New developments in emerging
technologies such as “big Earth data”, citizen science, the blockchain, and artiﬁcial
intelligence further enhance the power of Digital Earth to support studies and actions
on climate change.

Abstract This chapter describes the state-of-the-art of the potential of Digital Earth
for progressively better solutions for disaster mitigation. The chapter illustrates the
use of strong Digital Earth tools for data sharing and important potential for users,
such as 2D or multi-D visualizations. Milestones of developments in early warning,
disaster risk management and disaster risk reduction concepts are highlighted as a
continuous movement between sustainable development and original concepts of dis-
aster risk reduction. Improved solutions have been based on new research directions
formulated in Sustainable Development Goals tasks and by expanding the possibil-
ities of new effective solutions via newly organized data ecosystems generated by
the United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management, the Group on Earth
Observations and the Group on Earth Observations System of Systems, Copernicus
and, more recently, the Digital Belt and Road initiative. The new trends in spatial
big data are emphasized; the most important for disaster risk reduction are the basic
theses of the U.N. Conference in Sendai. This chapter describes three aspects: inno-
vative Digital Earth development, national and local disaster risk assessment and
the beneﬁts arising from the use of maps and dynamic data, and analyses of the
contributions of cartography to disaster risk reduction.

For over 20 years, DE has witnessed an ebb and ﬂow in interest from the world’s
scientiﬁc community. Initially, it sought a place between activities focused strictly
on maps, data and information (Global Map—GM, Global Spatial Data Infrastruc-
ture—GSDI, etc.). Later, it began to push through with a comprehensive concept and
an emphasis on the need to share and integrate data and information, and impetus and
knowledge from the scientiﬁc realm, the private sector, and the needs of people in
different parts of the Earth. Today, novel solutions are expected from DE, which will
also signiﬁcantly help realize disaster risk reduction (DRR) and Disaster Mitigation
projects. Al Gore (former vice president of the USA) described a concept and deﬁ-
nition of Digital Earth in his speech in Los Angeles on January 1998, saying it is: “A
multiresolution, three-dimensional representation of the planet, into which we can
embed vast quantities of geo-referenced data” (Gore 1998). In 2008, Goodchild noted
that “Digital Earth includes four aspects: visualization, ease of use, interoperability
and mashups, modelling and simulation” (Goodchild 2008). Some of the best anal-
yses of the potential of the DE concept in the European Union (EU) are the SWOT
analyses by De Longueville et al. (2010a, b). Studies showed positive and attractive
aspects based on the political and economic support of inﬂuential countries such as
the USA, China and, more recently, Russia. They also found obstacles originating
from overly complex DE approaches that did not ﬁt the research concepts of the EU.
Clariﬁcation of DE leadership was also an issue. These aspects are all important for
ﬁnding more successful approaches to solve disaster mitigation and DRR problems
that are natural, societal or economical, as well as complex ones including known
and unidentiﬁed factors. In addition, knowledge and new technologies are develop-
ing. We now have access to new near- to real-time information resources such as
Prevention Web, the knowledge platform for disaster risk reduction managed by the
U.N. Ofﬁce for Disaster Risk Reduction (U.N. DRR), and research analyzing some
of the unsuccessful efforts in developed countries such as those during Hurricane
Katrina and recommending adequate steps in the future.
Section 15.2 describes the terminology used in disaster mitigation and this chapter
and as well as some of the supportive efforts of international scientiﬁc organizations.
Section 15.3 describes the development of early warning (EW), disaster risk man-
agement (DRM) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) concepts. Section 15.4 describes
Digital Earth for the future of disaster mitigation and DRR and innovative support of
the implementation of the Sendai Framework and existing geospatial projects, includ-
ing the U.N. Global Geospatial Information Management (U.N. GGIM), Copernicus,
Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and Digital Belt and Road
(DBAR). Section 15.5 introduces national and local disaster risk assessment and
the beneﬁts arising from the usage of maps and dynamic data. Section 15.6 ana-
lyzes and shows the development of selected disaster risk mapping approaches and
technologies with examples of adaptation principles, context map composition and
existing symbol systems. Studies have attempted to recognize how users and inhab-
itants understand information from databases, maps and specialized models. The
ﬁnal Sect. 15.7 discusses expected developments in the research and technology
background in the near-future. It will be necessary to accelerate the creation of new
15

concepts from new knowledge (like from the Hyogo Framework) and new environ-
ments created by the realization of ideas of the U.N. GGIM and Chinese DBAR. All
these approaches were developed on the same background as part of new data and
information media, demonstrating how the potential is open to all of society as well
as specialists and decision makers. Some of the approaches, such as mobile tools and
digital maps, are described in this chapter.
15.2
Terminology and Research Organization Efforts
A very important aspect of new approaches is the terminology. The United Nations
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (U.N. ISDR) created the ﬁrst terminol-
ogy from the ﬁelds of early warning, disaster risk management and disaster reduction,
which has been updated according to development the ﬁeld. In this chapter, selected
terminology from the U.N. ISDR is used.
The deﬁnitions of disaster mitigation, emergency, disaster damage, disaster
impact, disaster management, emergency management, disaster risk, acceptable risk,
residual risk, disaster risk assessment, disaster risk management, disaster risk reduc-
tion, early warning system, multi-hazard early warning system, and vulnerability can
be found in the U.N. ISDR (2009).
There are two globally operating organizations, the U.N. ISDR and Integrated
Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR), which formulate global tasks in the disaster risk
reduction (DRR) area. There are also activities in important world organizations and
by members of the International Science Council (ICSU). The ﬁrst working group
and later the Commission Cartography for Early Warning and Disaster Risk Man-
agement were founded within the International Cartographic Association—ICA (in
2004 and 2007, respectively, arranged by Konecny). The activities of the Interna-
tional Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), which started the
GI4DM organization, were also very fruitful as well as those of the International
Federation of Surveyors (FIG), which was organized during Working Week 2016 in
Christchurch, New Zealand, at the Recovery from Disaster conference.
15.3
Development of Early Warning (EW), Disaster Risk
Management (DRM) and Disaster Risk Reduction
(DRR) Concepts
In the past, DRM was solved together with problems of the environment, subse-
quently developed relatively separately, and a new DRR trend enhanced their close
cooperation in contemporary sustainable development efforts. There are two lines of
development in U.N. documents in approaches to crisis situations, both natural and
anthropogenic. They are:
498

(1) Environmental,linkedtoﬁndingthemostappropriateenvironmentalapproaches
to solve planet Earth’s problems. They are mainly oriented around concepts of
sustainabledevelopment(SD).Asaﬁrstimportantdocumentmentioningnatural
disasters in the Report on Approaches to Crisis Management Issues Related to
Development, U.N. environmental policies were created at the United Nations
Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm on 5–16 June 1972 (http://
www.biblebelievers.org.au/gc1972.htm). Later, this approach was documented
at the United Nations Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, in Johannesburg in
2002 and at many others.
(2) Crisis risk management (early warning, disaster management and disaster risk
reduction). The second line of development includes the Yokohama and Hyogo
World Conferences (1994 and 2005), the Global Platform for Disaster Risk
Reduction in Geneva in 2010 and the key concept of the “U.N. International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction” (ISDR—United Nations International Strat-
egy for Disaster Reduction). Another concept was developed in disaster risk
research, which addresses the problem of natural and human-induced environ-
mental hazards in IRDR (Integrated Research on Disaster Risk) (Konecny et al.
2010).
Three United Nations Conferences focused on DRR have been held. First, the
World Disaster Reduction Conference in Yokohama in 1994, which deﬁned the
Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer World: guidelines for natural
disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. The Second World Conference on
Disaster Reduction was held in Kobe, Japan from 18 to 22 January, 2005. The Hyogo
Framework for Action (2005–2015) (HFA): Building the Resilience of Nations and
Communities to Disasters was an outcome of the 2005 conference. The HFA set
ﬁve speciﬁc priorities for action: (1) making disaster risk reduction a priority; (2)
improving risk information and early warning; (3) building a culture of safety and
resilience; (4) reducing the risks in key sectors; and (5) strengthening prepared-
ness for response (WCDRR 2016). The third conference was the Third U.N. World
Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan in 2015 (United Nations
General Assembly 2015). The goals and role of research in the realization of these
topics are described in Sect. 15.4 of this chapter. The Sendai Framework materials
highlighted the need to tackle disaster risk reduction and climate change adaption
when setting the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in light of the insufﬁ-
cient focus on risk reduction and resilience in the original Millennium Development
Goals (WCDRR 2016).

and DRR: Innovative Support of the Implementation
of the Sendai Framework
15.4.1
Sendai Disaster Reduction Conference Targets
In the Third U.N. World Conference (U.N. DRR) on March 14, 2015 in Sendai,
Japan, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 was adopted
(United Nations General Assembly 2015). The U.N. DRR conference is a culmi-
nation of contemporary state-of-the-art approaches to solve the problems of risks
and disasters on our planet. The conference materials mentioned the role of Infor-
mation and Communication Technologies (ICT), geographical information system
(GIS), remote sensing, mapping, sensors, and volunteered geographic information.
The document does not mention explicitly Digital Earth, but the proposed solutions
follow lines deﬁned by Digital Earth pioneers and updated according to research
frontiers in the world. The necessity of design for deep integration of data and infor-
mation and the necessity of offering products to specialists, customers and all society
in an understandable way were emphasized.
The Sendai Framework deﬁned four new priorities of action:
• Priority 1: Understand disaster risk;
• Priority 2: Strengthen disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk;
• Priority 3: Invest in disaster risk reduction for resilience;
• Priority 4: Enhance disaster preparedness for effective response and “Build Back
Better” in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction (United Nations General
Assembly 2015).
The priorities are equally important to ﬁnd better solutions, and the Digital Earth
concept should be useful in addressing all of them. We discuss the priority 1 intentions
here. Researchers know enough about individual disasters, but are weak in their
knowledge when disasters are combined, as in the Fukushima nuclear power station
collapse or the Wenchuan earthquake. It is very valuable that solutions are being
accepted at global, national, regional and local levels. In priority 1: Understanding
disaster risk, on national and local levels, there are requests to develop, periodically
update and disseminate location-based disaster risk information such as risk maps to
decision makers, the general public and communities at risk of exposure to a disaster
in an appropriate format by using applicable geospatial information technology. In
addition, local and national organizations promote real-time access to reliable data,
make use of space and in situ information, including geographic information systems
(GIS), and use information and communication technologies innovations to enhance
measurement tools and the collection, analysis and dissemination of data.
The DRR framework deﬁned in Sendai is inextricably linked with the main U.N.
document deﬁning the Sustainable Development Goals 2015–2030 (SDGs).

15.4.2
Global Development Policy Framework (GDPF)
With other U.N. documents such as the Sendai Framework for DRR 2015–2030, the
SIDS Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda,
the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the HABITAT III Urban Agenda, the
SDGs created a newly formulated Global Development Policy Framework (GDPF)
(Fig. 15.1).
In addition to natural disasters, there are new issues connected with problems
of cities or megacities from the geospatial information perspective in particular and
for DE in general. These problems are deﬁned in another activity of the GDPF—
HABITAT III. Its key document “The New Urban Agenda” was adopted at the United
Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III)
in Quito, Ecuador (United Nations 2016) and represents a shared vision for a better
and more sustainable future. If well-planned and well-managed, urbanization can
be a powerful tool for sustainable development for both developing and developed
countries. The conference reached a critical point in understanding that cities can be
the source of solutions to, rather than the cause of, the challenges that our world is
facing today.
The New Urban Agenda presents a paradigm shift based on the science of cities;
it lays out standards and principles for the planning, construction, development,
management, and improvement of urban areas. The agenda also incorporates a new
recognition of the correlation between good urbanization and development. The New
Urban Agenda realizes the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially

Goal 11 on Sustainable cities and communities. It also planned to adopt and imple-
ment DRR and management, reduce vulnerability, build resilience and responsive-
ness to natural and human-made hazards and foster the mitigation of and adaptation
to climate change. DRR is aimed at preventing new risk, reducing existing disaster
risk and managing residual risk, all of which contribute to strengthening resilience
and therefore to the achievement of sustainable development. DRR is the policy
objective of disaster risk management, and its goals and objectives are deﬁned in
disaster risk reduction strategies and plans.
To improve the quality of solutions in disaster mitigation and DRR, U.N. member
states should facilitate the strengthening and normative capacity-building of global
geospatial information management in support of the implementation of the 2030
Agenda. Efforts include promoting the use of geospatial information systems and
services for modern mapping, methodological development, national and regional
capacity-building, setting of standards, data collection, dissemination and sharing,
and better integration of geospatial and statistical information systems of U.N. Mem-
ber States.
15.4.3
U.N. GGIM
A newly established Global Data Ecosystem by the U.N. Global Geospatial Infor-
mation Management (U.N. GGIM) will support realization of the SDGs, including
all aspects linked with DRR, to respond to global data ecosystem needs. It helps to
develop the global understanding of geospatial information and, in a second step,
its coordination, coherence and implementation. The vision is to position geospatial
information to address global challenges and missions to ensure that geospatial infor-
mation and resources are coordinated maintained, accessible, and used effectively
and efﬁciently by member states and society to address key global challenges in a
timely manner.
In the U.N. GGIM, Scott deﬁned the data needs for the 2030 Agenda as follows
(Scott 2018): “The scope of the 2030 Agenda requires high-quality and disaggregated
data that are timely, open, accessible, understandable and easy to use for a large range
of users, including for decision making at all levels. There is a need for a reporting
system on the SDGs that would have beneﬁt from the subnational (local) to the
national level; and allow for global reporting that builds directly on the data shared by
countries. It is important to create an opportunity for countries to directly contribute
to the global reporting. While the challenges are immense, the digital technology that
is available today allows the necessary transformation. An aspiration is to strengthen
countries’ national geospatial and statistical information systems to facilitate and
enable a ‘data ecosystem’ that leverages an accessible, integrative and interoperable
local to global system-of-systems.”
502
M. Konecny et al.
The U.N. GGIM is the newest initiative to qualitatively improve the potential
to solve the problems of the world, including disaster mitigation. In addition, other
important initiatives have the same aim in speciﬁc regions of the World—e.g., Coper-
nicus for Europe and the Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) initiative in Asia.
15.4.4
Copernicus—A European Contribution to GEOSS
Copernicus (formerly Global Monitoring for Environment and Security—GMES)
is a European project based on data received from Earth observation satellites and
ground-based information. These data are coordinated, analyzed and prepared for
end users. Through Copernicus, the state of our environment and its short-, medium-
and long-term evolution are monitored to support policy decisions and investments.
Copernicus plays key role in EU EW, DRM and DRR efforts. Copernicus mainly
supports decision making by institutional and private actors. Decisions can concern
new regulations to preserve our environment or urgent measures in the case of natural
or man–made catastrophes (i.e., ﬂoods, forest ﬁres, water pollution) on a global
scale. The services are used by environmental agencies, local, regional and national
authorities, and civil protection organizations. The new observation techniques and
analysis of data will allow for these actors to better anticipate potential threats,
to intervene in a timely manner and to increase the efﬁciency of the intervention.

Copernicus (and its INSPIRE component) is the European contribution and par-
ticipation in the worldwide monitoring and management of planet Earth organized
by the Group on Earth Observation (GEO). The global community acts together for a
synergy of all techniques of observation, detection and analysis. At the World Summit
on Earth Observation in Washington in July 2003, the Group on Earth Observations
(GEO) was established with the goal of addressing the information requirements for
the environment on a global scale. In Brussels in February 2005, a 10-year imple-
mentation plan of an integrated global earth observation system of systems (GEOSS)
was deﬁned. A number of operational systems for supporting disaster response have
made steady to strong progress. Collaborative supersites have been established for
the scientiﬁc community to monitor and analyze volcanoes and earthquakes more
rapidly and effectively; for example, supersites have improved the assessment of
earthquakes in Haiti, China, Chile, and Indonesia. One example is SERVIR that pro-
vides mapping for disaster response and has assisted countries in Central America
and the Caribbean in responding to hurricanes, earthquakes and other extreme events
(GEOSS 2019).
15.4.5
Digital Belt and Road Program—Disaster Efforts
The Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) program and Digital Silk Road Alliance (DSRA)
are relatively new activities initiated by the Silk Belt and Road (BAR) initiative. The
DBAR is a pioneering international venture to share expertise, knowledge, technolo-
gies and data to demonstrate the signiﬁcance of Earth observation science and tech-
nology and applications for large-scale sustainable development projects. The exten-
sive geographical scope of the “BAR” initiative calls for smart uses and applications
of big Earth data in the design, development and implementation of diverse projects
related to infrastructure improvement, environmental protection, disaster risk reduc-
tion, water resource management, urban development, food security, coastal zone
management, and the conservation and management of natural and cultural heritage
sites. DBAR is committed to implementing projects and actions relevant to the 17
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in Septem-
ber 2015 (United Nations Brussels Team 2018). In the DBAR, natural hazards are an
important issue. Belt and Road nations experience approximately 85% of the world’s
major earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, ﬂoods, droughts and heatwaves. For exam-
ple, more than 86,000 people were killed or reported missing in a massive earthquake
in Wenchuan, China in May 2008 and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami
killed hundreds of thousands of people. Seven of the top ten countries that saw major
losses from disasters between 1995 and 2014 are in this region (Guo 2018, p. 26).
The program monitors different types of ecosystems and their evolution, including
504
M. Konecny et al.
grasslands, forests, glaciers, urban areas, farmland and coastal regions. Environmen-
tal and socioeconomic information will be shared through a platform for big Earth
data, scheduled for roll-out between 2016 and 2026. This open-access gateway will
allow for researchers, policy makers and the public to track changes, development
and trends. The program will investigate indices and indicators to feed into the UN’s
2030 Sustainable Development Goals (Guo 2018).
Working group 6 of the DBAR says that DBAR disaster aims to integrate Earth
observations (EO) and social vulnerability data to promote implementation of the
Sendai Framework in countries along the BAR region. The approach taken by
this WG covers satellite information and communication technologies as well as
implementation-oriented technologies that involve hardware solutions for risk reduc-
tion challenges. “If we do nothing, sensitive environments will be lost and exposure
to risks will rise” (Guo 2018).
There are efforts to ﬁnd solutions using newly deﬁned ideas about big Earth
Data. There are four main obstacles to a strategy for the Belt and Road region: poor
access to data; a digital divide between developed and developing countries; a lack
of awareness of the potential of Earth observations among some policy makers, local
scientists and practitioners; and a lack of collaboration. These are long-standing
problems—they also slowed emergency responses during and after the Indian Ocean
tsunami in 2004, for example.
Important consequences of DBAR strategies necessitate research on new
approaches and knowledge improvements. There should be proof of concept for the
data. Guo is developing a new concept of big Scientiﬁc data and big Earth Data (Guo
2017, p. 4): “Big data is a revolutionary innovation that has allowed the development
of many new methods in scientiﬁc research. This new way of thinking has encour-
aged the pursuit of new discoveries. Big data occupies the strategic high ground in the
era of knowledge economies and also constitutes a new national and global strategic
resource. “Big Earth data”, derived from, but not limited to, Earth observation, has
macro-level capabilities that enable rapid and accurate monitoring of the Earth, and
is becoming a new frontier contributing to the advancement of Earth science and
signiﬁcant scientiﬁc discoveries. … Big data research is different from traditional
logical research. It uses analytical induction applied to a vast amount of data to sta-
tistically search, compare, cluster, and classify. It involves correlation analysis and
implies that there may be certain a regularity in the relation between the values of
two or more variables; it also aims to uncover hidden correlated networks.”
The substantive characteristics of big data computing comprise a paradigm shift
from model-driven science to data-driven science, as well as the establishment of a
data-intensive scientiﬁc approach.
As a branch of big data, scientiﬁc big data is a typical representative of data-
intensive science. Scientiﬁc big data has a number of characteristics, including com-
plexity, comprehensiveness, and global coverage, as well as a high degree of inte-
gration with information and communication technology. The approaches used in
science are also being transformed—from single-discipline to multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary approaches, from natural science to the integration of natural and
15
Digital Earth for Disaster Mitigation
505
social sciences, and from work carried out by individuals or small research groups
to projects coordinated by international scientiﬁc organizations.
In addition to helping scientists solve hard or previously unsolvable problems
through real-time dynamic monitoring and analysis of various related data, the data
itself can become an object and tool of research: scientists can conceive, design, and
implement research based on the data (Hey et al. 2009 in Guo 2017).
Earth science research, including the atmosphere, land and ocean, has produced
huge datasets derived from satellite observations, ground sensor networks, and other
sources. This is collectively called big Earth data. Big Earth data has features in
common with scientiﬁc big data and also has unique characteristics. Big Earth data
is characterized as being massive, multisource, heterogeneous, multitemporal, mul-
tiscale, high-dimensional, highly complex, nonstationary, and unstructured. It pro-
vides support for data-intensive research in the Earth sciences. Modern Earth sci-
ence requires globally established, quasi real-time, all-weather Earth data acquisition
capabilities, and has developed an integrated space-air-ground observation system
with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions (Guo 2017).
To realize the above-mentioned efforts, the ISDE organization initiated the Digital
Silk Road Alliance (DSRA), established in Sydney in April 2017 with the support of
the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST), with the aim of building a
network of scientists involved in the Digital Belt and Road initiative and using Digital
Earth and geospatial information technologies to solve the scientiﬁc problems facing
human beings, and to address problems related to the U.N. Sustainable Development
Goals.
The DSRA wants to develop Digital Earth in the ﬁelds of cartography, remote
sensing and geo-information sciences, which are essential for socioeconomic devel-
opment. Further development of cooperation mechanisms and frameworks toward
the development of Earth observation systems and Digital Earth is expected. It is
important to use such approaches on global and regional levels in the realms of Earth
observation and Digital Earth.
15.4.6
GGIM and DBAR Comparisons and Potential
Comparing the contemporary differences between the U.N. GGIM and the DBAR,
the U.N. GGIM is a mature project connected with stable governmental and public
infrastructures aiming to address the needs of the SDGs and Sendai DRR and con-
temporary needs of civil society and its organizations. DBAR has similar ambitions
but primarily originated from the countries where spatial data infrastructure (SDI)
and national data infrastructure (NSDI) were still not fully developed according to
the Silk Belt and Road. The DBAR has a new approach to look for and elaborate big
data, mainly based on satellite images. There are still missing concepts regarding
delivery of data to interesting groups, the private sector and individual inhabitants
(such as the U.N. GGIM using INSPIRE knowledge and experiences). Along the Belt
and Road, countries have different political and economic systems and different data,
506
M. Konecny et al.
information and knowledge policies. There has been great investment in the DBAR,
which created hopes for fast improvement of the situation, but data and information
are only part of the efforts, including DRR. In many countries, geoinformatics and
cartography are unappreciated. Maps are created without knowledge of how they will
be accepted by users (context and adaptive maps) and how the information should
be delivered for professionals and public users. This is very important in EW, DRM
and DRR.
It is difﬁcult to say which areas will beneﬁt more from Digital Earth. Because
the problems are very complex, their solutions require powerful and adaptable tools.
Digital Earth is based on integration of various streams and determination of adequate
decisions. Informed decisions also rely on the wishes, opinions and reactions of
societies, which can be collected via information from social media or volunteers in
the ﬁeld.
It is likely that the main tasks of the U.N. GGIM will be realized incrementally.
DBAR activities elaborating important and new aspects of the big data reality will
create new situations in data policies in the countries along the Silk Road and Belt.
Convergence of both streams will be inevitable and will lead to realization of the
dreams of the founders of SDI and NSDI as well as appreciation of modern visual-
ization methods, mainly cartographical ones. Those methods will help experts and
the contemporary public to understand problems and cooperate to create solutions
for disaster mitigation problems.
15.5
Digital Earth for National and Local Disaster Risk
Assessment
Digital Earth is suitable for reporting practices that have been already tested and
implemented in one locality and can be successfully adapted in another. Sharing of
practices is important in any ﬁeld of human activity, including disaster risk manage-
ment. As noted by Amaratunga et al. (2015), sharing of sound practices is intended
to improve knowledge sharing for exchange of data and experiences between users
on every level—global, national and local.
15.5.1
National Level
The goal of every state is to identify and minimalize risks in its territory. In the
Czech Republic, a group of emergency management experts studied the emergency
threats and vulnerabilities (Paulus et al. 2016) and identiﬁed and categorized the most
typical emergency situations. From this analysis, 22 typological emergency situa-
tions were pinpointed. A detailed and typiﬁed plan for each emergency was deﬁned,
including the responsible public administrative organization and the administrative
15
Digital Earth for Disaster Mitigation
507
level on which the plans are used (central, regional, local). An indispensable part of
each typiﬁed plan is the list of recommended spatial data and maps necessary for
a successful reckoning of a particular emergency. Public administration bodies are
responsible for the development of action plans on the regional and local levels and
for identiﬁcation of key stakeholders.
15.5.2
Local Level—Cities and Urban Areas
A report titled “State of Disaster Risk Reduction at the Local Level: A report on
the Patterns of Disaster Risk Reduction Actions at Local Level” (Amaratunga et al.
2015) focuses on disaster risk reduction in urban areas: “Fast growing cities and
urban areas of the world increase disaster risk due to economic growth and fast
population expansion. … Sound practices that have been tested and implemented
by different cities around the world aid knowledge sharing opportunities for future
disaster risk reduction. … The intent is to provide local governments and other
institutions learn from one another by effectively facilitating the sharing of sound
practices and disseminating these established sound practices in risk reduction.”
Ten essential goals and examples of well-functioning solutions for local govern-
ments to make their cities more disaster-resilient were deﬁned and are listed below
(U.N. ISDR 2012).
15.5.3
Existing Methodologies for Risk Assessment
Overviews of how to map and estimate risk have been presented by several scholars
(Kappes et al. 2012; Klucka 2014; Forzieri et al. 2016). The European Commission
published the Risk Assessment and Mapping Guidelines for Disaster Management
(EC 2010), but it was not the ﬁrst draft of such a pan-European manual. For example,
the output of the European project Interreg IIIC Interregional Response to SIPROCI,
to which seven countries contributed, is even wider and more thorough than the above
mentioned EU ﬁnal document but was never fully implemented at the European
level (SIPROCI 2007). An example of a major non-EU agency that deals with risk
discovery and estimation is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
from the USA. FEMA announced the release of the State Mitigation Plan Review
Guide in 2016 (FEMA 2016) that aids state, tribal, or local governments in developing
hazard mitigation plans.
508
M. Konecny et al.
15.5.4
Using Maps for Risk Assessment
An important part of any methodology for identifying and estimating risks is the
design of presentations to professionals and the general public. The ideal way to view
the risk estimates clearly is a map. The signiﬁcance and role of maps is described in
the book Successful Response Starts with a Map (National Research Council 2007),
prepared as a Hurricane Katrina analysis. The creation of maps for risk identiﬁcation
was also described by the above mentioned SIPROCI project (2007) and by other
authors including Carpignano et al. (2009) and Winter (1993) described in Dymon
(1994). Carpignano et al. (2009) described the development of a decision support
system based on a multirisk approach that can overcome difﬁculties in the overall
risk assessment for a territory. To deﬁne multirisk maps, a multirisk perspective and
stakeholder’s perceptions were integrated into a classical risk assessment frame. The
speciﬁc purpose of this work is to describe the methodological framework built at
this stage of the project and discuss the initial results.
Dymon (1994) describes a hazard management map taxonomy offered by Winter
(1993) that regards hazard, risk and emergency as the three major categories:
• Hazard maps identify and display the location of hazard zones, areas where there
are dangers to humans and their property.
• Risk maps (vulnerability) require calculation of the conditional probability that
a given area will experience a particular hazard or a combination of hazards and
portray the spatial distribution of those risk computations.
• Emergency maps comprise three additional types: planning, evacuation and crisis
maps.
The SIPROCI report (2007) provides a comprehensive method for risk mapping.
However, speciﬁc proposals were not included in the ofﬁcial ﬁnal methodology
(EC 2010). However, conclusions and recommendations were incorporated into the
methodology, such as the by the Fire Rescue Service in the Czech Republic (Krömer
et al. 2010), which recommends creating the following types of maps:
• Hazard map—a summary map of the different types of hazards, i.e., a digital map
of the manifestations of individual types of emergencies.
• Vulnerability map—the indicator of accumulated vulnerability of the territory as
a sum of partial elements of vulnerability.
• Preparedness map—readiness in the territory can be expressed as the availability of
forces and means (components of the integrated rescue system) and the availability
of means of protection of the population (e.g., coverage of the territory by end
elements of the warning).
• Risk map—a summary of all the above map types.
In its ofﬁcial methodology, the EU Risk Assessment and Mapping Guidelines for
Disaster Management (EC 2010) only include general recommendations for prepar-
ing these types of maps:
15
Digital Earth for Disaster Mitigation
509
• Maps of the spatial distribution of major hazards show the spatial distribution of
all relevant elements that need to be protected, such as population, infrastructures,
and naturally protected areas.
• The spatial distribution of vulnerability in terms of the susceptibility to damage
for all relevant subjects.
• These maps can then provide the basis for the preparation of risk maps in terms of
showing the combination of the likelihood and impact of a certain event, as well
as for creating of aggregated hazard maps.
However, speciﬁc mapping requirements for risk assessment only appear in EU
directives for ﬂood mapping such as the Floods Directive (EC 2007). Flood risk
mapping is the area of disaster management in which mapping methodologies have
advanced the most. The EU directive on the ‘Assessment and management of ﬂood
risks’ requires Member States to conduct an initial assessment for ﬂood hazard maps
and ﬂood risk maps:
• The hazard maps should cover geographic areas that could be ﬂooded according to
differentscenarios.Floodhazardmapsshowtheextentofﬂoodsathigh-(optional),
medium- (at least a 100-year return period) and low-probability ﬂoods or extreme
events.
• Risk maps should show the potential adverse consequences associated with ﬂoods
under those scenarios.
15.5.5
The Beneﬁts of Digital Earth for Risk
Assessment—Using Dynamic Data
Creating maps with the standardized content and symbolism mentioned in the previ-
ous section is necessary for preparing the components of an integrated rescue system
for crisis situations and for managing them. However, the basis of the Digital Earth
concept is not the creation of printed and static maps, but the dynamic sharing of
different types of data, including near-real time data sharing. The development of
electronics, networks, databases, data sharing (included in Digital Earth) brings new
possibilities for risk assessment.
As an example, for a risk assessment at a particular location and at a certain time, it
is possible to take advantage of the current location of mobile phones, from which the
present population can be estimated more accurately than using the standard census
data. Extensive studies focused on different aspects of human presence estimation
based on mobile phone data have been presented, particularly from Europe and Asia
(Ahas et al. 2010; Batista e Silva et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2017; Järv et al. 2017; Kang
et al. 2012). Kubíˇcek et al. (2018) proposed analysis of human presence using data
from mobile operators. The analysis is based on a dataset describing the estimated
human presence (EHP) with two values—visitors and transiting persons—depending
on the overall time spent within a speciﬁc mobile cell.
510
M. Konecny et al.
The advantage of using the EHP numbers over data from a census was analyzed
during the Integrated Rescue System training held in 2017 in Brno, Czech Republic.
The goal was to decide where to locate water tanks with supplies of drinking water
for inhabitants in case the standard water supply network becomes contaminated.
This emergency situation is demonstrated in Fig. 15.3. “The location-allocation
analysis on the leftmost side only takes into account census data and evenly dis-
tributed population throughout the administrative unit. Each water tank can supply
approximately 2000 people. The second analysis adjusts the water tank locations
according to the real locations of buildings and population in administrative units.
The third and fourth analysis quantiﬁes the EHP for working days and weekends.
Using of EHP proposes a greater number of necessary water tanks in administra-
tive units, and their optimal locations change according population ﬂuctuations”
(Kubíˇcek et al. 2018).
Risk assessment is addressed at different levels (international, national and local),
and each of these levels has its own goals and uses. It is very useful to share expe-
riences and data between these levels. This allows for generalization of knowledge
and results from the local level to the national and international levels. Such analyses
can become an engine for developing better risk assessment methods and disaster
mitigation. The Digital Earth concept linking databases and enabling data sharing
provides a methodological and technological background for this goal.

Digital Earth and Disaster Risk Mapping Technology
15.6.1
The Role of Cartography in Disaster Risk Mapping
In the frame of disaster risk mapping, geographic knowledge is crucial for making
proper decisions. The importance of spatial information and its potential support for
emergency actions were stressed and evaluated by several authors (Kevany 2008;
Zlatanova and Li 2008; and Konecny 2006). Among the various ways to transmit,
share, and visualize geographic knowledge, cartography is one of the most important.
Cartography and geoinformatics have experienced a huge technological shift over
the last 30 years. Digital Earth systems have become important foundations for data
management related to geographic phenomena.
The application of dynamic cartographic visualization opens the possibilities of
adaptive cartography. It allows for creating maps of current risks (e.g., current and
predicted ﬂooded area or direction of ﬁre spread), the location of nearby emergency
services, or escape routes for the population at risk.
The theory of using adaptive cartography for emergency management geographic
support was described by Reichenbacher (2003) and Meng (2005). This method
is based on the idea of geographic data visualization automation and adjustment
according to the situation, purpose and user’s background (Reichenbacher 2003).
The adaptation of maps can generally be deﬁned by a number of “Ws”—what,
when, where, who, and how—as documented in Fig. 15.4. It illustrates the types of
contexts that can inﬂuence the conditions of disaster risk mapping.
Fig. 15.4 Possible contexts inﬂuencing map use and mapping. Adapted from Kozel et al. (2011)
512
M. Konecny et al.
15.6.2
Use Case Examples
The adaptive mapping principles described in the previous section were demonstrated
in several scenarios, e.g., Talhofer et al. 2007, Mulickova et al. 2007. One of the
scenarios, called “FLOOD”, aims to improve ﬂood management. A case study was
practically veriﬁed in the winter of 2011/2012, when one of the ﬁeld experiments
was performed. Based on an analysis of the ﬂood management system in the Czech
Republic (Kubíˇcek et al. 2011), ﬁve main ACTIVITIES were deﬁned for the Flood
Use case (SITUATION):
• PREDICTION AND PROGRESS—development and expected progress of the
ﬂood
• TECHNICAL SUPPORT—technical support in the inundated area—support of
Flood Security Activities
• RESCUE—the evacuation of citizens
• ORGANIZATION—an organization of powers and means
• PUBLIC INFORMATION—information for the public on ﬂood development,
evacuation, etc.
Some of the ACTIVITIES deﬁned above are universal (e.g., organization) and
may be performed in different SITUATIONS whereas others (e.g., ﬂood prediction)
are situation-speciﬁc.
There
were
a
few
principal
operational
ranges
deﬁned
in
the
pre-
sented use case: FLOODPLAIN for detailed information on the inundation,
REGION/DISTRICT/MUNICIPALITY to comply with the hierarchical order of the
ﬂood management system, CATCHMENT to monitor the ﬂood at natural borderlines,
and SECTION for a detailed view of the municipality.
15.6.3
Use Case Adaptation Principles
The fact that an object is evaluated from the perspective of a deﬁned context is
fundamental to the map symbol adaptation process. The most important aspect of
the geographic feature may not be the character of the object as deﬁned by the data
source, but what ROLE it plays in the decision-making process. The map symbol is
an expression of such a ROLE. Because the data are typically collected for purposes
other than emergency management, semantic relations must be deﬁned, and new
roles should be speciﬁed.
Based on context, the semantic relevance is assessed. Information on the geo-
graphic object is relevant if it is necessary for the decision-making process within
the context. The relevancy assessment is important from the cartographic point of
view since the large number of objects that are visualized on the map limit its legibil-
ity and thus the effectiveness of the cartographic visualization as a decision support
tool.
15
Digital Earth for Disaster Mitigation
513
When information is relevant, we can assess the degree of relevancy and use
other cartography means to increase/decrease the importance of a spatial object or
phenomena. The relevancy degree can be assessed for both the semantic and spatial
aspects, as illustrated in Fig. 15.5.
The activity and the crisis event itself undergo temporal changes and thus the
object properties change as well. For example, if the water level is rising and another
house is endangered or a house is already evacuated. These facts should be considered
during map symbol design.
15.6.4
Context Map Composition
The process of data model deﬁnition is illustrated in Fig. 15.6. The emergency context
deﬁnes the basic data model (e.g. the information content of the map), and relevant
Fig. 15.5 Degrees of spatial and semantic relevance. Cartographic symbols prepared by L. Fried-
mannova. Adapted from: Brezinova et al. (2011)
Fig. 15.6 Data model deﬁnition. Adapted from Mulickova (2011)
514
M. Konecny et al.
features of the models BASETOPO, CRITICAL, and CONTEXT SPECIFIC are
selected. The basic model is then modiﬁed as the context is more precisely speciﬁed
(i.e., according to the PHASE). The model is generalized and further speciﬁed for
each level of detail within the operation range.
The examples of a context map for ﬂood management in Fig. 15.7 document dif-
ferent context views of the spatial database. Context maps for three emergency con-
texts—PREDICTION (A), RESCUE (B, D) and ORGANIZATION (C) are shown.
The level of detail corresponds with the operation range “section”. Maps share the
same topographic background (i.e., BASETOPO) and, to a certain extent, ﬂood-
SPECIFIC features (i.e., the ﬂood extent and buildings in it). The visualizations
differ in activity-speciﬁc features—i.e., features speciﬁc to prediction (ﬂood activity
degree, number of affected persons), to the organization (places of intervention and
its description) and to the rescue efforts (evacuation zones, routes). The features of
the CRITICAL model are not included.
Maps A and B in Fig. 15.7 illustrate the phase of preparation—there is no ﬂooding
yet but there is a prediction of ﬂooding. At that time, houses are endangered. In
the response phase (Maps C and D), houses are already affected. The visualization
changes are based on the progress of the disaster event.
Maps B and D support the same activity (i.e., rescue) but in different phases.
The maps display visualization changes based on the progress of the activity. In the
preparation phase, the zone of evacuation is marked and buildings for evacuation are
selected. In the response phase, all the buildings are already evacuated.
A possible technical implementation is described in detail by Kozel (2009) and
Kozel and Štampach (2010).
15.6.5
Existing Symbol Systems for Disaster Management
Cartography plays a key role in disaster management for a clear representation of
the necessary objects and phenomena to decision makers. Upon the occurrence of
disasters, crisis management actors need specialized maps to provide a clear idea
of the emergency, localization, distribution and characteristics. One of the objec-
tives of cartographers is to design effective representation of spatial information
through graphic symbols (Akella 2009). The symbols should indicate information
about depicted objects and phenomena without the use of a legend, especially in an
emergency. They should also provide users qualitative and quantitative information
for the presented object or phenomenon (Konecny and Bandrova 2006).
A number of agencies and organizations related to disaster protection have devel-
oped databases, geo-portals and cartographic products for crisis management and
adopted their own standards for symbols.
One of the most popular symbol systems for crisis management is the set of
500 humanitarian symbols of the United Nations Ofﬁce for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The symbols are freely available at http://reliefweb.
int/ and aim to help disaster responders present information about crisis situations

quickly and simply (United Nations Ofﬁce for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs 2012). The symbols can be used to produce humanitarian reports, maps, and
websites. The OCHA humanitarian icons are divided into 17 categories. The set of
symbols covers both disasters and activities, including the supply of water containers
and equipment shelter, access to people in need and protection of civilians. The icons
are associative and have a simple structure that allows for easy comprehension.

M. Konecny et al.
The Emergency Mapping Symbology (EMS) in Canada was developed under the
auspices of GeoConnections, with participation from emergency management orga-
nizations across Canada. It was designed to be used by federal, provincial, regional
and local organizations involved in the management of major events, disasters, and
other incidents where emergency help and security are needed (GeoConnections
2010). The EMS contains a set of symbols and a four-level, hierarchical classiﬁca-
tion of the entities. The categories include incidents, infrastructures, operations, and
aggregates. Symbols in the same category have similar colors. There is also a second
version of the symbols adapted for black and white printing.
The Association of Volunteer Emergency Response Teams developed a project
called Disaster Response Map Symbols (DRMS) as an effort to compile a standard set
of symbols aimed to support the creation of efﬁcient maps for disaster management.
It comprises 285 symbols. The DRMS contains 5 families of symbols in a single font,
includingvehicles,infrastructure,mobile/temporaryservicesandteams,events,ships
and some special symbols (Association of Volunteer Emergency Response Teams
2009).
Another popular symbol system is the symbology developed by federal, state, and
local agencies in the USA working together under the auspices of the Federal Geo-
graphic Data Committee (FGDC) Homeland Security Working Group. The symbol
system includes symbols and their deﬁnitions for the categories of incidents, natural
events, operations, and infrastructures. The structure of each category and a damage-
operational status hierarchy were developed using color and frame shapes with line
patterns (Homeland Security Working Group 2017). The symbols are designed to be
presented in color or black and white formats.
The cartographic symbols should have clear and short deﬁnitions to be used in
a map legend. One very important characteristic is that they are situated on a map
and should indicate qualitative and quantitative information about the represented
object, phenomena or process to users.
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of existing emergency symbol
systems, a new symbol system for the needs of disaster management was developed
at the Laboratory on Cartography of the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering
and Geodesy in Soﬁa. The Symbol System for Disaster Management (SSDM) was
developed to support thematic mapping for early warning and crisis management
and operational activities of all participants in disaster management, as well as to
help citizens understand specialized emergency maps. The SSDM was designed to
be useful for the general public as well as for professionals.

Opportunities for New Disaster Risk Mapping
Technologies
The technological shifts in cartography and geoinformatics were on the level of data
analysis and visualization, bringing new data sources from different sensors and
mapping strategies. One of the most notable examples of this is cell phone data.
Data derived from active cell phones or active SIM cards for some administra-
tive units are becoming available for various uses (see an example from the Czech
Republic, the O2 Liberty API, https://www.o2.cz/podnikatel/liberty-api/). Analysis
of the number of SIM cards and existing demographic data has opened a novel set
of possible applications for emergency management and disaster risk mapping. The
availability of cell phone data enables the following:
• More accurate estimation of the actual number of inhabitants within the admin-
istrative unit and their temporal rhythms (example on Brno, Czech Republic in
Kubíˇcek et al. 2018). Comparing such an analysis with the existing census data
and annual demographic reports (see Fig. 15.8), the administrative units can be
further divided into several typological units (with the maximum during working
days, weekends, etc.) In addition, the population estimations can be used to better
plan the evacuation and other inhabitant-sensitive activities during emergencies.
• The cell phone data analysis often reveals regular trends as described above and
some irregular peaks and peculiarities. These high concentrations of inhabitants
are connected with cultural and sports events such as concerts and music festivals.

Future Directions—New Symbol System for Disaster
Management (SSDM)
The examples, approaches and case studies described above provide various oppor-
tunities for future development and applications such as the development of virtual
and augmented reality tools and devices. The Digital Earth concept can be also
understood as a virtual reality system (Çöltekin et al. 2019).
The new cartographic Symbol System for Disaster Management (SSDM) was cre-
ated in Bulgaria after proposing a classiﬁcation structure of represented objects and
phenomena, construction and design of symbols, implementation in real situations
and use in map compiling for disaster preparedness.
15.6.7.1
Classiﬁcation Structure
The SSDM consists of a 4-level hierarchical classiﬁcation of objects and phenomena
concerning disaster management and a set of 115 symbols. At the highest level,
the objects are divided into 5 categories: disasters, infrastructure, protection services
and safety infrastructure, affected people and infrastructure, and operational sites and
activities. Each category is divided into classes, which are divided into subclasses
that consist of objects and phenomena (Fig. 15.9).
15.6.7.2
Design of Symbols
The ability of symbols to transmit information and the way they are perceived by
map users are critically important. The design process of the SSDM started with
consideration of the rules of construction and use of symbol systems, examination
of the relations between objects and phenomena, their classiﬁcation and speciﬁcs.
Fig. 15.9 Classiﬁcation structure Source Marinova (2018)
15
Digital Earth for Disaster Mitigation
519
The design was accompanied by optimal requirements to achieve readability, expres-
siveness and visibility, taking into account modern technologies and techniques in
cartography. It is challenging to choose graphical variables so that all the symbols
can be quickly and easily perceived and are associative and properly referred to their
respective categories.
All categories of the SSDM are distinguishable by their shape and color. The
symbols consist of white pictograms and shapes with various background colors.
The choice of background colors, except to achieve clear distinctiveness, depends on
the message that the symbols should express to the users. A psychological perception
of the colors was taken into account. The different shapes for the categories aim to
avoid potential problems resulting from low light or black and white printing.
Each category has an individual letter code for easy identiﬁcation: A—disasters;
B—infrastructure; C—protection services and safety infrastructure; D—affected
people and infrastructure; and E—operational sites and activities. Each object and
its respective symbol have an alphanumeric code formed by the category code and
the serial number of the object in its category.
Figure 15.10 presents part of the symbol system, including the alphanumeric code,
graphic symbol and a brief description.
The status of objects in “infrastructure” and “protection services and safety infras-
tructure” in a crisis situation is represented by a combination of symbols in category
B (infrastructure) and category C (protection services and safety infrastructure), with
symbols representing destroyed, affected and unaffected objects of category D shown
in a reduced size (Fig. 15.11).
15.6.7.3
Maps for Disaster Protection
The new Symbol System for Disaster Management was applied in experimental
development of training maps supporting actions in emergencies and in a series of
maps for disaster protection at local and regional levels. The main tasks of local and
regional disaster protection plans are the analysis and assessment of disaster risks,
prevention and mitigation, early warning, and coordination of disaster management
activities. Participants in these activities need specialized geographic information to
support concrete actions.
The SSDM was applied in the production of base maps of the municipality of
Troyan, Bulgaria, at a scale of 1:50000 (Fig. 15.12) and Troyan at a scale of 1:10000
(Fig. 15.13). The maps were compiled according to predeﬁned elements of map
content and aim to support activities described in the disaster protection plan of the
municipality.
The main features of hydrography, settlements, infrastructure (including trans-
port, telecommunication, energy, manufacturing and water infrastructure) as well as
services and facilities related to disaster protection (such as hospitals, shelters, and
helicopter pads) are represented by the SSDM. Based on the main disaster protec-
tion maps, a series of maps for disaster management in case of earthquakes, ﬂoods,
ﬁre, and industrial accidents were created. Additional information was provided for

some features including the object name and description, number of beds in shelters,
dangerous industrial objects, type of stored materials, and ﬁre-ﬁghting equipment.
Infrastructure and services/facilities for protection are represented by the symbols
in Category B and Category C (Fig. 15.13). These maps also support predisaster
activities, including assessment and preparedness.
In a crisis situation base maps can be processed into rapid and reference maps pre-
senting the type and location of disaster(s) by adding symbols from Category A and
symbols for affected people and affected infrastructure in Category D (Fig. 15.14).
The symbols for operational sites and activities (Category E) could be useful for
damage assessment and recovery in the postdisaster stage.
The map content and displayed information of operational situations could help
support the responsible authorities and individuals to make timely and effective deci-
sions. Such maps could allow for identiﬁcation of the affected areas in municipalities
or regions, and provide signiﬁcant contributions to population protection, mitigation
and evacuation planning operations.
Cartography plays a key role in the main stages of disaster management. Efﬁcient
and cooperative preventive and protective activities of authorities require appropri-
ate and easily understood geographic information. The use of a standard system
of associative symbols can facilitate signiﬁcantly cooperative disaster management
strategies at local, regional and international levels.
15.7
Conclusion
Disaster mitigation and DRR are complicated processes, and solutions could be
improved by using powerful tools such as Digital Earth. The concept of DE covers
almost all activities occurring in ICT in the contemporary world. To be successful in
15
Digital Earth for Disaster Mitigation
523
employing the right solutions, we need to create improved concepts that consider the
newest knowledge about disaster mitigation and DRR. To realize this, we need well-
organized data and information such as in data ecosystems (as in the U.N. GGIM)
that reﬂect the complexity of the problems to be solved, deﬁned by the SDGs. Shar-
ing data and information, visualization with the help of digital maps, cartographic
models and their combinations hold important promise to support decision makers
and society with true and understandable outputs to help to comprehend situations,
to create instructions and standards on how to behave in various situations, and to
be ready when risks transform into disasters. This chapter highlighted the newest
projects, including the U.N. GGIM and DBAR. In the future, these approaches with
commonalities and differences should be developed to support smart solutions for
human society.

Digital City: An Urban Perspective
on Digital Earth
Davina Jackson and Richard Simpson
Abstract Digital Earth and many other satellite and semiconductor-enabled cartog-
raphy advances imply the need for a globally useful schema for more scientiﬁc and
eco-ethical management of cities. How should we plan an internationally cohesive
and locally effective system for understanding and managing urban stocks and ﬂows
around our planet? The answer to this question depends on new systems for manag-
ing geodata to underpin increasingly automated systems for evidence-based decision
making. The current concept of Digital Earth as a “self-aware nervous system” is
being advanced by urban proto-projects that are supported or followed by globally
applicable initiatives including Singapore’s new Geospatial Masterplan, the Interna-
tional Standards Organization’s City Standards, Denmark’s Open Public Life Data
Protocol, and the City-GML data model. These recent ventures are progressing a
movement that extends far beyond the 1990s concepts of “smart cities” enabled by
wireless telecommunications. In the Digital Earth science paradigm, cities must sim-
ulate their key situations and scenarios and analyze Earth observation data obtained
via satellite-enabled devices that remotely detect and interpret all the light and radio
waves of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Introduction: Satellites Meet Cities
The Digital Earth project (Gore 1992, 1999; Goodchild et al. 2012; Craglia et al.
2012; Jackson and Simpson 2012) is aligned with the intergovernmental program
for a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS was launched in 2005,
the same year as the online commercial globe Google Earth; Group on Earth Observa-
tions (GEO) 2007, 2015; Jackson and Simpson 2012). These and many other satellite

and semiconductor-enabled cartography advances imply the need to produce a glob-
ally useful schema for more scientiﬁc and eco-ethical management of cities (Ratti
and Claudel 2016). This aspect of Gore’s Digital Earth dream remains far from real-
ity and was promoted earlier by Richard Buckminster Fuller, beginning with his 4D
Air-Ocean World Town Plan concept diagram (Fuller 1928; Fig. 16.1), followed by
various urban synergetics proposals and prototypes. These contributed to his inﬂu-
ential late-career book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth (Fuller 1969), which
was published exactly ﬁfty years before this Manual of Digital Earth.
How should we design an internationally cohesive and locally effective system
for understanding and managing urban stocks and ﬂows around our planet? This
question requires comparisons and integrations of signiﬁcant concepts published
and prototyped by key scientists, technology innovators, architects and other leaders
of the urban informatics revolution; especially since Fuller died in 1983.
His original World Town Plan sketch was invented when “computers” were math-
ematically minded people, more than a decade before German engineer Konrad Zuse
invented the ﬁrst electromechanical, stored-program computing machine; his Model
Z3 was ﬁrst demonstrated in 1941. Fuller expired shortly after Time magazine named
“The Computer” instead of a human recipient for its annual “Man of the Year Award”
cover feature (Brosan and Segal 1982).

Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
529
Although his vision of an electronic infrastructure to operate Spaceship Earth was
inspired by radar and airplane autopilot systems, satellite navigation was not com-
mercialized widely for terrestrial vehicles until the early 1990s. Accompanying the
advent of GPS (global positioning system) devices linked to American NAVSTAR
satellites were magazine and newspaper reports forecasting commercialization of the
internet as a “new information superhighway” and revolutionary television and tele-
phony advances (Negroponte 1993, 1995; Gates 1995). Leading professors of town
planning and architecture expected computers to accelerate “smart cities” (Gibson
et al. 1992) and the MIT Smart Cities Lab was founded by William J. Mitchell in
2003. Other urban prophecies included “fractal cities” (Batty and Longley 1994),
the “city of bits” (Mitchell 1995) and “intelligent environments” (Droege 1997).
At the time of writing this chapter, the world’s main satellite navigation systems
were GPS (US), BeiDou (China), Galileo (Europe) and GLONASS (Russia; Hunter
and Hartcher 2019). We suggest that all of these 1990s terms emerged in response
to global commercialization of wireless and mobile telecom infrastructure—and
that this century’s Digital Earth and GEOSS planetary systems simulations vision
demands a new emphasis on the cruciality of satellite-enabled remote sensing data;
thus, we now use the term Data Cities when considering the urban aspects of Digital
Earth.
All of those end-of-century writers (and others before and since) highlighted
that “wireless” (actually extensively cabled) telecom technology was unlocking a
crucial new way to understand cities: not as static compositions of buildings and
streets but as dynamic, unpredictable and increasingly networked ﬂows of activity
and connections. However, until recently (Jackson 2018) there was little emphasis on
how satellites have become essential to what Batty called “a science of cities” (Batty
2005, 3; 2013) and Stephen Wolfram termed “a new kind of science” (Wolfram 2002)
that would interpret fractal and cellular automata principles of evolutionary growth
and behavior.
Satellites allow for today’s environmental scientists and designers to use increas-
ingly sophisticated machines and programs to monitor and simulate various pro-
cesses that Jay Forrester termed “urban dynamics” (Forrester 1969). City monitor-
ing and modeling are being accelerated by increasing numbers and constellations of
Earth-observing (EO) satellites, including squads of tiny CubeSats carrying minia-
ture remote sensing instruments. These include scanners and sensors to scrutinize
atmospheric and ocean conditions for meteorological and marine agencies (produc-
ing data that are visualized dramatically for television weather reports). They also
include many devices that use all the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum
to continually survey the world.
Earth observation methods such as SAR interferometry, GNSS reﬂectometry
(GNSS-R), radar altimetry and lidar sensing are revealing many structures and activ-
ities that normally cannot be viewed by humans or have been long obscured. Some
dramatic recent examples are digital heritage discoveries and detailed 3D mapping
of various ancient cities that were lost for centuries under tropical jungle foliage or
530
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
catastrophic ﬂoods. Specialists in digital archaeology can study early stone carvings
under thick coats of dirt and moss, and explore fabled burial grounds, perhaps without
touching a spade (Venkataramanan 2014).
For professionals developing and managing contemporary cities, satellite-enabled
land surveying has become vital to understanding existing circumstances with
unprecedented accuracy—allowing designers, decision makers and stakeholders to
share the same eyewitness evidence in discussions of proposals and problems.
To understand how satellite technology and data are being applied to solve today’s
environmental planning and management challenges, Davina Jackson (coauthor of
this chapter) devised a matrix diagram of ﬁve research themes and their ﬂow-on
priorities and projects in government, commerce and public sector contexts. Drafted
from 2008 to 2011, it was published in a GEO-sponsored snapshot report on the
scope of the GEOSS/Digital Earth project (Jackson and Simpson 2012, 5; Fig. 16.2).
All ﬁve research themes are being pursued concurrently towards the ideal of a global
model of complex environmental systems. They are natural systems modeling (NSM;
projects simulating certain area-deﬁned environmental behaviors), building informa-
tion modeling (BIM; creating virtual models of structures and testing the viability
and defects of each design before on-site construction), city information modeling
(CIM; 3D mapping, satellite and aerial imagery, remote sensing and data analyt-
ics at scales from street corners to megalopolises), virtual nations and networks
(VNN; data management and mapping the environmental conditions of countries,

multinational regions or continents—e.g., Virtual Singapore) and planetary systems
modeling (PSM; integrated 3D data mapping of environmental conditions around
the Earth).
All ﬁve scales of Earth observations and simulations must be integrated to achieve
the concept of a global EO system of systems but the diagram identiﬁed them sepa-
rately to reﬂect the reality that most researchers operate within speciﬁc professional
disciplines and domains of study (Fuller 1980). The following sections explain cur-
rent activities and recent projects that contribute to the integration of data and mod-
eling that is transforming urban development.
16.2
Global and Dynamic Data Mapping of Cities: A New
Cartography Paradigm
The Digital Earth vision and GEOSS program are both evolving through collabora-
tions between several hundred international governments, space agencies, science,
research and standards organizations, and United Nations entities (UN Global Mar-
ketplace n.d.). These groups are organizing different advances towards the system
of systems that has begun to allow users to access, analyze, visualize and exploit the
data collected by Earth observation instruments aboard or networked with satellites.
In this section, we identify how this system is being progressed in ways that may help
reform obsolete, insular and ecology-damaging practices by millions of inﬂuential
actors in urban development and city governance roles.
Today’s collaborations are underpinned by shared understandings of the impera-
tive to scientiﬁcally tackle the deadly impacts of climate change, including extreme
weather events (natural catastrophes), loss of biodiversity, rising sea levels, and
extreme heat and drought (UNDP n.d.). Two key UN bodies are leading the task
of broadly communicating information and strategies to deal with these wicked
problems: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which releases
ﬁve-yearly scientiﬁc reports recording the world’s environmental threats and perfor-
mance, and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which
organizes annual conventions where relevant organizations discuss, and participat-
ing governments agree, how they will reduce ecology-damaging practices in their
countries.
Another UN organization, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), globally
promotes seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) that include climate
action and sustainable cities and communities (UNDP n.d.) and other, mainly urban,
agendas. Its urban targets for 2030 include upgrading slums, increasing the resilience
of communities that are vulnerable to disasters, reducing the environmental impacts
of cities, improving air quality and waste management and providing affordable,
useful public transport and housing.
532
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
Certain places are evidently dangerous to occupy—ﬂood plains, ﬁre and earth-
quake zones, or countries prone to war. Vast land areas, especially deserts or polar
regions, are shunned because they seem inhospitably dry or frozen. Should they be
invigorated via hydro- and geo-engineering? This matter is being debated by ambi-
tious scientists and engineers through their academic and professional organizations.
Many properties near water—clifftop mansions on New York’s Long Island or
entire island states such as Tokelau and Nauru—risk subsidence and submersion
through the same forces (freak waves, storms and rising sea levels) that caused ancient
monumental cities such as Thonis (Egypt) and Harrapan (India) to slide into the sea.
Cyclones sometimes destroy popular resorts on South Paciﬁc islands and towns along
Asian coasts, and ﬁres seasonally burn through leafy suburbs in southeast Australia
and southern California. Residents of large hillside cities in Central America and
South America—like La Paz in Bolivia—understand that their homes suddenly might
slip down their slopes of clay. All these dangers appear to be escalating with the
global warming that Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius ﬁrst predicted in 1896. He
calculated that global temperatures would rise by 5 °C with the doubling of carbon
dioxide burned into the atmosphere. This prediction seems consistent with today’s
UN forecasting of a 5 °C temperature increase globally by 2050 (UNDP n.d.).
In Geneva, the International Centre for Earth Simulations (ICES Foundation)
archives scientiﬁc and press reports of environmental disasters on its website (Bishop
2018). Its articles from September 2017 to March 2018 included photographs of a
hotel tower falling after a Taiwan earthquake, bridges collapsing in Colombia and
Florida, homes buried under mudslides in southern California, a volcano erupting in
Bali and Hurricane Irma battering Caribbean countries and Miami. ICES, led by Bob
Bishop, a scientist expert in high-performance, real-time computer simulations, aims
to establish an advanced computing facility in Switzerland for modeling complex
environmental systems. His foundation offers a worldwide QLARM message service
that promptly predicts and maps likely building damage and human casualties after
earthquakes (Wyss n.d.). More than 1000 alerts have been issued since 2002 using
geological data from the Swiss Seismological Service, settlement records from the
World Housing Encyclopedia and population statistics. ICES also completed earth-
quake vulnerability studies of Haiti (for the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs)
and Kyrgyzstan (for Médecins Sans Frontièrs).
In recent lectures, Bishop analyzed the challenges and potential for building
“an open, integrated, wholistic model of Planet Earth for decision support, disaster
reduction and public good”—the same vision as the GEOSS, Gore’s 1990s Digital
Earth and Fuller’s 1960s Spaceship Earth. He warned that quantities of data—mostly
unstructured data—are growing far faster than global computing power—and that
both are insufﬁcient to crunch solutions for the world’s many serious environmental
and sociopolitical threats. He predicted that, as well as quantum computing systems,
global simulations projects will ultimately be improved by neuromorphic comput-
ing to imitate information processing by human brains. Recent projects to develop
neuromorphic chips include TrueNorth by IBM, SpiNNaker by Manchester Univer-
sity and BrainScaleS, initiated by Heidelberg University. The two academic ventures

upgrade today’s energy-guzzling computers built with von Neumann architectures
(Modha n.d.). Bishop (a former chair of the HBP advisory panel) suggested that,
while these computing capacity ambitions are being pursued, current projects can
reduce energy consumption by installing processor-in-memory (PIM) technologies
to use big data, preferably without moving it. While computer architectures would
be global, the data should be applied to solve local urban and regional problems.
European scientists recently published the ﬁrst sophisticated satellite mapping of
the world’s human settlements, depicting four decades of population statistics and
machine-analyzed Landsat data, including some information on building heights,
footprints and materials. Launched in 2012 as the Global Human Settlement Layer
(GHSL dataset for GEOSS; Pesaresi et al. 2016), this project is included in the GEO
Human Planet initiative that was announced at the 2016 United Nations Habitat III
conference on settlements. As well as identifying several major new cities in Asia
that were not UN-recorded, it applied astrospatial (developed for space exploration),
geomatics (terrestrial monitoring) and telematics systems to the formerly paper-
centric domains of land surveying, cartography, architecture and town planning.
Outstanding 3D and 4D visualizations of the GHSL data, depicted as “population
mountains”, were produced by Alasdair Rae (Rae 2016, 2018) and Matt Daniels
(Daniels 2018a, b).
The ﬁrst example of global 3D video-mapping of urban population (including
growth) statistics was Japan’s PopulouSCAPE project, which included a 10-minute
Night Flight Over an Urbanizing World, providing aerial views of cities as surging
towers of population (visualizing UN Figures) and intercity transport and commu-
nications connections (Ito et al. 2005; Team PopulouSCAPE 2005). Another his-
torically signiﬁcant example of planet-scale modeling of cities was the Pulse of the
Planet real-time video visualization of AT&T data recording telephone and internet
trafﬁc between New York and other cities. Produced by a Carlo Ratti-led team at
MIT’s SENSEable City Lab, it was shown in the Design and Elastic Mind exhibition
at New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MIT SENSEable City Lab 2008). These
two projects were perhaps history’s ﬁrst world-scale depictions of the data cities
movement (Jackson 2008; Jackson and Simpson 2012)—following some important
mid-2000s video simulations of speciﬁc cities such as the Virtual London model
(showing ﬂood and shadow simulations) by University College London’s Centre
for Advanced Spatial Analysis (2002–2005) and the Real-Time Rome mobile phone
data-mapping show at the Venice Biennale by MIT’s SENSEable Cities Lab (2006).
One notable new world urban mapping project is the Global Urban Footprint
(GUF), led by Thomas Esch’s team at the Earth Observation Center of the German
Space Agency (DLR, Fig. 16.3). Scatters of tiny black dots show settlement patterns
with unprecedented detail and precision, using radar data from the TerraSAR-X and
TanDEM-X pair of satellites operated by the DLR and Airbus Space and Defence.
Although only depicted in 2D, the GUF shows the global distribution of human settle-
ments with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.4 arcsec (~12 m), using 180,000
satellite scenes expressed in grayscale: black dots for urban areas, white for land
and gray for water (DLR n.d.; Fig. 16.4). This instantly informative data visualiza-
tion (seen on-screen via a swirling sphere) refreshes the adage that new technology

paradigms (such as 3D time-series video-mapping) are not the only, or always the
best, tool for communicating speciﬁc information in certain circumstances. As an
obvious example, audio remains preferable to video when people are walking or
driving cars.
16.3
Global Advances in Computer Design, Analysis
and Construction
This section highlights ﬁve signiﬁcant advances in data modeling solutions for major
challenges in designing and managing built environments.
16.3.1
Environmental Performance Control Envelopes
New Zealand’s Resource Management Act, passed in 1991, was ground-breaking
legislation for the nation to conserve and sustainably manage its natural resources:
land, air and water. It was underpinned by one of the world’s ﬁrst cases of using
architectural computer modeling (then known as CAD, computer-aided drawing,
now updated as BIM, building information modeling) to pretest the potential envi-
ronmental impacts of new building proposals. Approval by a New Zealand court of
law for uses of 3D computer models as evidence was ﬁrst granted for the appeal of a
planning decision that delayed construction of Auckland’s Sky Tower. As the tallest
freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere, Sky Tower was a radical depar-
ture from the city’s conservative urban landscape and would not have been publicly
acceptable without using computer simulation and 3D visualization to articulate the
regulatory, design and environmental impacts (Fig. 16.4).
Before the Resource Management Act, basic prescriptive rules were used by
NZ planning authorities to maintain unimpeded sunlight for speciﬁc open spaces.
This approach was reﬁned during the years after the 1987 stock market crash, when
city property values slumped. In 1988, the Auckland City Council commissioned
Cadabra, an applied computer graphics consultancy led by Richard Simpson (coau-
thor of this chapter) to develop one of the world’s ﬁrst performance-based 3D virtual
city models to allow for patterns of sunlight to be more speciﬁcally and accurately
simulated.
Cadabra’s approach was to calculate an overarching operative control envelope
(OCE) for the central city. This performance-based envelope was generated from
an accurate 3D terrain model of the city, including twenty-seven designated public
places (mostly parks) that were to maintain access to sunlight and views. The sunlight
controls for these places were evaluated for every moment of the year to determine
the overall impact that each would have on the city height limits. The result was a
set of twenty-seven envelopes that intersected in complex and dramatic ways in 3D
536
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
and 4D space above the virtual city skyline. The overarching operative envelope was
determined by overlaying all the place-speciﬁc envelopes and deﬁning the combined
surface minimum to deﬁne the OCE.
This operative surface had the appearance of an exaggerated rugged terrain in the
sky. It deﬁned a “battle” between ground-based controls. In one place, one control
might have a sweeping inﬂuence on the height of a potential new building, then would
be overridden by another control. The hilly nature of the inner city, protection criteria,
and eclectic formats of park boundaries all contributed to this complex expression
through controls on the generated operative envelope. Visually, this model appeared
like a paint-by-number on a wildly rumpled canvas.
The operative envelope was visualized as a contour plot of heights above a datum.
The model enabled performance-based sculpting of the city’s urban envelope and
regeneration of the individual sunlight controls to ensure solar irradiation for any
place for speciﬁc periods of the year and times of day. It was also rendered in 3D
with proposed and existing 3D CAD models of buildings. If a building complied
with the control, it would be visually obvious as it would not breach the envelope.
The rendering treated each control as a differently colored “stained glass” window
and thereby visualized the volumetric inﬂuences of controls in the airspace and
throughout any day. Colored light for a speciﬁc control might ﬂood the ground to
clearly show the inﬂuence of any speciﬁc control through a day or year.
The ﬁnal design of Auckland’s OCE was published as a set of regulatory con-
tour maps in the 1991 district scheme. This work deﬁned the aesthetic balance and
shape of Auckland’s skyline and enabled a paradigm shift from obsolete prescrip-
tive controls to more evidence-precise and context-responsive performance controls.
The modeling removed legal ambiguities and provided more clarity and certainty for
citizens to enjoy maximum sunlight and views when using public spaces.

Geodesign
In 2001, Pascal Mueller, then a postgraduate student at ETH-Zurich’s Future Cities
Lab, introduced CityEngine, a procedural modeling program to rapidly generate and
modify basic forms of buildings in urban scenes. It offered designers ﬂexibility to
changetheheightsandﬂoorplatesofspeciﬁcbuildingsontheﬂy,usingprocessscripts
ratherthantheprescriptionsofparametricmodeling.Whencommerciallylaunchedin
2008,itcouldgeneratearealistic3Donline(ﬂythrough)depictionofVenice’sGothic-
Byzantine building stock in a few minutes. Users could transform the heights and
areas of one or various buildings, and simulate shadows cast at different times of day
and year. Since 2011, CityEngine has been owned and updated by Esri, the world’s
largest commercial GIS mapping software supplier, to integrate with its formerly
ofﬂine and 2D (pre-Google Earth) suite of ArcGIS mapping tools. Esri’s transition
to online 3D dynamic modeling and what-if design tools, and its SYMAP-derived
16

topographical data mapping, catalyzed a new educational-promotional venture that
the company’s founder, Jack Dangermond, launched with the name Geodesign in
2010 (Steinitz 2012, 2013; De Monchaux 2016).
Until recently, the GIS packages needed by surveyors and land-planning profes-
sionals have been used separately from the building design (BIM and CAD) programs
required by architects and building engineers. However, some surveying ﬁrms such
as Britain’s Severn Partnership are marketing “Scan2BIM” skills to provide point
clouds of 3D laser-scanned, geotagged data about existing buildings and landscapes,
giving precise bases for modeling structural alterations. Another example is the Ther-
malMapper project in Bremen, where Dorrit Borrmann and Andreas Nüchter from
Jacobs University recorded a 360° aerial point cloud of the city square with temper-
ature data from nine thermal images overlaid on eleven 40° laser-scanned poses of
the historic buildings, plaza and streets. They used a Riegl VZ-400 3D laser scanner
and an Optris PI infrared camera, with the pose ﬁles calculated using 3DTK based
on odometry information (Borrmann and Nüchter n.d., Fig. 16.5).
In 2017, Autodesk and Esri announced a new collaboration to integrate their build-
ing design and environmental data modeling tools. Patrick Janssen, with the Singa-
pore ETH Future Cities Lab, was skeptical that this partnership would resolve all
Fig. 16.5 ThermoRathaus, a point cloud of Bremen’s city square, overlaid with temperature data
from a thermal imaging camera (Borrmann and Nüchter, Jacobs University)
538
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
the aspirations of architects but recognized opportunities to resolve signiﬁcant deﬁ-
ciencies in Esri’s GIS and Autodesk’s BIM and graphics packages. Janssen praised
GIS software for providing data online and downloadable in tiles and criticized BIM
programs for not providing online access to data and ﬁne-grain imagery. He said
advanced architects were eager for open semantics, “where you can compute your
own stuff”; a capability now available to some extent in Houdini but likely to be more
prevalent soon with new developers using Amazon Web Services or Web Assembly
(Wasm). He said that most sophisticated modeling programs remain too complex in
their structural routines—generating too many links and nodes in their data graphics.
He was developing a new online geometrical design application, Vidamo, which he
expected to be more efﬁcient and more comprehensible for users without advanced
programming skills (Jackson 2018, 37).
At the 2018 Geodesign Summit, Dangermond’s presentation emphasized “the sci-
ence of where” as being crucial for “understanding and managing our world” through
“integrating people, processes, things and data about them” via three types of infor-
mation infrastructure: records, insights and engagement. He also highlighted three
major groups of trends that would evolve WebGIS during coming decades (and which
are applicable to other types of software needed for urban planning and design). For
professionals concerned with data, relevant advances include drones, lidar, scientiﬁc
measurements, real-time video, crowdsourcing and much more detailed information
on trafﬁc, demographics, weather and locations. For experts developing computer
infrastructure, he highlighted mobile communications, big data, machine learning,
distributed computing, SaaS (software as a service), the IoT (Internet of Things),
cloud storage and parallel computing, web services, microservices and networks.
For GIS innovation, he focused on “expanding the power” via advanced analytics,
open APIs, dynamic image processing, online content, apps, 3D modeling and smart
mapping, data exploration, hubs, real-time visualization, Python programming and
portals (Dangermond 2018).
As a corporation led by landscape architecture graduates from Harvard, Esri is
focused on how to use computer tools to eco-sensitively integrate buildings and urban
infrastructure with natural environments. Echoing three of the ﬁve research themes
identiﬁed in Jackson’s 2007 GEOSS-DE network diagram (Jackson and Simpson
2012, 5; Fig. 16.2), Dangermond identiﬁed four main types of modeling that should
be increasingly integrated: landscape information models (LIMs; another term for
natural systems modeling), building information models (BIMs), city information
models (CIMs) and zoning information models (ZIMs; a CIM subset of particular
value to government planners; Dangermond 2018).
16.3.3
Digital Engineering and Digital Twinning Standards
Also called virtual engineering, digital engineering is a shorthand reference to the
consistent use of digital methods and tools throughout product development and pro-
duction processes to improve planning quality and process controls over an asset’s
16
Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
539
entire life cycle. Digital twinning involves modeling and simultaneously sustain-
ing all the virtual systems associated with a physical entity. These terms emerged
with computer modeling and autopiloting systems developed for aerospace, ship and
car manufacturing and operations. Now these labels have transferred to BIM and
geospatial environmental modeling—which evolved from different 2D paradigms
(CAD drawing and GIS mapping) that depend on different methods of structuring
data.
To establish interoperability, the buildingSMART International (bSI) group and
the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) established a joint working group in 2017
to prepare a roadmap towards a global standards framework named the Integrated
Digital Built Environment (IDBE). BSI administers Open BIM standards, including
Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs), and the OGC administers OpenGIS, includ-
ing geospatial data interoperability, and the Reference Model and GML standards.
The IDBE is intended to underpin digital engineering and enable digital twinning
of physical conditions with corresponding records held in digital repositories. The
physical twin may be represented in the digital twin (virtual model) at any level of
detail (LOD). However, there are new moves beyond formerly prescriptive notions
of LOD to a more agile, performance-based, level of information needed (LOIN)
approach, which speciﬁes why data are required, what speciﬁc data are required,
when they are required, and who is responsible for the transfers and uses.
16.3.4
Astrospatial Architecture
Architecture’s ancient history switched tones around the turn of the third millen-
nium. In May 2000, Aaron Betsky published Architecture Must Burn, a critique of
late-twentieth century architectural culture and a “manifesto for architecture beyond
building” (Betsky and Adigard 2000). This book preceded, by just eighteen months,
the explosions that collapsed America’s twin towers of modern capitalism, the World
Trade Center, in September 2011. Five months later, Manhattan architects Diller
Scoﬁdio+Renfro revealed an unprecedented anti-icon: the Blur pavilion, a wide
cloud of clean water vapor hovering low across Lake Neuchâtel during the 2002
Swiss National Expo. Solar-powered and with sensors dotted across its fog-obscured
steelwork, this work symbolized two novel impulses: to evaporate architecture’s anti-
quated focus on merely crafting static structures using weighty materials dug from
the Earth and to steam-clean a world remaining stubbornly reliant on carbon-belching
fossil fuels.
Blur catalyzed a post-internet design movement that was later named astrospatial
architecture (Jackson 2016). Protagonists now intend to design extraordinary com-
positions of solids and voids and devise memorable interpretations and experiences
via light and data. For example, in 2011 Joseph Paradiso’s Responsive Environ-
ments group at MIT’s Media Lab revealed perhaps the world’s ﬁrst video simulation
of invisible atmospheric dynamics inside a building—using temperature, humidity,
540
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
light, sound, human movement and other data, streaming from RFID and other sen-
sors around ﬂoors of the real building. Visualized with the Unity game engine, the
DoppelLab showed how space pulsates with unseen information (Paradiso 2011).
Architectural technology has evolved from computer-aided drawing (CAD) tools
(beginning with light pens drawn on tiny screens in the late 1950s) to BIMs that are
derived from aerospace engineering software and can script algorithms to operate
fabrication machinery such as 3D printers and construction robots. Professors lead-
ing this international revolution tend to be involved in three overlapping design
movements: Parametricism (Schumacher 2008), Smartgeometry (Smartgeometry
n.d.; Peters and Peters 2013) and the more recent Advanced Architectural Geometry
(AAG) group (Adriaenssens et al. 2016).
Building models created in programs such as Autodesk’s BIM360 or Revit, or
Trimble’s Tekla BIMsight or Connect, can be exported for viewing with head-
sets using plug-ins such as Modelo, Prospect, Enscape, Umbra or AUGmentecture.
Another capability was demonstrated by Greg LynnFORM at the 2016 Biennale of
Architecture in Venice, where Lynn and his team used Microsoft HoloLens goggles
and augmented reality (AR) software to compare multiple holographic scale models
of the Tate Modern building in London with a physical scale model of a giant former
car plant in Detroit (Fig. 16.6). HoloLens wearers could look inside the physical
model and walk around full-scale virtual rooms deﬁned by lines of ephemeral light.
The team also highlighted and overlaid the history of the building being redesigned
and showed different road and aerial vehicles ﬂowing around the site (Jackson 2018,
19–20).
Beyond the design studio, VR, AR and nonimmersive 360° viewing systems are
valuable tools for the property industry (Stanley 2017). They help clarify building
proposals to stakeholders inﬂuencing council development approvals. They help
in marketing buildings and apartments prior to completion or to inform remotely
located investors. For example, spherical imagery captured by drones can clarify
views from different ﬂoor levels of an unbuilt tower. The industry expects continuous

541
improvements to VR and AR experience kits and 360° cameras over the coming
decade. Better graphics (pixel densities and spatial resolutions), audio, haptics (more
touch-sensitive handset interfaces), and tracking speeds are still needed.
Another way to represent architecture and cities is with holographic images. These
are data-coded recordings of light ﬁelds (waves of particles scattered off illuminated
objects). Like sound recordings, holographic recordings can be reproduced later—
but usually with considerable loss of ﬁdelity, so the representations seem ethereal.
Virtual building and city models can also be converted into 3D holographic imagery
printed on ﬁlm. When illuminated from above, these renditions seem to pop in three
dimensions from their glossy sheets. If not precisely lit and viewed, holographic
images appear spectral and chromatically fragmented.
Holographic glasses and headsets underpin augmented reality (AR)—a domain
alternatively named “metasensory augmentation” by wearable computing visionary
Steve Mann. At MIT in 1978, he prototyped the ﬁrst AR spectacles, Digital Eye
Glass, and later versions could be ﬁnger-tapped to convey holographic data. Those
precedents inspired Google’s Glass smart specs (sold generally from 2013 to 2015),
Microsoft’s HoloLens system (launched 2016) and the Vuzix Blade smart glasses
(previewed in 2018, Statt 2018). The HoloLens has been surpassed technically by
another of Mann’s creations, Metavision’s Meta 2 visor, released to Unity game
developers in late 2017.
LiFi (light ﬁdelity) is another emerging technology expected to energize built
environments. Demonstrated by Harald Haas in a TED talk in 2011, a LiFi system
uses the semiconductors of LED lamps (such as downlights) to transmit data (Haas
2015). In some early tests, LiFi networks transferred data at much faster speeds than
is currently possible over WiFi networks conducting low-frequency radio waves and
microwaves. This is because LiFi uses the higher frequencies and bandwidths that
come from the visible light, infrared and near-ultraviolet waves that share the mid-
range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since Haas and his partner Mostafa Algani
set up the pureLiFi company to commercialize his discoveries, several dozen star-
tups and corporations have begun developing LiFi applications using next-generation
LEDs with signal processing capabilities. In Dubai, Zero 1 used LED streetlights for
networking data—exploiting pre-Haas research on urban transport-logistics telem-
atics. In Dresden, the Fraunhofer IPMS research center has developed industrial
automation solutions for several corporations. All major electronics manufacturers—
General Electric, Panasonic, Samsung, Philips, Osram, Qualcomm and Cree—are
racing to market with LiFi data-and-light product suites.
People in polar countries often feel depressed by the long nights of winter—need-
ing treatment with mood-elevating colors and wavelengths of light. This afﬂiction,
called seasonal affective disorder (SAD), seems to emerge from changes to a body’s
circadian rhythm and serotonin and melatonin hormone levels. Some local govern-
ments in near-Arctic latitudes encourage their citizens to take therapy sessions and
cheer their communities with winter light festivals (that also magnetise tourism).
From 2012 to 2016, Oslo artists Christine Istad and Lisa Pacini responded to SAD
in Norwegian towns (where there is no daylight during January) by trucking around
a night sun—a 3 m-diameter circular panel crusted with hundreds of color-changing
542
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
LEDs (Anon 2013). A popular, three-dimensional, night sun is Rafael Lozano-
Hemmer’s Solar Equation aerostat (helium balloon), which is video-mapped with
layers of computer-generated imagery and data derived from NASA’s sun-monitoring
instruments (Fig. 16.7). These are just two examples of creative urban (outdoor)
applications advancing this century’s revolution in ‘electroluminescent’ technology,
based on semi-conductor controls of electric pulses (Neumann and Champa 2002;
Jackson 2015).
16.3.5
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence was ignored by most built environment professionals until
the internet caused widespread apprehensions during the 1990s, systemic disruption
during the 2000s, and now, inevitably, new ways of understanding and doing things.
Today, AI brings another wave of unfamiliar technologies and terms—including
augmented intelligence, where machines are intended to improve human abilities to
decide and perform. This seems less threatening than artiﬁcial intelligence, where
machines are presumed to increasingly replace humans to a tipping point that Ray
Kurzweil termed the Singularity (Kurzweil 2005).

Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
543
All intelligence, artiﬁcial or natural, ﬂows from competent processing of infor-
mation. Most AI researchers have abandoned their early reliance on preprogrammed
rules to solve problems. Instead, they are evolving machine learning, where comput-
ers use statistical learning algorithms to gradually teach themselves how to intelli-
gently process big data. The more data that computers are given, the more capably
they can perform complex tasks; partly through their supra-human powers of pattern
recognition (New Scientist 2017).
Dacheng Tao at the University of Sydney has developed a classiﬁcation sys-
tem to help understand different concepts, methods and challenges that are being
advanced in AI and robotics. His taxonomy highlights four basic functions per-
formed by machines: perceiving, learning, reasoning and behaving. Devices fueled
by data from sensors and cameras must perform one or more of these functions to
help solve humanity’s ultra-wicked problem of how to sensibly manage our planet.
Machine learning is a new ﬁeld that is being divided into different specialties:
unsupervised learning (training machines to identify untagged images), supervised
learning (training using labeled or annotated information), reinforcement learning
(training via rewards for correct actions) and deep learning (using complex neural
networks). Neural networks are software circuits inspired by ﬂows of information
throughhumanbrains.Theycandelivergeneralartiﬁcialintelligence(solvingvarious
tasks) or narrow AI (expertise in one or two speciﬁc tasks).
One of the most promising potentials in AI is for robots to replace humans in
performing extremely dangerous tasks: such as exploring nuclear power plants after
an explosion, entering narrow cavities to replace damaged wiring or recording stress
points in unstable structures. Czech writer Karel ˇCapek ﬁrst coined the term robot in
his 1921 play R. U. R: Rossum’s Universal Robots, and today’s humanoid versions
such as Boston Dynamics’ Atlas and Honda’s Asimo are agile and realistic. Most of
Boston’s robots, being developed with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency (DARPA), emulate ﬂeet-footed animals and are intended to replace soldiers
on topographically rugged battleﬁelds. Swiveling, ﬁxed-footed robots (mounted on a
ﬂoor or ceiling) canprint small masonrydomestructures andassembletimber-framed
houses (Jackson 2018, 42–48; Kohler et al. 2014).
Researchers developing computer vision systems are evolving improved ways
for cameras, sensors and software to detect, recognize and track moving objects,
including people, analyze environments by segmenting items of interest in changing
scenes, estimate distances between cameras and objects in view, and enhance the
clarity of images. Face-detection software can discern and frame almost every head
in crowds of thousands. Any newly scanned face can be matched instantly with
the same face from a digital archive. Data analysts can also clarify blurry, hazy,
too-dark, wrongly colored and low-resolution images using smarter versions of the
photoenhance tools found on standard laptops and smartphones. As these perception
technologies improve, CCTV is becoming all-pervasive, with predictable reductions
of both public crime and personal privacy.
Machine vision scientists depend on open-source datasets comprising images of
objects that are classiﬁed and labeled to allow for comparisons with new images
containing similar objects. The world’s largest object dataset, ImageNet, contains
544
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
more than 14 million crowd-labeled thumbnails, which can be downloaded to help
identify different types of natural places, buildings, rooms, products such as fridges
or dishwashers, furniture, fabrics, clothes, and apparel such as hats or sunglasses.
Vision experts classify database images according to whether they depict “things”
(box-frameable objects such as chairs, people or windows) or “stuff” (matter with
no clear boundaries such as a patch of sky, an ofﬁce corridor, a wall, a hillside or a
street) (Stanford Vision Lab 2016).
Ironically, the image databases now being assembled to support AI analytics all
depend on the “artiﬁcial artiﬁcial intelligence” (i.e., the non-electronic knowledge of
humans working online) to label and cross-check the images uploaded by database
compilers. One busy conduit is Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) portal, which
matches employers (such as public research groups) with freelancers to contribute to
speciﬁc human intelligence tasks (HITs). One recent HIT, to assemble and correctly
label 328,000 thumbnail images of “common objects in context” for the Microsoft
COCO dataset, required 70,000 h of work by Microsoft-funded AMT participants
(Lin et al. 2015).
Cameras and scanners capture images that can be analyzed, compared and manip-
ulated, increasingly automatically and accurately. Some powerful processes are
becoming common practices for owners and managers of major buildings and public
places. For example, different faces, facial expressions, poses and walking gaits can
be transferred or morphed between source videos featuring one or more people and
“target” videos involving other people. Security cameras can detect licence plates and
simultaneously track clusters of moving vehicles, even at night. All these observation
systems are being integrated gradually with trafﬁc lights, smartpoles and building
heating, ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems.
Data networks underpin the sensing and imaging infrastructure that is necessary
to deliver key goals for the Global Earth Observation System of Systems. These
include improving urban and disaster resilience; public health; energy, mineral and
water resource management; infrastructure and transport systems; food security and
agriculture, and healthy, biodiverse ecosystems. These domains overlap—integration
of information and technology solutions is the main point of the GEOSS.
Caution pervaded a recent editorial for Environment and Planning B, in which
Michael Batty warned readers not to expect too much sophisticated intelligence
from “intelligent” machines. He said that machine learning through highly repeti-
tive schemes of pattern recognition is “not much more than sophisticated averaging”
but because machines could rapidly process vast quantities of data, they would con-
tinue to be useful for automated tasks such as monitoring and prediction of energy
uses, delivery of location-based services, and transport. He suggested that machines
would not be capable of replacing humans in planning long-term development of
cities because they could not compute “the hard choices” of how a city functions
economically and is organized in terms of social equity. He suggested both explo-
ration of the limits of AI in understanding cities and “a concerted effort” by planners
to invent new ways of automating urban functions (Batty 2018).

Some Recent Urban and Regional Case Studies
with Global Potential
This section highlights seven projects and research groups that have advanced urban
environmental simulations with methods that could be applied in many other cases
and places.
16.4.1
MIT Media Lab Projects, United States
Carlo Ratti’s SENSEable City Lab worked with government leaders in Cambridge,
MassachusettstoprototypetheCityScanner projecttoacquireweatherandairquality

Sustainable Design Lab developed an urban modeling interface (umi) program that

being studied is architecturally modeled in Rhino 3D, and then the model is analyzed
for walkability, daylighting and several types of energy consumption (Fig. 16.8).
Kent Larson’s City Science group is continuing its CityScope project to model
city precincts using color-coded Lego bricks, which are sensor-tagged and plotted
on screens as data units. Users rapidly move the data bricks to reveal different ways

to improve the density, proximity to services, and demographic diversity (vibrancy)
of each area. City Science researchers have also prototyped ingenious “mobility on
demand” (MOD) solutions. Their latest persuasive electric vehicle (PEV) can drive
autonomously, even following its human passengers slowly if they decide to walk
themselves; can be driven in bike lanes without the driver requiring a vehicle license;
could be suitable for public sharing and can move both people and goods. In another
project,LarsonandHasierLarreashowedhowﬁvehundredpeoplecouldbehousedin
a medium-rise block of 25 sqm “action apartments” with the same footprint as forty-
ﬁve conventional car spaces. Since graduation, Larrea has established a company,
Ori, to make and sell these robotically mobile furniture suites.
16.4.2
Almere 2030, the Netherlands
In the Netherlands, one of a few countries noted for consistent innovations in urban
spatial planning, architects MVRDV (Maas van Rijs de Vries) designed a 2030 vision
plan to help the municipality of Almere plan polycentric growth on 250 sq km of
polder land reclaimed in the 1960s (Fig. 16.9). The terrain is three meters lower
than the water level of the adjacent IJseelmeer (lake) so Almere is constantly at risk
of ﬂooding, protected by a system of dykes and sluices. MVRDV’s plan, gradu-
ally underway now, contradicted the popular Western strategy of transport-oriented
development (TOD), where high-rise apartment buildings are clustered around subur-
ban metro stations and new ribbons of low-to-medium-rise housing and commercial
development are encouraged along main bus routes and rail lines.
Fig. 16.9 MVRDV masterplan for four “carpet cities” at Almere, the Netherlands
16
Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
547
Instead, MVRDV proposed four “carpet cities”. IJ-Land, designed with California
architect William McDonough, will be a series of new island nature reserves in the
lake, including 5–10,000 homes. Pampus will be a high-density, medium-rise vil-
lage of 20,000 partly ﬂoating homes, with all streets leading to a lakefront boulevard.
Almere Centre will extend the current city center with development of Almere Flori-
ade, a compact and ultragreen neighborhood intended to be the horticultural campus
for the World Expo in 2022. The public arboretum will contain 1,600 new homes,
ofﬁces and facilities. In Oosterwold (Freeland), the ﬁrst residents have begun to build
their own neighborhood, with up to 15,000 new homes to be set in agricultural ﬁelds
east of central Almere (MVRDV 1999, 2007, n.d.).
16.4.3
Jade Eco Park, Taiwan, China
French architect Philippe Rahm redesigned an obsolete airport in Taichung to provide
a “meteorological” recreation landscape, Jade Eco Park, where vegetation and paths
are interrupted by freestanding structures comprising white pipes, air ducts, sensors,
ﬁlters and other electronic devices (Fig. 16.10). These were designed to mitigate
Taichung’s generally hot, humid climate and air pollution: they blow cool breezes,
release mists or patches of rain, or clean local air to generate three types of artiﬁcial
and contained atmospheric experiences: Coolia (four cool zones), Clearia (four areas
of clean air) and Dria (three areas of dry air). Rahm’s team ﬁrst monitored and mapped
the existing temperatures, humidity and air pollution conditions across the site and
then used computational ﬂuid dynamics to create an atmospherics map of the site. The
Fig. 16.10 Illustration of clean, cool and dry atmospheres generated across the Jade Eco Park in
Taipei, designed by a team led by Philippe Rahm

new atmospheric zones overlap each other to allow for different sensory experiences
to be selected at different times of day or during the year (Jackson 2018, 54; Rahm
n.d.).
16.4.4
Nocturnal Barcelona, Spain
In Barcelona, the “datatecture” studio 300.000 km/s (speed of light) mapped the
city’s current and potential night-lighting of streets and public squares in a 2017
report for the city council’s Municipal Institute of Urban Landscape and Quality
of Life (Fig. 16.11). The project included analyses and visualizations of data on
mobility, citizens’ activities and business types in each location. The report also
included comparison pairs of day and night photographs of city scenes, a satellite
image of light pollution and the city’s lighting regulations.

16.4.5
Spatial Information Management Platform, Australia
Cities are complex, adaptive systems (CAS), where various dynamic systems evolve
in interdependent ways. To “digitally twin” (computer-simulate) a city successfully
in the Digital Earth context, this complexity needs to be represented accurately within
the digital framework. Each component of the model must be able to evolve inde-
pendently of the whole. Any viable CAS invariably evolved from a simple system
that worked. Any complex system designed from scratch typically fails and cannot
be repaired.
Modeling the behaviors of real-world complex systems with counterpart digital
systems deepens our knowledge and improves our control of real-world scenarios.
Recent projects undertaken by a Brisbane geospatial planning consultancy, Meta
Moto, have adopted a CAS framework so that complementary systems of record,
engagement, and insight can interact through a common semantic ecosystem support-
ing master data management and spatial data transformation functions. By adhering
to open standards and exchange formats, the complementary systems can be made
agnostic to one another. For example, graphics library transmission format (glTF) is a
royalty-free speciﬁcation for the efﬁcient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and
models by applications. This format deﬁnes the sizes of 3D assets and the runtime
processing needed to unpack and use those assets. It deﬁnes an extensible, common
publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring work-
ﬂows and enables interoperable use of content across systems of engagement (such
as web base viewers). Adopting this as a pipeline within a CAS framework ensures
that the uses determine the engagement tools, and the semantic data model drives the
user experience and presentation of the data in these tools. This approach removes
the risks of vendor lock-in and ensures that the system has continuous opportunities
to evolve. Meta Moto recently used glTF for data visualizations supporting Bris-
bane’s Cross River Rail project and the next-generation spatial platform for South
East Water in Melbourne (Fig. 16.12).

Greening Greater Bendigo, Australia
Bendigo, a regional city of 100,000 people in central Victoria, Australia, recently
began to use EO imagery from Europe’s Sentinel satellites to regularly monitor
changes of vegetation around its towns and suburbs. A Melbourne landscape con-
sultancy, Ofﬁce of Other Spaces, analyzed sixteen multispectral Earth observation
images (captured at 10 m resolution and stacked as a time-series ‘data cube’) to
monitor seasonal and area-speciﬁc changes in vegetation throughout the city during
the summer from December 2018 to February 2019. This pilot project allowed the
city council to create new a vegetation cover benchmark (named the consolidated

Water, Victoria
mean value, CMV) to clarify the measure of its vegetation cover and determine
any site-speciﬁc risks of new building developments destroying existing vegetation
(Fig. 16.13).

Happy, Smelly and Chatty Maps, Britain
Computer scientists with the Cambridge node of the Nokia-Bell Labs network are
advancing a Good City Life program that is intended to support happier citizens—not
necessarily the prevailing corporate-governance agenda of ‘smart’ (time- and cost-
efﬁcient) cities (Aiello et al. 2016; Quercia et al. 2016). Led by Daniele Quercia, the
Bell-Cambridge social dynamics team has been surveying, analyzing and mapping
how people are enjoying—or could better enjoy—the sights, smells, sounds and other
atmospheric experiences of public places that they navigate regularly (Fig. 16.14).
With other computer scientists at Yahoo Labs in London, and with the Universi-
ties of Turin and Shefﬁeld, they analyzed diverse social media tags and developed
sophisticated algorithms which allow users of mobile devices to generate naviga-
tion routes on their GPS map apps (initially tested via OpenStreetMaps for speciﬁc
zones of London and Barcelona). The paths they calculate are usually longer than
the quickest journeys but can provide happier scenes, smells and sounds along the

ment ofﬁcials tend to focus on unpleasant odors and acoustics (signaling air or noise
pollution) and mostly ignore desirable smells and sounds.
16.5
Urban Criteria, Process and Standards Taxonomies
and Platforms
Many of the world’s most intelligent and experienced urban professionals are not
digital natives, sometimes refer to themselves as Luddites, and still use hand-inked
diagrams, lists, tables and grammatical sentences to express their ideas. Some of these
thought-leaders have devised schema for systems that could someday be programmed
to analyze development proposals and building performance. This section reviews
some taxonomies (matrices of criteria, goals, procedures and standards) that should
be integrated into the future GEOSS-Digital Earth world-management system. These
develop Fuller’s concepts for what he initially named the 4D Air-Ocean World Town
Plan then termed the World Game and Spaceship Earth. In one of his last books,
Fuller said:
This design revolution must employ a world-around, satellite-interlinked, data-banks-and-
computer-accomplished conversion of present-day, exclusively geocentric, Spaceship Earth
wealth accounting [… to a system where …] computers fed with all the relevant energy-
efﬁciency facts will be able to demonstrate which uses will produce the greatest long-term
beneﬁt for all humanity (Fuller 1980, 199, 225).
Two critical factors lie at opposite ends of today’s project to deliver Fuller’s vision.
One is the need to decide what data to collect to understand the world’s conditions
and how to organize it effectively (the main concern of UN-GGIM and other UN
technical agencies, the Group on Earth Observations (building the GEOSS Common
Infrastructure, GCI), CODATA, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
(now disbanded) Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association (GSDI; Crompvoets
et al. 2008). The other challenge is for leaders of international land development
organizations to clarify how to identify and deliver all data relevant to future modeling
of eco-ethical developments. This agenda is being led by the World Bank (Global
Platform for Sustainable Cities), the C40 Large Cities for Climate Change group, the
Council on Tall Buildings and the Urban Habitat (CTBUH), the World Federation
of Engineering Organizations (WFEO), the World Green Building Council (WGBC)
and the OGC-buildingSMART alliance.
Guiding the collection and organization of satellite data are the essential climate
variables (ECVs) for all three domains of our planet’s environment: atmospheric,
hydrographic and terrestrial. The ECV datasets are intended to underpin future eco-
ethicalpracticesinlanddevelopment,andincluderiverdischarges,wateruse,ground-
water and lake levels, snow cover, glaciers and ice caps, permafrost and seasonally
frozen ground, albedo (surface reﬂectance), land cover (vegetation types), photosyn-
thetically active radiation, leaf area, biomass, ﬁre disturbance and soil moisture.
16
Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
553
Geodata, urban planning and natural resource administration agencies will need
to collaborate to obtain the ECV data relevant to their domains of governance and
to integrate it with the cadastral and other topographical datasets that they adminis-
ter. Also valuable are the lidar and radar scanning and 3D city modeling data that
are obtained by commercial EO satellite operators (including DigitalGlobe, Airbus
and Urthecast), aerial survey companies (such as AAM, Nearmap and Borbas), and
locality-diverse providers of terrestrial environmental imaging and remote sensing
services.
16.5.1
CityGML and 3D Cadastre
CityGML is an XML-based, 3D vector, open data model for storing and exchanging
3D city and landscape models that is based on the geography markup language
(GML) produced by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International
Standards Organization (ISO TC211). It deﬁnes the objects, properties, aggregations
and relations contained in models, allowing for them to be readily compared and for
correctly classiﬁed data to be reused. The platform allows for sophisticated analysis
tasks and thematic inquiries relevant to most urban professions and management
functions. CityGML is evolving continuously to improve 3D and 4D city modeling.
Dynamic variations of the properties of a city object can be represented using the
Dynamizer feature type. This enables speciﬁc objects in the 3D model to be linked
with simulations or time series data. This can be used to trigger dynamic behaviors
such as transformation of the geometry, thematic data, or the appearance of a speciﬁc
object. This event-driven dynamic sentience of a city model is a foundation for
advancing digital twinning of the physical world.
Current urban development approaches require more sophisticated conceptualiza-
tions of spatial data and new tools to holistically facilitate four key spatial planning
tasks: urban management, impact assessment, site and road selection, and strate-
gic planning. Sabri et al. (2015) developed a new framework to leverage current
3D geospatial and data model technologies in urban modeling and analysis. This
framework, including recent insights by Biljecki et al. (2014), adopts a new concep-
tualization for CityGML that covers most 3D city modeling requirements. Sabri’s
team demonstrated how complex 3D urban scenarios enable city designers to have
a greater understanding of existing and proposed urban forms and potential urban
heat islands. The study showed how 3D analysis plays a critical role in examining
the impacts of urban consolidation strategies and the densiﬁcation of inner cities.
Nevertheless, the 3D level of detail should be enhanced to support more accurate
decision making.
In a recent study, Agius et al. (2018) explained how rule-based 3D city modeling
enables planners to measure the physical impacts of building controls (e.g., heights,
554
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
shadows, setbacks) and the functional impacts (e.g., mixes of land uses). This might
be useful for land administration (including subdivisions) but, if strata title properties
are to be visualized or the public and private ownership of future developments needs
to be analyzed by stakeholders, today’s tools must be improved.
The ability to measure the capacities and implications of underground infras-
tructure (Qiao et al. 2019) and the above-ground services needed for huge future
developments can be added through combinations of 3D cadastre data and BIM
methods. Adopting a 3D cadastre (Aien et al. 2013) will enable users to more accu-
rately evaluate future changes in land and property values, which is a major concern
for many stakeholders involved in inner city redevelopment (Shin 2009).
16.5.2
Graph Databases: Lossless Processes for Data Cities
Graph databases have nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data. They
aidinanalysisofmany-manyrelationshipsandhaveapplicationsinmachinelearning,
fraud detection, social media, semantic harmonization and master data management.
Graphs are a key enabler of next-generation spatial platforms for the integrated digital
built environment (IDBE).
Recent Singapore research demonstrates potential for multidirectional lossless
transformation of semantic and geometric data across the paradigms from design
models to open standard formats. With traditional methods, there may be signiﬁ-
cant loss of data integrity and content at each step in the transformation from the
proprietary design ﬁles (native BIM) into various OpenBIM standards (IFCs), and
then into CityGML and a city model. This journey wrangles data between multiple
paradigms. By adopting a triple graph-based framework for semantic and geomet-
ric conversions a “complete and near-lossless” mapping between the models can be
achieved (Stouffs 2018). This framework can be applied to bulk and incremental
updates between these models and may be applicable to lossless transformations
between IFC versions (for example, IFC2x3 to IFC4x2) and pivoting from project
information models (PIMs) to asset information models (AIMs) at handover.
Also signiﬁcant for cities and major infrastructure projects and operations are
graph application platforms for master data management (MDM). Property type
graphs (with metadata at nodes and edges) will also become increasingly important
for building asset registers and to enable sophisticated twinning of a sentient virtual
model with its physical counterpart in the real world.
16.5.3
Open Public Life Data Protocol
Denmark’s Gehl Institute, founded by Jan Gehl and now led by Shin-pei Tsay, has
collaborated with city government agencies in Copenhagen, San Francisco and Seat-
tle to produce a data protocol for assembling and comparing metrics about how
16
Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
555
people use and enjoy public environments. Launched as a beta version in late 2017,
it includes a choice of eight components relevant to any public life survey: gender,
age, mode of mobility, groups, posture, activities, objects (accompanying people) and
“geotag” (which parts of a location are preferred). The protocol document explained
how to structure the survey to record all the information in data tables, to be saved as
CSV ﬁles that could be compared with the results of any similarly assembled survey.
Although this project was focused on using digital tools to collect and process the
survey information, it appears to be strongly inﬂuenced by Christopher Alexander’s
pattern language classiﬁcations (published before personal computers) to help design
comfortable indoor and outdoor places at different scales and for different times and
purposes (Gehl 2017; Alexander et al. 1977).
16.5.4
City Standards: ISO 37120
In 2014, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) launched its ﬁrst
suite of indicators to measure and compare the performance of cities across seven-
teen general themes including the economy, energy, governance, health, telecommu-
nications and innovation, transport, waste and water. Developed by the Global City
Indicators Facility (GCIF) at the University of Toronto and promoted by the related
World Council on City Data (WCCD), the ISO 37120 standard for sustainable cities
and communities was updated in 2018. Two subset standards documents, ISO 37122:
Indicators for Smart Cities and ISO 37123: Indicators for Resilient Cities, were also
produced (ISO 2018).
16.5.5
Data Cubes
Launched in 2013 by the national EO team at Geoscience Australia, the Australian
GeoscienceSpace-TimeDataCubeisasystemthatstacksmatchingLandsatscenesin
time sequences (currently up to ﬁfteen years) to allow for faster analysis of changing
conditions. The dataset for the whole of Australia amounts to almost four million
scenes and 110 TB of compressed geoTIFF ﬁles, which are analyzed by the Raijin
high-performancecomputinglabinCanberra.Technicianscanaccessthedatasetwith
a Python API that can generate speciﬁc mosaics and stacks of image ﬁles, which can
be interpreted via users’ own algorithms (Jackson 2013). The Data Cube system is
the foundation of the Digital Earth Australia national satellite mapping project. It is
supplied freely to research agencies in other countries under the name Open Data
Cube (ODC), under the auspices of the Committee for Earth Observation Satellites
(CEOS n.d.). One ODC was repurposed as the Africa Regional Data Cube, providing
satellite surveys to an initial group of ﬁve African nations; it was later expanded to
all 54 African countries as the Digital Earth Africa project (Digital Earth Africa n.d.)
556
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
In 2018, Peter Baumann at Jacobs University in Bremen received German research
funding to lead a BigDataCube project to improve Rasdaman (raster data manager)
software for data cubing satellite imagery from the European Space Agency’s Sen-
tinel constellation (source of the six terabytes per day of new satellite image ﬁles
that are stored in Germany’s CODE-DE archive). In addition to the commercial and
free/light versions of Rasdaman, Baumann is developing data cube standards for the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), which works with the International Standards
Organization (ISO; Anon 2018).
16.5.6
Compact Cities
In 2012, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
released a list of fourteen characteristics of compact cities, which could be used as
indicators to compare and improve operations. Compact and often high-rise cities
such as Manhattan, Hong Kong and Paris are more efﬁcient than sprawling low-rise
cities with wide trafﬁc thoroughfares, such as Los Angeles and Dubai. The criteria
are high residential and employment densities, mixtures of land uses, a ﬁne grain
of land uses (small sizes of land parcels), strong social and economic interaction,
contiguous development (rather than vacant land or street-level carparks), contained
urban development within demarcated limits, good urban infrastructure (especially
sewage and water mains), multimodal transport, high connectivity of streets (includ-
ing footpaths and bicycle lanes), extensive coverage of impervious surfaces and a
low ratio of open space (OECD 2012).
16.5.7
EcoDesign
Malaysian architect Ken Yeang pioneered ecological strategies for commercial tow-
ers and urban precincts. He clariﬁed an “endemic” (climate and place-responsive)
design system that is now standard practice in urban development. He rejected key
modernist routines for tall buildings to look the same on all four sides, be built around
a central lift core, have sealed windows and be mechanically air conditioned through-
out. Instead, he designed buildings to respond to their different compass aspects and
sun and wind conditions; positioned lift cores on the sides of buildings where they
could best block excessive sun and wind and would allow for courtyards or atria to
be landscaped in the center; introduced natural sunlight and ventilation via openable
windows to the foyer, lift lobbies, ﬁre stairs and toilets; and designed sky gardens
and sunny courtyards on upper levels. By working closely with engineers on climate-
response tests of his building models, he discovered that sky gardens could break
the ﬂows of winds down the surfaces of his towers to reduce gusts for pedestrians
walking on nearby streets and plazas. On upper ﬂoor levels, some winds could be
deﬂected into the buildings to ventilate spaces and cool the structures.
16
Digital City: An Urban Perspective on Digital Earth
557
Yeang ﬁrst applied green architecture principles to his tall buildings in tropi-
cal cities—beginning with Menara Mesiniaga, an ofﬁce building in Kuala Lumpur
(1992). His most substantial book, EcoDesign (Yeang 2006), was the ﬁrst to clarify
an eco-scientiﬁc system to design site-sensitive architectural projects anywhere in
the world. His method requires understanding the natural context of each site by
identifying its biome (regional community of diverse species sharing the same cli-
mate and terrestrial conditions). His system also included an “interactions matrix”
that requires four sets of data to be gathered to assess four main ecological impacts
of a building scheme: its relations to its environment, its internal relations, its inputs
(of energy and matter) and its outputs. He urged architects to plan developments to
avoid destroying healthy ecosystems or to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems. He also
described three criteria for modeling any design: a description of the built system, a
description of its environment and a mapping of interactions between the building
and its environment (Yeang 2006, 59–73).
16.5.8
Positive Development
Counterproductive practices in the “sustainable urban development” movement have
been targeted by Janis Birkeland, author of an evidence-based ecological building
theory that she named “positive development” and “net-positive design” (Birkeland
2008). She proposed that every building should be expected to sequester the amount
of carbon used in its operations and the amount of carbon emitted through resource
extraction and consumption. Every building project destroys many tons of the Earth’s
natural resources and the link between mining and construction is the major global
cause of excessive carbon emissions. The nature and extent of this problem are
obscured by green building assessment practices that “measure the wrong things in
the wrong ways”—and that measure negative impacts only up to zero without mea-
suring positive impacts. Birkeland suggested that buildings that support substantial
and permanent planting (green walls and roofs) will amortize carbon far earlier in
their life cycles than if they are only operated with renewable energy sources. She
expected machine-analyzed data to allow for much more comprehensive and accu-
rate analyses of buildings before and after construction, but the issues being recorded
and assessed must be changed and expanded.
16.5.9
Cities and the Digital Earth Nervous System
In a 2010 article for the International Journal of Digital Earth, European scientists
explained Digital Earth as a “metaphor for the organisation and access to digital
information through a multiscale, three-dimensional representation of the globe”
(De Longueville et al. 2010). They extended that vision by forecasting a “self-aware
nervous system” to provide decision makers with improved alerting mechanisms for
558
D. Jackson and R. Simpson
crisis prediction and situational awareness. This goal may prove the most beneﬁcial
for governments and citizens in urban areas—and strategies are essential to clarify
how the relevant ofﬁcials and stakeholders can contribute to and usefully exploit such
a sophisticated system of automated operations.
New international protocols are essential to give urban authorities rapid access
and accurate, automatic analyses of the data sets relevant to their challenges. Several
international corporations—including Mapbox, Orbital Insight and OmniSci—are
managing and analyzing very large quantities of geodata for government customers
which cannot afford or do not ﬁnd it feasible to apply the necessary resources and
infrastructure to maintain such sophisticated operations.
One geospatially advanced city (and nation) is Singapore, which ranked fourth
in the 2018 countries geospatial readiness index—not far behind the United States,
United Kingdom and Germany, and ahead of China (Geospatial Media and Commu-
nications 2018). Its extraordinarily integrated government created a national spatial
data infrastructure (NSDI) system in 2009, is locally training urban geotech special-
ists through joint research programs with Switzerland’s ETH Future Cities Lab and
America’s MIT SENSEable Cities Lab (with centers located at the National Univer-
sity of Singapore), has accelerated a Smart Nation policy since 2014, launched the
Virtual Singapore project in 2016 and released the Singapore Geospatial Masterplan
in 2018. Singapore aims to foster “geosmart government”, “geoempowered people”,
and “a thriving geoindustry”.
16.6
Summary
International scientists supporting the Digital Earth and GEOSS visions are apply-
ing satellite and semiconductor-enabled technology to accelerate delivery of Fuller’s
visions for a “4D Air-Ocean World Town Plan” and efﬁcient management of
resources on “Spaceship Earth”. Many governments have been promoting “smart
city” policies and programs since the 1990s, when wireless and mobile telecom-
munications began to be commercialized internationally. The authors of this paper
suggest it is now important to not only emphasize systems that enable humans to
communicate worldwide but also next-generation infrastructure for societies to be
accurately informed about our planet’s environmental conditions and challenges.
At the urban scale of today’s planet-simulation project, there is a need to integrate
area-speciﬁc modeling of natural environmental systems with current best practices
in building information modeling and city information modeling. All three meth-
ods must be improved to incorporate real-time streaming of Earth observations data
obtained via sensing and scanning the light and radio waves of the electromagnetic
spectrum. This satellite and semiconductor-enabled movement has been labeled “the
new science of cities”, “geodesign”, “senseable cities”, “digital cities”, and “data
cities”. As De Longueville et al. clariﬁed in 2010, it seems crucial for the Digital Earth
“nervous system” to become self-aware and be able to obtain and respond more auto-
matically to unprecedented quantities of environmental information—far too much

to be processed by humans. This chapter highlighted some urban advances, strate-
gies, issues and case studies that are signiﬁcant contributions to this millennium’s
Digital Earth/GEOSS imperative.

Abstract Natural and cultural heritage, the common wealth of human beings, are
keys to human understanding of the evolution of our planet and social development.
The protection and conservation of natural and cultural heritage is the common
responsibility of all mankind. Spatial information technology provides a new applied
theory and tool for the protection and utilization of natural and cultural heritage.
This chapter is divided into four parts. The ﬁrst part elaborates the connotation of
digital heritage, the differences and connections between digital heritage and physical
heritage, the technology of digital heritage formation and the research objectives and
content of digital heritage. Parts 2 and 3 discuss the contents and methods of digital
natural heritage and cultural heritage, respectively, and some practical case studies. In
the fourth part, the future development trends of digital heritage research in protection
and utilization are described, as well as six research directions that deserve attention.

A Brief Introduction to Digital Heritage
Natural and cultural heritage, with unique value in the realms of science, culture, his-
tory and art, are like jewels emerging from a wide variety of ground object types that
shine on the surface of the Earth. Heritage is deﬁned as our legacy from the past, what

we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. As common wealth
of all mankind, its enduring value should be kept for future generations. Accord-
ingly, the recognition and preservation of its outstanding universal value (OUV) has
been a great concern for UNESCO, highlighting the emerging role of digital heritage,
which is deﬁned by UNESCO as the use of digital media in the service of preserving,
protecting, studying and presenting these heritages.
The great value and signiﬁcance of digital heritage was afﬁrmed by two UNESCO
documents released in 2003: the Guidelines for the Preservation of Digital Heritage
(National Library of Australia 2003) and the Charter on the Preservation of the Digi-
tal Heritage (UNESCO 2009). The Charter describes digital heritage as “resources of
human knowledge or expression, whether cultural, educational, scientiﬁc and admin-
istrative, or embracing technical, legal, medical and other kinds of information, are
increasingly created digitally, or converted into digital form from existing analogue
resources.” When resources are “born digital”, there is no other format but the digital
original, including text, databases, still and animated images, audio tapes, photos,
software, and web pages.
Many of these digital heritage materials will be passed down from generation to
generation. Digital heritage may be classiﬁed by genres: information resources stored
in speciﬁc carriers (such as optical disks, disks, and tapes), computer databases, or
disseminated via the internet or digital media, and preprint materials or archives held
in e-prints.
“Digital heritage”, a concept that is distinguished from its physical counterpart,
constitutes an integral part of the Digital Earth program. Digitalizing heritage enables
theenduringvalueofphysicalheritagetobelong-termpreserved,easilyaccessibleto,
widely shared and disseminated to the public. Heritage in the digital form also facil-
itates in-depth research from various perspectives (Hu et al. 2003). Digital heritage
plays an important role in permanently preserving the information derived from phys-
ical heritage. The implication of “digital heritage” used in this handbook is compati-
ble with that described in the two UNESCO documents mentioned above. However,
unless otherwise speciﬁed, the term of “digital heritage” here refers to “digital natu-
ral and cultural heritage”, which means digital resources or products converted from
existing natural and cultural heritage or analogue resources. It includes dynamic or
static digital information created during the process of digitalization, which includes
creation and documentation, preservation and protection, processing, dissemination
and presentation. In this handbook, digital heritage refers to the categories of cul-
tural relics and natural landscapes. Similar to general digital heritage, digital culture
and natural heritage exist as information resources that are stored in speciﬁc carriers
(such as optical disks, magnetic disks and tapes) or computer databases, or presented
on display and disseminated via the internet.
The technologies involved in digital heritage cover a variety of aspects including
creation, storage, monitoring, dissemination, presentation and protection.
17
Digital Heritage
567
The creation and documentation of digital heritage consist of technological pro-
cesses such as digital perception, data collection and processing, information extrac-
tion and interpretation, and digitally documenting.
Joint efforts should be undertaken to preserve and protect digital heritage and
to keep it accessible to the public and maintain its long-term availability to future
generations. Efforts include developing technology and tools, designing manage-
ment frameworks, initiating protection programs, taking management measures, and
related law-making issues.
The dissemination and presentation of digital heritage involves several aspects
including the technology and tools for digital creation, channels and measures for
dissemination, management measures, and the support from regulations and laws.
Digital heritage should be presented vividly to ensure that the public can understand,
share and make good use of it.
Digitalheritagefocusesonthedigitalproductsderivedfromitsculturalandnatural
heritage ontologies and related environment. The research covers the process of
how digital heritage is created and presented, how to protect it and develop related
products, and how to transform these products into new digital products in the form
of knowledge. It is also necessary to have a profound understanding of the ontology-
environment interaction, and therefore take effective protective measures in advance.
Digital heritage research features noncontact and nondestructive ontologies.
Digital heritage shares some common characteristics of cultural heritage. The
research is centered on the techniques and knowledge for (1) digitalization of the
heritage ontology; (2) preservation of digital heritage; (3) the use of digital her-
itage (4) demonstration, sharing, and publicity of digital heritage; and (5) laws and
regulations on digital heritage protection.
The creation of digital heritage, namely, the digitization of heritage ontologies,
involves the use of satellite-based or airborne data as well as data obtained from
ground and underground exploration or manual observation. It involves a set of
techniques and methods for nondestructive detection, monitoring, and evaluation. In
addition, heritage preservation and digitalization also need the support of legislation
at the national level, which constitutes the cornerstone for implementing digital
heritage programs. The use of digital heritage involves a wide range of technologies
and knowledge in terms of digital generation, heritage protection, monitoring, and
law-making issues on heritage protection.
The purpose of digital heritage preservation is to ensure that it remains accessible
to the public and to prevent it from disappearing. Accordingly, digital representation
of heritage ensures that the essential value of its ontology is widespread and endur-
ing. To achieve this, speciﬁed approaches are suggested for the use, research and
protection of two kinds of heritage, corresponding to its natural or cultural charac-
teristics.

17.2.1
Technology and Research Methods of Digital Natural
Heritage
The Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage
describes “natural heritage” as “natural features consisting of material and biological
structures or groups of such structures of outstanding universal value from an aes-
thetic or scientiﬁc point of view; geological and natural geographical structures of
outstanding universal value from a scientiﬁc or protective point of view, and clearly
designated as threatened animal and plant habitats; natural attractions or clearly
deﬁned natural areas with outstanding universal value from a scientiﬁc, conserva-
tion or natural beauty point of view.” Comprehensive use of digital technologies
and methods for outstanding universal value (OUV) characterization of elements of
natural heritage include the observation and its originality, integrity (AI) monitoring
and evaluation as effective measures to achieve heritage protection and management.
To ensure the feasibility, effectiveness and long-term nature of digital technol-
ogy for natural heritage monitoring, practical and simple monitoring and evaluation
methods should be adopted, and the collection and management of monitoring data
should be standardized. With the rapid development of 3S technology, multisource
high-resolution (temporal, spatial, spectral) images form a large amount of remote
sensing data. We have carried out different remote sensing spatial scale data fusion
techniques. The spatial analysis function of GIS, high-precision satellite navigation
and positioning functions, and different evaluation models of natural heritage site
protection are used for Sustainable Heritage Protection and development monitor-
ing, taking into account the monitoring objectives and conditions of different types
of natural heritage sites. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, ﬁeld
investigation and remote sensing investigation, the OUV and its original integrity
can be effectively monitored and assessed, and natural heritage can be effectively
protected and managed.

Case Study of Digital Natural Heritage
17.2.2.1
Information Extraction from Mountain Vertical Belt Based
on an NDVI-DEM Method Model
Xinjiang Tianshan Mountain is an outstanding representative of the mountain ecosys-
tem in temperate arid regions. It has a typical vertical natural belt spectrum in temper-
ate arid regions. Within a horizontal distance of less than 30 km, Bogda’s elevation
rises from 1,380 to 5,445 m, and the vertical elevation difference is nearly 4,100 m.
Six vertical natural belts from desert steppe to ice and snow belts have developed:
temperate desert steppe belt, mountain steppe belt, alpine coniferous forest belt,
17
Digital Heritage
569
alpine meadow belt, Alpine cushion vegetation belt and ice and Snow Belt. At the
Bogda World Heritage Site, snow-capped mountains, glaciers, rivers, lakes, forests
and meadows coexist with each other to present the superlative natural beauty of
mountains in a desert area. The vertical natural belt distribution reﬂects the water
and heat variations at different elevations, gradients and slopes. It is an outstanding
example for the study of biological community succession in mountain ecosystems
in an arid belt undergoing global climate change.
The impacts of climate change are the main driving factor of vertical belt change.
According to the seasonal and periodic characteristics of the monitoring objects
for the protection of the Bogda Heritage Site, Wang Xinyuan’s research group (Ji
et al. 2018) selected TM data from June 19, 1989, and OLI data from July 28,
2016 (Fig. 17.1), combined with auxiliary data such as ground object spectrometer
information, ﬁeld GPS acquisition and UAV data, and made use of scatter plot of
DEM-NDVI-Land Cover Classiﬁcation (Fig. 17.2) based on probability and statis-
tics. Based on the study, the demarcation elevation of the vertical natural belts was

the past 30 years.
Remote sensing images are classiﬁed according to the zoning content of vertical
zones.Theimagesareclassiﬁedbycomprehensivesupervisedclassiﬁcation,decision
tree hierarchical classiﬁcation and visual interpretation.
Using the superpositioned DEM data, NDVI (Chang et al. 2015) and classiﬁcation
results of the Bogda Heritage Site, the “DEM-NDVI-classiﬁcation information scat-
ter plots” for 1989 and 2016 were created, as shown in Fig. 17.3. The two-year trend
in the distribution of scatters shows an inverted U-shape of “uniform rise-remain
stable-uniform decline”.
With the elevation increase in the Bogda area, the heat and water and the environ-
ment of vegetation growth change, and the coverage types change regularly, corre-
sponding to the six colors in the scatter plot. There was a clear demarcation between
scatters in different vertical belts. The proportions of pixel classiﬁcation attributes
at different elevation ranges in the scatter map of the DEM-NDVI-Land Cover Clas-
siﬁcation was calculated by sliding statistics, and the vertical zoning results for the
Bogda Heritage Site in 1989 and 2016 were obtained by setting thresholds. The
extraction results are shown in Table 17.1.

The vertical belts of the Bogda Natural Heritage Site in the Tianshan Mountains
in 1989 and 2016 were extracted, as shown in Table 17.1. The boundary between the
temperate desert steppe belt and mountain steppe belt decreased 93 m, the boundary
between the alpine meadow belt and alpine cushion vegetation belt moved up 11 m,
and the lower limit of the ice and Snow Belt increased 54 m. This shows that the area
of mountain grassland has greatly expanded, and the protection of natural heritage
is critical; due to the impacts of global climate change, the glaciers have retreated.
Therefore, considering the problem of OUV performance in heritage sites, it is nec-
essary to carry out Sustainable Heritage monitoring using qualitative and quantitative
methods, ﬁeld investigation, social investigation and remote sensing investigation to
protect and manage natural heritage.
Using ﬁeld research and Google Earth high-resolution image data, six points were
selected in each area where the land type obviously changed. Thirty-six veriﬁcation
points were selected to verify the mountain vertical band extraction results. As shown
in Table 17.2, the elevation of the veriﬁcation points ﬂuctuated above and below the
demarcation elevations, but the overall trend was consistent with the research results.
17.2.2.2
Recognition of Coral Reef Health Status Based on RS and GIS
Corals require harsh growth conditions, and subtle changes in sea temperature, salin-
ity, sediment content and other environmental factors can lead to widespread bleach-
ing or death of corals. Coral reefs are the most responsive ecosystem to climate
change on a global scale. Therefore, it is very important to grasp the health status of
coral reefs in time to study the effects of climate change and the utilization and pro-
tection of marine ecological resources (Holden and Ledrew 1998). Australia’s Great
Barrier Reef (GBR) is 2011 km long and 161 km at its widest point. The scenery is
charming and the ﬂow of water is complex. It is a sensitive area of global change,
with more than 400 different types of coral reefs. The GBR, extending 2000 km
along Queensland’s coast, is a globally outstanding example of an ecosystem that
has evolved over millennia. The area has been exposed and ﬂooded by at least four
glacial and interglacial cycles, and reefs have grown on the continental shelf over
the past 15,000 years.
Kutser et al. (2003) used hyperspectral sensors to measure the reﬂectivity spectra
of six different colors of coral communities in the Great Barrier Reef (approximately
5–6 m deep), and analyzed live corals, dead corals, and algae. The reﬂectivity of
ground objects obviously differs between 550 and 680 nm; the spectral reﬂectivity
of sand is the highest, the reﬂectivity curve is gentle, and the reﬂectivity curve is
the easiest to distinguish from those of other materials. Coral and seaweed have low
reﬂectivity. The waveform is determined by the light absorption characteristics of
pigments in the body, which comprises wavelengths from 500 to 625 nm for the big
difference in reﬂectivity waveforms between coral and seaweed.

In addition, Clark et al. (2000) found that recently dead corals can be distinguished
from corals whose death time is longer than 6 months by derivative spectrum. In
addition to spectral measurement and analysis of coral reefs, Landsat and SPOT
series satellite data can be used to identify coral reefs with coarse accuracy (Benﬁeld
et al. 2007). Collin and Hench (2012) identiﬁed the healthy and unhealthy status
of coral reefs from Worldview-2 high-resolution imagery using a support vector
machine (SVM).

Habitat Suitability Assessment of Animal Habitat Based
on Spatial Information Technology
A great deal of observed evidence shows that the combination of climate change
and other pressure sources has led to the migration of species distribution, wildlife
phenology, reproductive behavior, population composition and ecosystem function
changes.
The giant panda is a rare wild animal unique to China. It is also the ﬂagship
species of biodiversity conservation in the world. The giant pandas are now conﬁned
to six mountain systems, from north to south: Qinling Mountain, Minshan Mountain,
Qionglai Mountain, Big Facies Mountain, Small Facies Mountain and Liangshan
Mountain. Based on spatial information technology, the Wang Xinyuan Research
Group (Song et al. 2014; Zhen et al. 2018) carried out a habitat suitability assessment
of giant panda habitat.
Based on remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) and other spatial
techniques, using the latest data from the fourth Giant Panda Survey and the max-
imum entropy model (MaxEnt), the assessment of the impacts of climate change
on the habitat of giant panda (Ya’an) was carried out at this stage and is planned in
2050. In the course of carrying out the detailed assessment, the latest data on panda
occurrences and human disturbance factors were based on the fourth Giant Panda
Survey (2011–2014), with elevation, slope and aspect as physical environmental
variables. The distribution map of the staple food bamboo and distance from water
source were biological factors. Human disturbance factors included the interference
factors, with a high encounter rate in ﬁve study areas of roads, mines, hydropower
stations transmission lines and scenic spots. The bioclimatic data were derived from
climate variables on the WorldClim website, 12 land cover thematic data from 2001
to 2015 that were uniformly processed by NDVI, and high-resolution remote sensing
data such as GF-1, as shown in Fig. 17.4.
The research analyzed the suitable conditions of giant panda habitat and its chang-
ing trends and related rules under the background of the current stage of and future
climate change in Ya’an, Sichuan Province in China. Through on-site visits to nature
reserve management agencies and local residents’ research, the evaluation results
were veriﬁed through ﬁeld studies. The evaluation results, such as those shown in
Fig. 17.5, provide a deep understanding of the trends and extent of habitat change in

Digital Cultural Heritage
Digital cultural heritage is the application of the theory, methodology and technology
related to Digital Earth in the ﬁeld of cultural heritage. Applying digital technology
focused on spatial information technology to tangible cultural heritage is of great
signiﬁcance for the protection, inheritance and exploitation of cultural heritage.

Digital Cultural Heritage Research and Technical
Methods
As the core technology supporting the deep development and wide application of
Digital Earth, spatial technology provides new means as well as new tasks and con-
notations for digital cultural heritage research. Through digital technologies such as
photogrammetry and remote sensing, digital cultural heritage can realize nondestruc-
tive archaeological detection, digital archiving, dynamic monitoring and evaluation
of heritage, and support the preservation and sustainability of the heritage ontol-
ogy and the environment on which it relies. The main technical methods for digital
cultural heritage research include:
17.3.1.1
Space Archaeological Technology
Space archaeological technology integrates worldwide earth observation technology
from space, air to ground and underground exploration technology to detect and
discover archaeological objects (Luo et al. 2019). In the positioning and discov-
ery of heritage, technical features of spatial earth observation technology including
the high-resolution, multi-spectral and multi-resolution nature, objectivity and non-
intrusiveness can be fully utilized to provide technical support for archaeological
576
X. Wang et al.
heritage investigation, exploration and research. The remains of ancient human activ-
ities (surface or subsurface) can lead to variances in the spatial structure between
the remains and their surroundings. These are represented in the digital records of
remotely sensed imagery as interpretation marks such as micro geomorphology,
soil moisture, and vegetation growth distribution, which have become the theoretical
basis of remote sensing archaeology. Space archaeology is the inheritance and devel-
opment of remote sensing archaeology. It extends the working spectrum of remote
sensing archaeology and has the advantages of multi-scale observation of a satellite
with aerial and ground integration. The introduction of geophysical exploration and
other technologies has enabled the development of spatial archaeological observa-
tions of the subsurface or even lower, providing a new approach for nondestructive
detection of buried remains.
17.3.1.2
Digital Recording and Preservation of Cultural Heritage
Accurate digital recording is the premise of heritage protection and monitoring.
Based on principles of photogrammetry and remote sensing, it collects and digitizes
ground control points by acquiring satellite and aerial high-resolution remote sensing
images, and uses photogrammetry software to produce high-precision maps of the
heritage ontology. Through the three-dimensional (3D) data acquisition equipment
of aerial, low-altitude aerial, car-based or ground platforms, 3D modeling software
is used to construct 3D models and record the shapes and spatial attributes of the
heritage ontology and the environment. A large heritage database system that can be
queried and updated is then formed using geographic information system (GIS) and
database technology to digitally manage various types of heritage information.
17.3.1.3
Heritage Ontological and Environmental Dynamic Monitoring
By obtaining data on the same heritage object at different times, through comparative
analysis, changing information identiﬁcation and model calculation, the status and
potential risks of the heritage object can be evaluated. Earth observation technology
based on Digital Earth has great potential for monitoring large cultural heritage
remotely and dynamically and even in 3D form. The analysis and evaluation of
the situation and risk of the heritage object are conducted by applying artiﬁcial or
intelligent remote sensing recognition technology and monitoring and identiﬁcation
algorithms on remote sensing data at a certain interval (appropriate spatial resolution,
spectral resolution and temporal resolution, etc.) or 3D digital models.
17.3.1.4
Heritage Demonstration on Virtual Reality Technology
Virtual reality (VR) is a new and integral technology in the sphere of computer
science, which developed from the integration of disciplines involving computer
17

graphics technology, multimedia technology, sensor technology, human-computer

lation technology. With advantage of lifelike, immersive reconstructions, it can be

17.3.2
Digital Cultural Heritage Application Cases
17.3.2.1
Space Archaeology
As a successor of remote sensing archaeology, Space archaeology is a new paradigm
of space information technology employed in archaeology (Wang and Guo 2015).
Through multiple technology integration and comprehensive analysis, it provides
the essential information linked to the acquisition, interpretation and reconstruction
of archaeological remains. Space archaeology research is in the emerging stages. At
present, the work is mainly concentrated in deserts, Mayan jungles and the Nile Delta
using remote sensing-based methods of archaeological faint information extraction,
and has achieved a series of important scientiﬁc achievements and archaeological
discoveries. American archaeologists discovered the notable ancient Egyptian city of
Alexandria, which had slept in the sea for thousands of years; Greek archaeologists
employed infrared photographs to discover the ancient city of Hekike, which was
destroyed by an earthquake in 373 B.C. in Corinth. Guo (1997) used space shuttle
imaging radar data to discover the great walls of the Sui and Ming Dynasties buried
in the dry sand at the junction of Shanxi and Ningxia. Ninfo et al. (2009) visually
interpreted and digitally reconstructed the urban structure and paleoenvironmental
background of the ancient port of Altinum using high-resolution visible and near-
infrared aerial photographs and digital elevation models. Evans et al. (2007) used
GIS tools to map the most detailed archaeological information of the Angkor Wat
site based on multisource remote sensing data such as optical and SAR information.
Parcak et al. (2016) conducted a spatial archaeological study of the Nile Delta.
They investigated thousands of ancient sites in the area and identiﬁed ancient city
street ruins and unﬁnished pyramids based on high-resolution remote sensing data
to reconstruct the ancient Egyptian empire.
The Silk Road is precious cultural heritage owned and shared by all mankind. To
enhance the ability to rescue archaeological discoveries, space archaeology provides
new technical methods for the detection, discovery and reconstruction of sites along
the Silk Road at different scales. With the beneﬁt of spatial information technol-
ogy, a spatial forecast model of heritages based on GIS spatial analysis was built
by Wang and Guo (2015) by considering the similarity of environmental and geo-
morphological landscapes of the ancient Silk Road between NW China (Luo et al.
2014a, b) and southern Tunisia using satellite imagery, historical documents, archae-
ological survey data and other multivariate data. Three ancient city sites related to
578
X. Wang et al.
old stages in Dunhuang, northwest China, were discovered on the high-resolution
satellite remote sensing imagery. The ﬁeld archaeological survey supported by GPS
technologies and historical research material conﬁrmed the speciﬁc locations of the
ancient stages. Based on the Digital Earth platform and existing spatial archaeolog-
ical results, the postal system between Guazhou and Shazhou (two prefectures) in
the period of the post-Wuhou Tianshou second year (A.D. 691) was digitally recon-
structed (Fig. 17.6). It laid a scientiﬁc database foundation to study the route of the
ancient Silk Road and the changes in the ancient oasis in medieval China. The new
Fig. 17.6 Space archaeology of the silk road in China (upper) and Southern Tunisia (lower)
17
Digital Heritage
579
paradigm of spatial archaeology has been promoted and applied to Tunisia, where 10
ancient Roman remains have been discovered; the legacy evidence chain reﬂected the
military defense system of the southern frontiers of the Roman Empire (Fig. 17.6).
The comparative space archaeological study of the defense system along the Silk
Road between the Han Great Wall and the Roman Lima system provides detailed
knowledge of the defense system, border defense strategy, human-land relationship
and environmental changes in areas along the Silk Road as scientiﬁc references.
17.3.2.2
Cultural Heritage Monitoring and Protection
In the face of frequent natural disasters, global changes and increased human activ-
ities (such as urbanization, tourism development and local wars), the sustainable
protection of cultural heritage has encountered challenges. As a common nonrenew-
able wealth of all mankind, safeguarding and protecting the world’s heritage is the
focus of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goal ‘Sustainable Cities and Com-
munities’. Considering the wide coverage, diverse types and different landscapes
of cultural heritage, it is urgent to take advantage of near real-time, wide coverage
and high precision of remote sensing big data under the digital earth framework for
dynamic monitoring and intelligent protection of cultural heritage.
First, due to the rapid development of sensor technology and the Internet of
Things in recent years, heritage protectors can now automatically monitor elements
of micro environmental change information in near real-time, from the monument to
the landscape (e.g., humidity, temperature, air pollution, power, precipitation, struc-
ture vibration and deformation), providing quantitative data for the identiﬁcation of
trigger mechanisms for heritage sites affected by diseases and for the consequent
conservation measures.
Second, high-resolution remote sensing platforms with multiple bands and high
revisit frequency and satellite-airborne (low-altitude) information processing tech-
nology make it possible to monitor the whole-day and all-weather dynamics of a
heritage scene; the extraction and storage of topographic factors such as slope and
water catchment can aid in detailed mapping for heritage protection; natural disas-
ters such as landslides and human activities such as urbanization can be identiﬁed
by remote sensing images, and the GIS platform space-time analysis function can be
used to support early warning and assessment of heritage risks.
Third, the key advantage of Digital Earth platforms such as Google Earth, World-
Wind and ArcGIS Explorer is the wide use of Keyhole Markup Language (KML) to
ease the integration of multisource datasets from different providers and to simulta-
neously visualize and identify relationships for use in subsequent quantitative inves-
tigations. Cultural heritage applications require the integration of heterogeneous
georeferenced 1D/2D/3D/4D data from local computers or data obtained ‘on the
ﬂy’ from distributed sources due to the demands of comprehensive archaeological
understanding and knowledge discovery. In Google Earth, these data are usually in
KML format. A case study was conducted on part of the Great Wall (Fig. 17.7a) in
NW China (Luo et al. 2018) in the early 20th century by famous archaeologists and
580
X. Wang et al.

tree structure of the KML layers in GE; b the archaeological maps made by Stein; c the archaeo-
logical maps made by Hedin; d the operation ﬂowchart for our UAV investigation. We deleted the
photo layer in the supplementary ﬁle because the volume was too large
geographers, who made many great discoveries and uncovered its mysteries. The
work of these expeditions served different roles and provided clues to researchers
seeking to ﬁnd unknown sites. The most famous explorers were Stein and Hedin,
and their precious investigation reports and archaeological maps (Fig. 17.7b, c) play
important roles in understanding the changes that have occurred in the Middle East
and Central Asia in the past century, especially in terms of land use and land cover
(LULC).
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) investigation of the Great Wall was carried out
(Fig. 17.7d). All of the original and processed data (courses, photos, triangulation and
mesh), ﬁnal products (orthophotos, DEM and 3D model) and derivative information
(proﬁles and volumes) were saved in KML format. Members of the public and scien-
tiﬁc peers can download and reproduce the data for integration with archaeological
maps and their own data. For example, based on these high-resolution UAV-generated
DEM and 3D model analyses, a Great Wall Integrity Index was deﬁned and applied in
quantitative evaluation of Ming earthen Great Wall erosion status. Stein and Hedin’s
archaeological maps were also used in this case; these can be downloaded from
the Japanese National Institute of Informatics (http://dsr.nii.ac.jp). By browsing in
GoogleEarth, it was evident that Hedin’s archaeological map of our proposed pilot
17
Digital Heritage
581
area was more detailed than Stein’s (Fig. 17.7b). We were unable to ﬁnd any marks
showing the linear traces of the Great Wall in Stein’s map but they are present in
Hedin’s map (Fig. 17.7c). In future research based on data visualization and integra-
tion in GE and the LULC speciﬁc situations established by GE VHR imagery, it will
be possible to use UAV data and archaeological maps to deduce historical LULC
changes in the past century along the Great Wall.
However, compared with spatial archaeological detection (which can be traced
back to remote sensing archaeology), there is still a lack of research in the method-
ology and applied strategy of spatial technology employed for heritage monitoring
and protection. The existing work on the monitoring of the heritage ontology and
environment is often isolated and the monitoring elements and means are relatively
simple, which affects the comprehensive understanding and systematic response to
the sustainable protection of cultural heritage. Recently, Xiao et al. (2018), from the
perspective of UN Sustainable Development Goals 11 and 8, proposed that geospatial
information technology such as photogrammetry, remote sensing and spatial infor-
mation would play an important role in defending and protecting cultural heritage
and sustainable tourism. Chen et al. (2017) developed a two-scale radar interferom-
etry method and model for deformation monitoring and health diagnosis of heritage
sites affected by disease (Fig. 17.8) that considered the dynamic changes in heritage

582
X. Wang et al.
ecosystems, monitored environmental factors (including urbanization, forest degra-
dation, land use, groundwater level) to resolve the current controversy surround-
ing the potential structural collapse of monuments in Angkor. They constructed the
dynamic model of the disease evolution of the Angkor temple complex and unveiled
the mystery of the decline of the heritage site, bringing a new insight for the site
sustainable conservation.
17.3.2.3
Virtual Reconstruction of Cultural Heritage
The protection and sustainable development of cultural heritage can be understood
from a narrow point of view as the documentation, restoration and maintenance of
the heritage site. From a broad perspective, it should be extended to the cognition,
understanding and inheritance of the human civilization based on the protection of
the heritage entity. Due to the rapid development of information technology in the
internet and big data era, the visual demonstration of heritage information from mul-
tiple sources can be realized through virtual reconstruction scientiﬁcally, intuitively
and vividly, which greatly promotes the dissemination and inheritance of ancient
civilization.
The virtual reconstruction of digital heritage includes three main aspects. The ﬁrst
is to combine multisource data to model historical sites and the paleoenvironment and
establish virtual ancient scenes; the second is to design lively and representative key
historical and cultural events and scene elements (such as costumes or hairstyles that
reﬂect the cultural elements of the time, street arrangements, etc.) considering the
cultural background and geographical environment of speciﬁc historical periods; the
last is to realize the digital display of virtual ancient scenes integrating virtual reality,
holographic projection, augmented reality, digital animation and other technologies.
By providing visual, auditory, tactile and other sensory simulations, it allows for users
to immerse themselves in the cultural relic environment and its historical context
(Mortara et al. 2014).
Some relevant experts and scholars have achieved fruitful results in this ﬁeld,
such as the virtual reconstruction of the cultural site of Pompeii by the University
of Geneva and the digital restoration of Yuanmingyuanby Tsinghua University, but
there are still some major challenges in the virtual reconstruction process for cultural
heritage.
First, cultural heritage often contains various elements and complicated space
characteristics. It is difﬁcult for a single platform or sensor to meet the requirements
of all types of data acquisition due to multi-platform, multisource, heterogeneous
sensors. The need for collaborative stereoscopic observations is increasingly evi-
dent (Lin et al. 2014). The cultural heritage HuaixiuShanzhuang (HXSZ) in Suzhou,
China, has a complex structure, which is a challenge for modeling. To acquire high-
accuracy 3D models, Liang et al. (2018) collected point clouds via terrestrial laser
scanning(TLS) and modeled texture via terrestrial digital photogrammetry(TDP)
(Luo et al. 2014a, b). They fused the TLS and unmanned aerial vehicle digital pho-
togrammetry (UAVDP) point clouds and integrated the TDP point clouds with the
17
Digital Heritage
583
already-merged point clouds for 3D modeling and digital documentation. The multi-
ple surveying methods, multisource and multi-scale data collection, procession and
presentation and documentation overcome the limitations of a single technology and
data source, providing a solution for high-accuracy preservation of cultural heritage
sites that contain complex space characteristics.
Second, multi-sensor observations are prone to many structural problems such
as data structure differences, uneven acquisition granularity, and weak spatial and
temporal coupling. The development of collaborative observation, joint registration,
and multisource data fusion modeling techniques can provide digital protection for
cultural heritage. In addition, the integration of multi-source/multi-scale data and
models requires efﬁcient management platform. Hua et al. (2018) developed an
internet-based 3D geographic information service system for Hakka culture preser-
vation with data storage on the cloud and service functions such as scene loading
and browsing, thematic cultural map display, online virtual experiences for tours,
and tourist route navigation for users. The data sources were based on surveyed and
collected materials and knowledge of Hakka culture through ﬁeld work and the 3D
model of Tulou reconstructed with TLS, UAV and digital camera data. It provides
a virtual experience for a cultural tour in a 3D interactive way and a novel platform
for Hakka culture presentation, cognition and heritage.
Third, to enhance the vivid experience and the comprehension of the public,
Barsantietal.builtavirtualmuseumwith3DinteractivescenariosofEgyptianfuneral
objects that was exhibited at the Archaeological Museum in Milan (Barsanti et al.
2015) (Fig. 17.9). In this scenario, users could grab, wave and rotate 3D models to
observe them from different points of view with the movement of their virtual hands,
which was implemented by wearable virtual reality devices named HMD. In addition,
Eva et al. realized gesture-based natural interaction in a virtual reproduction of the
Regolini-Galassi tomb, one of the richest and most famous tombs of the Orientalizing
period (Pietroni et al. 2013). By exploiting the recognition of the skeleton and the
grammar of common gestures, this application leaves users completely free to walk
through the 3D scenes of the ancient cultural heritage site and dynamically choose
3D objects they are interested in with a gesture of their arms.
Fig. 17.9 Pictures of the implemented VR scenario: a, b grabbing and rotating of an object with
the option to enlargeit (following Barsanti et al. (2015))
584
X. Wang et al.
Furthermore, in most outdoor cases, users are inclined to compare the current
site with the immemorial one that shared the same location with it, so that they can
infer the changes that occurred over time. To address this issue and allow for the
capability of combining the natural world and artiﬁcial world, augmented reality
technology appears to be a suitable choice. Quattrini et al. (2016) reconstructed a
Roman theatre in Italy using TLS point cloud data and validated the 3D models
using a geometrical survey of evidence. Moreover, they showed how it is possible
to realize on-site visualization of cultural heritage that no longer exists based on a
mobile augmented reality (MAR) platform (Quattrini et al. 2016) (Fig. 17.10).
Notably, the whole life cycle of cultural heritage is a complex historical pro-
cess that includes site selection, construction, completion, maintenance, and the cur-
rent physical restoration, which comprises both natural processes and human activ-
ities. For example, the EU’s Seventh R&D Framework Program ofﬁcially launched
research on the impacts of natural processes (climate change) on historical and cul-
turalheritage(http://www.climateforculture.eu/index.php?inhalt=project.overview).
To effectively recognize the temporal and spatial characteristics of cultural heritage,
it is particularly important to develop and construct a dynamic knowledge environ-
ment. The dynamic knowledge environment requires integrated sensors for real-time
observation, geographic process simulation and prediction, and agent behavior anal-
ysis methods and techniques to provide comprehensive analysis capabilities that
can trace the past and more effectively predict the socialization process of cultural
heritage.

Italy, using Layar. (following Quattrini et al. (2016))
17
Digital Heritage
585
The effective solution of the above challenges rely on the development of related
technologies such as the acquisition and digitization of cultural heritage related infor-
mation, seamless integration of multisource/multi-scale data and models, non-rigid
physical modeling and its free interaction and real-time response, space-time evo-
lution modeling of ancient sites and ancient civilization activities, and behavioral
model building. Narrowing the gap between high-tech virtual reality and cultural
heritage remains a challenge. Academician Huadong Guo of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences advocated constructing and developing spatial archaeology, an interdis-
ciplinary ﬁeld combining the strengths of spatial technology, cultural heritage, big
data science, and computer technology, which practically applies new and sophis-
ticated technology to heritage protection and sustainable development. At present,
the pilot project “the Earth Big Data Science Project” of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, which oversees Academician Guo Huadong, has been set up to support
related research on heritage protection along the Belt and Road. It will reproduce
the past glory of the ancient civilization of the Belt and Road through the virtual
reproduction of digital heritage.
17.4
The Development Trend of Digital Heritage
Cultural and natural heritage are the precious wealth of mankind, and the primary
condition of heritage protection is to ensure the authenticity and integrity of heritage.
Although digital technology applied to cultural and natural heritage, their preserva-
tion, protection, research and utilization provides an important support, digital her-
itage itself also faces issues such as data security, distribution, interoperability, cost,
simpliﬁcation and speed problems for application. It is also a challenge to open access
and increase the ease of understanding. The preservation and protection of digital her-
itage involve technology and methods for preservation and protection, management
systems, protection schemes, and management measures and laws regarding the pro-
tection of digital heritage. The future development of digital heritage preservation,
protection, research and utilization has the following trends.
17.4.1
The Depiction of Heritage Objects via Remote Sensing
Technology Is Becoming Increasingly Precise
Multi-platforms of satellite, airborne and ground remote sensing have increasingly
higher spatial resolution. The development of multi-spectrum and hyper-spectrum
technology has made object characterization more and more precise. Coupled with
the progress of data processing technology and cognitive methods, the recognition
of the geometry and attributes of natural and cultural heritage is closer to the actual
items.
586
X. Wang et al.
Especially in recent years, rapid development of laser radar technology as a new
means of three-dimensional space data acquisition that can perform complex surface
measurement quickly and accurately and obtain a record of the sites of cultural
relics that is high-density, high-precision and three-dimensional, representing the
information of cultural heritage sites truly, accurately and completely. In addition,
hyper-spectrum data will become increasingly important in the ﬁne classiﬁcation of
natural and cultural heritage. There will be great potential in the future for natural
and cultural heritage information acquisition based on the fusion of hyperspectral
information and LiDAR elevation information.
17.4.2
The Demand for Durable Digital Heritage
Preservation Media Will Continue to Drive Innovation
How can advanced technology be used to monitor and protect valuable cultural and
natural heritage, and what is the best medium for preserving such data? As early as
the 1970s, people began to use photography, video and other technologies to record
information about natural processes and cultural relics. However, these data are difﬁ-
cult to preserve for a long time due to the aging of videotapes, disk demagnetization,
and image reproduction that produces distortion. In the late 20th century, with the
emergence of virtual reality technology and the rapid development of networks,
the heritage protection industry has a new opportunity—high-precision and high-
ﬁdelity digital heritage preservation technology. Modern high-quality digital image
technology and advanced graphic image processing methods have brought the pro-
tection of natural and cultural heritage into a new era. Image-based rendering (IBR)
and image-based modeling (IBM), three-dimensional scanning-based reconstruction
and roaming, retrieval/restoration/color technology, multiple projection immersive
virtual environment and other technologies have made digital natural and cultural
heritage become a reality and have great potential in future applications of digital
natural and cultural heritage.
17.4.3
Data Integration, Development, Publication
and Dissemination for Heritage Protection Platform
Software Urgently Need to Be Developed
To make full use of different sensors (obtained from aviation, space, and the ground),
3D models, airborne data, and ground laser scanning data, using a GIS environment
and software to manage and integrate the available information (digital and the digi-
tal format) and synthesize, reﬁne, comprehensively develop, and release multisource
data (excavation reports, geophysical surveys, mapping, aviation and satellite pho-
tography) can provide effective solutions.
17
Digital Heritage
587
GIS environments or web-based GIS environment tools provide new and more
efﬁcient ways to conduct archaeological research, store and process data, and share
multisource geospatial data collaboratively. To develop infrastructure, new meth-
ods and concepts are needed to handle the increasing big data and data integration
requirements, the requirement of efﬁcient archive processing and the simpliﬁcation
of GIS-based technology applications. These problems can be solved via building
open source components based on the WebGIS platform. With the rapid develop-
ment of archaeological WebGIS today, the combination and usage increase of related
archaeological applications is occurring. Many platforms with various interfaces and
functions have been created for professional and nonprofessional users.
WebGIS architecture provides ﬂexible tools for multiple requirements, applica-
tions, and usage phases. The open source tools of WebGIS have played an important
role for different application purposes in recent years, for example, a the release of
mining results; b the design of archaeological clues to the land; and c the incorpora-
tion of archaeological data into the broader national geological portal for landscape
conservation purposes.
A system platform and database for monitoring, evaluation, decision-making and
exhibition of natural and cultural heritage are an expectation of researchers, users
and the public around the world. The Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) Working Group
(DBAR-Heritage) is developing such a platform.
17.4.4
Increasingly Convenient Digital Technologies Are
Adapted to Non-professional and Wide Public
Participation in Heritage Conservation
The growing availability of free data and open access software tools has strengthened
the link between ﬁeld surveys and computer analysis, providing new opportunities
for the conservation, development and utilization of natural and cultural heritage
sites. The key point is to create accessible tools for different people, including the
domain expert groups (archaeologists, remote sensing experts, regulators, museums)
and non-professional users, for tourism and education purposes concerning regional
natural and cultural heritage of the people. In addition, the effective interoperability
between different computer platforms, executing a program or data transmission
between various functional units should allow for the user to have little or no need to
understand the characteristics of these units. Related operations can also be hosted in
the cloud by sending images to a remote powerful server and, after a short period of
post-processing, the design model can be previewed. This makes digital archaeology
work less exclusive than in the past, which makes it easier for government decision
makers, schoolteachers and the public to use data and offers the possibility of wider
participation.

Quantitative Research Based on the Value Assessment
of Natural and Cultural Heritage via Digital
Technology
Although the important role and signiﬁcance of natural heritage in the ecological
balance, scientiﬁc research, scientiﬁc popularization, natural aesthetics and tourism
and leisure are difﬁcult to estimate, some ﬁelds can be evaluated. In terms of eco-
logical value, especially large natural heritage plays an extremely important role in
the conservation of species and the ecological value of regional and global signif-
icance. The earth is an organic whole, and local destruction can affect the local or
wider ecological environments. Although we may not see any examples of such local
destruction causing an obvious overall imbalance, the changes in Antarctic glaciers
and even mountain glaciers caused by current climate changes has been a “wake-up
call” (e.g. Kaser et al. (2004)).
For both tangible cultural heritage and intangible cultural heritage, the value is
diversiﬁed. The intangible cultural heritage of language, handicrafts, performance
art and other forms of cultural expression make successive human knowledge to
be realized from generation to generation. The result of the accumulation of knowl-
edge greatly promoted human progress. Tangible and cultural heritage is the tangible
evidence for humans to know themselves. The archaeological analysis and recon-
struction of the physical remains (including artifacts, buildings, etc.) and their related
living environments and cultural landscapes have led to the rediscovery of some lost
ancient civilizations. The great value of cultural heritage must also be explored fur-
ther.
Examples of the multiple values of nature and cultural heritage are numerous.
Due to the large spaces, time spans and complex situations, quantitative research has
not been well conducted. For quantitative research on the value of cultural heritage
and natural heritage based on digital technology, the formation of a system and a
standard are a possible and urgent innovation issue.
17.4.6
The Study of Effective Protection of Digital Heritage
and Legal Protection Is Becoming Increasingly
Urgent
At present, the main problems in the protection of digital heritage come from two
aspects. One is the problem that researchers’ understanding of the value of digital
heritage is insufﬁcient. The value of the digital information of heritage may not be
recognized before it disappears or changes and it is too late to provide effective
protection. Digital data may be well preserved, but the identiﬁcation and description
may be so poor that potential users cannot ﬁnd them. As the independence of data
and data processing applications cannot be conﬁrmed, the use of data is reduced.
The second aspect is the problem of incomplete preservation of digital heritage due
17
Digital Heritage
589
to insufﬁcient funds and responsibilities. No one is responsible for the information,
or the person responsible may lack the knowledge, systems or policy frameworks
needed to perform their duties. Information is vulnerable to disasters such as ﬁres,
equipment failures, ﬂoods, viruses or direct attacks that disable storage equipment or
operating systems; measures such as password protection, encryption, and security
devices will cause data to be unavailable when they are not applied.
Cyber space generated by the internet is a kind of living form that has not been
experienced by humans. It will have an inestimable impact on contemporary and
future human beings. Due to the openness and sharing of resource information in
the network environment, anyone can obtain the desired information in any place by
some means. Digital heritage is faced with the problem of destructiveness caused by
openness and sharing. In addition, the problem of infringement occurs relatively eas-
ily. As a kind of digital heritage with the characteristics of cultural heritage, the owner
of its property rights should be protected by the corresponding laws. Infringement in
the network is different from general infringement. Due to the disguised characteris-
tics of network information transmission channels, the copyright and communication
rights of digital heritage easily lead to infringement caused by the transmission of
digital heritage without the permission of property owners. Therefore, it is necessary
to systematically form international legal documents and universal legal protection
of digital heritage.

Citizen Science in Support of Digital
Earth
Maria Antonia Brovelli, Marisa Ponti, Sven Schade and Patricia Solís
Abstract Citizen science can be thought of as a tremendous catalyst for making Dig-
ital Earth a participation model of our world. This chapter presents a wide overview
of the concept and practice of citizen science in terms of the technologies and social
impact. Deﬁnitions of citizen science and various existing approaches to citizen
involvement are described, from simple contributions to projects proposed by some-
one else to the design and planning of science as a bottom-up process. To illustrate
these concepts, the relevant example of OpenStreetMap is described in detail, and
other examples are mentioned and brieﬂy discussed. Social innovation connected
with citizen science is focused on to highlight different levels of direct citizen con-
tributions to scientiﬁc research and indirect effects on academia, and studies driven
by new questions that may support responsible research and innovation (RRI), gov-
ernments and public administration in making better informed decisions. Despite its
growth and success in relatively few years, citizen science has not fully overcome a
number of persistent challenges related to quality, equity, inclusion, and governance.
These themes and related complex facets are discussed in detail in the last section of
the chapter.

The Digital Earth vision has evolved from a digital replica of the earth that enables
knowledge sharing and simulation (Gore 1999) to a blending of our physical world
with digital representations of past, present and possible future realities (Goodchild

et al. 2012; Craglia et al. 2012; Ehlers et al. 2014). Digital Earth thereby provides
innovative ways of interacting with our real and virtual environments. These interac-
tions support different forms of decision-making and enable new approaches of data
and knowledge cocreation and facilitate dialogue between conﬂicting communities
(Ehlers et al. 2014). This chapter is dedicated to the possibilities for active contri-
bution that Digital Earth offers citizens, with a special focus on the relationships
between Digital Earth and public participation in scientiﬁc research (also known as
citizen science).
First, central deﬁnitions for citizen science, crowdsourcing and volunteered geo-
graphic information (VGI) are elaborated. A detailed analysis of a crowdsourcing
and VGI application (OpenStreetMap—OSM) provides concrete practical insights
on the roles of communities and institutions, technical considerations, and data qual-
ity. Following this example, the view is widened to other approaches and categories
of citizen science and their relationship to Digital Earth. Additional considerations
are taken into account and brieﬂy expanded to wider concepts such as social innova-
tion and public engagement. The chapter concludes with a summary and lists central
challenges for future research.
This chapter addresses citizen science broadly, but additional information about
citizen science in the European context is presented in Chap. 20. Citizen science
addresses the direct and self-conscious participation of people (citizens) in scien-
tiﬁc research—which makes it considerably different from passive contributions to
research that are carried out by third parties, for example, in the case of social media
analysis (see Chap. 12).
18.2
Deﬁnitions
To fully understand the value and potential impact of citizen science, it is necessary
to consider at least three relevant phenomena of the last twenty years. The ﬁrst
is Wikipedia, the free wiki encyclopedia, which was created in 2001 (Kock et al.
2016). Just over a decade later, in 2013, it had become such a successful enterprise
that an asteroid was named after it (Workman 2013). Wikipedia currently boasts
approximately 79 Million registered users and is probably the most widely known
and used encyclopedia. By deﬁnition, an encyclopedia is a narrative model of the
world that includes all human knowledge, and had always been written by scholars.
As a result of new technology and the collaboration of volunteers (who are not
necessarily scholars), Wikipedia has become the largest encyclopedia, written in a
few short years.
A second example is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an oper-
ational system that is very relevant for the environmental challenges addressed by
Digital Earth. The GBIF was founded in 2001 upon the recommendation of the Bio-
diversity Informatics Subgroup of the Megascience Forum and subsequent endorse-
ment by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
science ministers (GBIF 2011). Today, the GBIF has evolved into a renowned data
18
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth
595
infrastructure and single access point for biodiversity data (Robertson et al. 2014),
much of which originates from volunteer citizen scientists (Chandler et al. 2017).
According to its website, the GBIF provides access to almost 45 thousand data sets,
including more than 1.3 billion species observation records. This tremendous source
of knowledge has led to the publication of more than three-and-a-half thousand
peer-reviewed scientiﬁc publications.
A third notable example is OpenStreetMap project, which is a free map of the
world. Before considering the history and success of this initiative, it must be noted
that mapping was a prerogative of governments (mainly for military purposes and
land taxation) and that, in some countries both then and now, military forces hold the
legislated national monopoly on mapping services. The knowledge of the territory
and the science of “where” are a way to monitor and control territory. In this context,
OSM represents a complete change of paradigm: everybody contributes to mapping
the world; the map is free to everybody for every purpose. Created in 2004, OSM has
seen success equivalent to that of Wikipedia and approximately 5 million volunteers
have contributed to this project. OSM is the largest existing geospatial database.
These examples illustrate the social and technological environment in which the
concept and substance of citizen science are situated.
Although public participation in scientiﬁc achievements has a long history, recent
decades have seen greater attention and an impressive increase in the number of
people involved. The term citizen science was used in scientiﬁc papers in the mid-
1990s (Kerson 1989; Irwin 1995; Bonney 1996). The term was ﬁrst reported in
Wikipedia in 2005 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in (2014). It describes
the scientiﬁc work done by laypeople often with the collaboration or under the
supervision of scientists. (OED 2014).
However,citizenscienceisaverydiversepracticethatencompassesvariousforms,
depths and aims of collaboration between scientists and public researchers in a broad
range of scientiﬁc disciplines. There are different classiﬁcations of citizen science
projects based on the degrees of inﬂuence and contributions of the public.
Shirk et al. (2012) classiﬁed projects into different models based on the degree of
participation:
(1) contributory projects, which are mostly data collection;
(2) collaborative projects, involving data collection and project design reﬁnement,
data analysis, and disseminating results;
(3) cocreated projects, designed together by scientists and the public, and the public
participates in most or all of the steps in a scientiﬁc project or process; and
(4) collegial projects, developed by noncredentialed individuals conducting
research independently with varying degrees of expected recognition by sci-
entists.
Haklay et al. (2018a, b) distinguish projects in three different classes:
(5) long-running citizen science, which are traditional projects similar to those run
in the past (Kobori et al. 2016; Bonney et al. 2009);
(6) citizen cyberscience, strictly connected with the usage of technologies (Grey
2009), which can be subclassiﬁed as follows:
596
M. A. Brovelli et al.
(6.1) volunteer computing, where citizens offer the unused computing
resources of their computers;
(6.2) volunteer thinking, where citizens offer their cognitive abilities for per-
forming tasks that are difﬁcult for machines; and
(6.3) passive sensing, where citizens use sensors integrated into mobile com-
puting devices to carry out automatic sensing tasks.
(7) community science, involving a greater commitment of citizens in designing
and planning project activities in a more egalitarian (if not bottom-up) approach
between scientists and citizen scientists (Jepson and Ladle 2015; Figueiredo
Nascimento et al. 2014; Breen et al. 2015). This can be divided into the follow-
ing:
(7.1) participatory sensing, where citizens use the sensors integrated into
mobile computing devices to carry out sensing tasks;
(7.2) Do-it-yourself (DIY) science, in which participants create their own sci-
entiﬁc tools and methodology to carry out studies; and
(7.3) civic science, the science built on the needs and expectations of the com-
munity (Haklay et al. 2018a, b).
In addition to citizen science, the term crowdsourcing (or geo crowdsourcing
or crowdsourcing geographic information) is used. The general term (with no geo-
graphic declination) was coined in 2005 to describe the outsourcing and spreading,
generally through an open call, of a job previously made by a worker to the crowd,
i.e. a large group of people (Saﬁre 2009). When related to the location, it refers to
a new source of geographic information that has become available in the form of
user-generated content accessible over the Internet.
Citizen science considers the process as a whole, and attention is paid to the
community of contributors. Geo-crowdsourcing also considers the contributed data
and their condition of usage. In some cases, the contributors (e.g., when they are using
Twitter, Instagram, Facebook or Google trafﬁc) are unaware that they are contributing
toaproject:theysimplywanttocommunicatewithfriendsandrelatives(intheformer
cases) or to ﬁnd directions and trafﬁc conditions (in the latter case). Thus, they are
treated more like moving sensors than human beings. The person is an appendix
of the sensor and not vice versa. The user-generated data can be provided as open
to everybody or (more often) used by the service provider for analytics for diverse
purposes. For instance, in the case of Google, one advantage could be to build a
powerful database for self-driving cars.
Considering the (re)use potential of citizen science contributions, issues related
to ﬁtness for the purpose and data quality should be discussed. Those who are new to
the ﬁeld of citizen science often doubt the quality of the results produced. However, it
has been shown on numerous occasions that citizen science can deliver high-quality
information (Kelling et al. 2015; Bell et al. 2015; Senaratne et al. 2017), and provide
new knowledge that could not be gathered with any other approach (see, for example,
Walther and Kampen 2017). Literature on data management, quality assurance, and

(CS); and ‘openstreetmap’
the provision of accompanying metadata is available for a wide variety of application
ﬁelds (see, for example, Bastin et al. 2017, 2018; and Williams et al. 2018).
Notably, the term “citizen science” is not uncontested in the sense that the term
“citizen” evokes a normative role of what it means to belong to and act as a member
of a particular social group, including implications of what it means to participate in
public science projects for “noncitizen” residents (e.g., Woolley et al. 2016). These
perspectives are not just rhetorical, as labels matter in practical terms if actors such as
refugees or resident immigrants participate in contributing. In contrast to the previous
terms, volunteered geographic information highlights the active attitude of people
when contributing data. VGI was proposed in 2007 and includes examples such as
WikiMapia and OSM.
To evaluate the rapid evolution of terms related to user-generated content, Fig. 18.1
shows Google Scholar results for references that match the terms ‘volunteered geo-
graphic information’; ‘geo crowdsourced’ and ‘crowdsourced geographic informa-
tion’; ‘citizen science’; and ‘openstreetmap’ are reported. The growth over time is
impressive. Moreover, the success of a single project, OSM, is also relevant and
deserves more thorough exploration within this chapter.
18.3
Digital Earth Technologies for Citizen Science
The previous deﬁnitions allow for speciﬁcation of the possible roles of Digital Earth
as an enabler of citizen engagement—especially for citizen science. Digital Earth
technologies provide citizens with advanced sensing devices (see the Chap. 11 on
the Internet of Things) and mobile applications that allow for data collection by any-
one who possesses a smart device or acquires a sampling tool. In addition, the use
598
M. A. Brovelli et al.
of existing social media platforms helps people collect data about a wide range of
phenomena, including natural hazards, crop production and the spread of diseases.
Following the Digital Earth vision, these data streams can be interconnected and
real-time deliveries can be assimilated with data from complementary sources such
as authoritative measurement stations or remote sensing imagery. Accordingly, data
contributed by citizen scientists might help improve models about our environment
(e.g., for air quality, water quality or extreme events) by ground truthing or valida-
tion—or by providing additional data points that are used for improved geographic
predictions or forecasting. These possible contributions of citizen science could be
considered the Digital Earth Nervous System—DENS (De Longueville et al. 2010).
The concept of VGI ﬁts well into this kind of Digital Earth support for citizen
science. VGI platforms can be viewed as a part of the Digital Earth infrastructure, but
the uptake and use of VGI in combination with data from other sources are essential.
In addition, crowdsourced data directly connects to this view, as data is passively
collected before it is used as part of a dynamic and intertwined ﬂow of stimuli and
contextual information that is integrated into a gigantic knowledge base that keeps
the pulse of our planet. User location information is a direct and obvious example.
While protecting privacy, valuable information can be derived that, in combination
with other data sources, can provide valuable decision support. For example, real-
time locations can help optimize green transport or save lives in a crisis situation by
individually guiding evacuees along safe routes or sending rescue teams to locations
where they are most needed.
Transitioning from pure data collection, Digital Earth technology can also help
other dimensions of citizen science. Once data is collected, Digital Earth could pro-
vide access to artiﬁcial intelligence that could be used for quality control, which
is frequently demanded in citizen science. In this area of citizen science activities,
automated algorithms can help assess the probability of a certain measurement or
observation. For example, automated image recognition (based on machine learn-
ing) could analyze pictures of plants recorded by a participant and suggest the most
likely species. This could also take into account when and where a record was made.
Similarly, an algorithm might calculate risks based on ﬁndings from citizen science.
For example, it might calculate the risks associated with a possible new sighting of
an invasive alien species in an area where it has not been reported yet. Thus, auto-
mated support can help overcome the current difﬁculties in ﬁnding enough expertise
to validate species information.
With respect to the next possible area of citizen science activities, Digital Earth
technologies—especially visualizations—can help people analyze available data sets
and display them in context. Offering multiple visualization techniques and map-
based integrations with related information can help explore the latest information
available and identify possible correlations or other dependencies. Visual approaches
(with maps and graphs) might also help communicate the scientiﬁc ﬁndings to a

Digital Earth as an enabler for citizen engagement can be reached. With this fully

their preferred device to experience a certain situation, simulate possible decisions,
and immediately assess the possible impacts. Such an advanced functionality can
facilitate debates between any physically connected or remote group of people. In
such settings, knowledge can be cocreated and experimented with and situations can
be reassessed. In such a way, Digital Earth can create a safe space of interaction and
cocreation to arrive at group decision-making before taking concrete actions in the
real world.
Concerning the use of citizen-contributed knowledge, Digital Earth provides
another essential enabler, namely, the possibility to track and trace data through
processing chains and its use for decision-making. This traceability is fundamental
to provide feedback to citizen scientists about the use of their data.

OpenStreetMap
18.4.1
Social Ecosystem
OpenStreetMap is one of the most well-known and researched examples of a vol-
unteered geographic project in which data is crowdsourced at a global scale. Many
people consider OSM to be an object or to be the free map of the world, which is con-
tributed by volunteers and is available for everyone, being based on an open-content
license (OpenStreetMap Wiki Contributors 2017). However, it is also commonly
thought of as a data platform where as many as 5 million users contribute, edit,
download and assess the data that are shared. As opposed to a map or platform,
many others consider it an “online project,” a perspective that refocuses attention
on the efforts to create the map instead of the map or database itself. Others, who
are often part of the project, speak of “OpenStreetMap” as a community, emphasiz-
ing the set of actors responsible for its existence. OSM should be thought of as a
community of communities, (Solís 2017) in the sense that this community is increas-
ingly diverse and incorporates the motivations of many different groups with varied
approaches to OSM. Together with the technology products and systems, they form
a complex sociotechno ecosystem that operates as a multiscalar network (Vespignani
2009). There are ﬂuidities in the kinds of actors that participate in OpenStreetMap,
which can be generally categorized and thought of (see Table 18.1) using typical
descriptors such as sector-based characteristics: private enterprise, for-proﬁt entities,
nonproﬁt or civil society, and government or public institutions at various scales. It
can also be categorized by community through their modality of engagement with
OSM: those who directly create map data, locally and/or remotely, entities that add
value through map-based services and third-party open source software, algorithms,
scripts, or materials, consumers of the data, including individual users exporting for
a discrete use, companies that run their navigation or social media platforms live

with underlying OSM data, and governments that download data for comparison in
ofﬁcial geodataset validations. These categories are not mutually exclusive, as a sin-
gle individual or organization often operates in more than one sector and engages in
multiple modalities over the course of interaction with OSM, and thus, understanding
this social ecosystem is highly complex. Furthermore, in the construction of com-
munities in the OSM community, the way that social bonds formed around purposes
(e.g., the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team’s humanitarian mission), identity (e.g.,
YouthMappers academic actors and GeoChicas), or place must also be considered
as another dimension of connectedness.
For example, one set of these communities that has experienced tremendous
growth recently are the communities that engage with the OSM community with
an express humanitarian or development purpose. Beginning with the incorporation
of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) in the international civil soci-
ety sector, which formed in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake,
various groups have begun to distinguish and highlight the purposeful creation of
volunteered spatial data rather than the creation of open data for its own sake. HOT
has since registered as a nonproﬁt organization and has a structured governance com-
prising a core group of voting members that support a larger set of global volunteers
with speciﬁc local and remote mapping campaigns. The Missing Maps project was
later founded by HOT, Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, and the
American and British Red Cross agencies. Similar to other purpose-driven efforts,
this project aims to map the world’s most vulnerable people. It has since grown to
include participation from other organizations, and has developed a presence as a
related OSM community in its own right, with close ties to HOT.
The participation of university actors intersecting with this purposefully human-
itarian community was present, even if not consolidated, from the outset; in 2014,
the academic community developed YouthMappers to explicitly bring together and
nurture the community of students and their faculty that operate within and together
with the broader set of OSM communities around youth-based identities. Founded by
faculty from Texas Tech University, The George Washington University, and West
Virginia University, with support from the US Agency for International Develop-
ment’s GeoCenter, and now administered by Arizona State University, YouthMap-
pers organize as chapters on university campuses, run by student leadership under
the guidance of university professor mentors. Chapters apply for recognition by the
YouthMappers steering committee as existing student organizations that afﬁliate or
as newly formed student-led groups. The network encourages students to partici-
pate in global remote campaigns of USAID, HOT and other humanitarian groups,
develop and implement local mapping campaigns that create and use geospatial data
for needs at the local or national levels, and seek and provide resources for students to
expand their volunteerism through internships, leadership development, and research
fellowships. Activities center on the concept of not just building maps, but building
mappers and promoting exchange and solidarity among student peers across con-
tinents. Campaigns create data directly for development programming and seek to
promote greater inclusion and participation of students from countries in develop-
ment as well as female mappers via the #LetGirlsMap campaigns. By late 2018, the
602
M. A. Brovelli et al.
network had grown to 143 campus chapters in 41 countries, linking more than 5,000
OSM volunteers. Although the YouthMappers purpose falls along the humanitarian
or development realm, where activities are deﬁned as contributions to global targets
such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Solís et al. 2018), the community
has a strong identity-based composition, as participants are students in universities
and learning through the mapping experience carries signiﬁcant import (Hite et al.
2018; Coetzee et al. 2018). Similarly, consolidating community space for particular
actors within the social ecosystem of OSM, GeoChicas formed at the State of the Map
Latin America conference in 2016. GeoChicas is a group of women who volunteer
map in OSM and work to close the signiﬁcant gender gap within the OSM com-
munity. Their activities promote mapping campaigns that address women’s issues
such as mapping gender violence and promote female participation by creating more
training spaces for women and ensuring harassment-free mapping. They also raise
awareness of OSM technical matters such as tagging in support of women and girls
in the OSM map and data platform.
An impressive example of a place-based community is Crowd2Map Tanzania,
which was established in 2015 to improve the rural maps of Tanzania to ﬁght female
genital mutilation and improve development of the region. The community of volun-
teers creating OSM data in the context of Crowd2Map intersects with all of the above
communities (HOT, Missing Maps, YouthMappers chapters in Tanzania, GeoChi-
cas), especially local residents. This demonstrates how the communities of OSM
engage and create a multiplicity of volunteer impacts within the social ecosystem of
OSM.
End-user communities are important in shaping OSM institutionally and should
not be underestimated because they are not actively involved in the construction and
constitution of OSM. This community is much more difﬁcult to track and assess,
since OSM is free and open for anyone to use. In addition to the user-contributor
communities noted above, governmental entities, including at the very small scale
such as local civil protection agencies, local disaster response units, and local busi-
nesses, are using OSM data in their functions. At the country scale, actors such as
national mapping agencies incorporate OSM data with ofﬁcial data sources, espe-
cially in times of urgency such as disaster response, e.g., the earthquake in Ecuador
in 2016 where OSM data supplemented with ofﬁcial data was used to validate or gap-
ﬁll missing data. Multinational organizations such as the World Bank span local to
global categories, considering the city-level action that work such as the Open Cities
Project supports. The participation of governments and the public sector is signiﬁcant
due to the unique challenges for such actors and communities of actors for adopting
crowdsourced geographic data, despite its potential value. The landscape of partici-
pation among governments has been highly dynamic in recent years, as the reliability
and accuracy of volunteered data has been increasingly seen as appropriate for (to
inform or accompany) ofﬁcial use. Obstacles remain; most recently, Haklay et al.
(2018a, b) conducted qualitative comparative analysis of multiple use case studies to
identify success factors for users with governance missions. The use cases included
activities such as base mapping or focus on a particular area of interest, generating
updates to authoritative datasets, upgrading public services, policy development or
18

reporting, and disaster management or response. The authors ﬁnd that individual
champions and change agents are critical, organizational business models are nec-
essary, technical capacity is essential, and conceptual buy-into acceptance of issues
such as uncertainty, collaboration, and new ways of serving the public good must
accompany this community’s involvement in open Digital Earth landscapes.
On a broader scale, the user policies and open license of OSM provide a public
good that commercial and for-proﬁt enterprises are keen to leverage or even support
in some cases. This is unsurprising in a rapidly growing context where geospatial
information is valued as a multibillion dollar industry (Eddy 2014). With an Open
Database License, adopted in 2010, OSM is enabled and simultaneously constrained
for use in the private sector, and thus, calls for more “business-friendly” approaches
are not uncommon (Gale 2015). The range of themes, applications, and industries
in this sector are broad and growing and are difﬁcult to comprehensively capture.
The inclusion of the OSM layer as a base map in widely used proprietary geospatial
software (such as ArcGIS Online) and examples of OSM powering services such as
Craigslist and The Weather Channel show that the public may be consuming this
volunteer-contributed content base without much awareness. Passive users are less
affected by licensing frameworks than actors that seek to build services or add value
and comingle data sources and types, who must contend with share-alike clauses.
Explicit commercial contributors to the OSM ecosystem include companies that
offer commercial OSM software and services that expressly add value to OSM in
terms of architecture, analysis, visualization, and/or consulting on a multinational,
regional or, very frequently, worldwide scope. Although Google Maps still dom-
inates web mapping, OSM has captured approximately 0.1% of the market share
of web mapping, which is impressive for a community that is completely powered
by volunteer contributors (iDataLabs 2017). Top industries include IT software and
services and Internet companies, with revenues reaching the $200 M range. Nearly
one third of companies have fewer than 10 employees, and Germany, the US, France,
and the UK currently account for 40% of estimated formal business activity. How-
ever, as OSM grows, its presence in lower-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) is
increasing, as the ability to access scarce geospatial data and location-based infor-
mation is gaining traction as an international economic development strategy in the
context of digital development (USAID 2018). Open geospatial data such as OSM
powers businesses in real estate, transportation, agriculture, and technology in 177
countries (Bliss 2015), and the corporate sector sees OSM as a priority in the open
source community (Moody 2018). The increasing presence and inﬂuence of large-
scale commercial or for-proﬁt entities within the OSM community of communities
is changing the countenance of the social ecosystem in ways that are sometimes con-
tradictory and contested. The OSM Foundation, as the nonproﬁt entity that exists to
protect, promote and support the project (though it does not own the data), continues
to navigate this complex array of actors, visions, uses, and contributors in a dynamic
landscape of volunteered geographic information.

18.4.2
Technological Ecosystem
One of the main reasons for the success of OSM is that the technology behind
the project allows for everybody to contribute regardless of their level of expertise.
More than a simple geospatial crowdsourced database, OSM is an ecosystem of
data, software and web-based information stores. The tools and systems developed
by different actors in the social ecosystem of OSM are generally characterized as
being free and open source, i.e., available for further development by other people in
the community. Access to the different applications is often possible using the same
personal account as that for the OSM platform.
The geometric OSM data model is easy and simple, based on simple data types
such as nodes, ways (polygons and polylines) and relations (logical collections of
ways and nodes). The semantic model, i.e., the nonspatial attributes associated with
the geometric objects, is more complex but services such as the taginfo (Open-
StreetMap Contributors 2018a) help contributors to choose the most appropriate
tags (key/value pairs). As an example, the most basic and common representation
for a building is by means of a way and the pair: “building = yes”.
After signing up for free access to OSM (OpenStreetMap Contributors 2018b),
users can begin contributing by mapping new data in OSM or editing existing data
stored in the OSM geospatial database. In December 2018, there were more than 5
million users (OpenStreetMap Stats 2018). There are three ways to contribute:
(1) by physically surveying an area and inserting the information collected by GPS
receivers and paper-based tools into the OSM database;
(2) by digitizing objects into the OSM platform using available aerial and satellite
imagery; and
(3) by bulk-importing suitably licensed geospatial data.
The ﬁrst two modalities are more generally used whereas the third must be coor-
dinated with the OSM community.
Many guides and tutorials on how to map with OSM are available; excellent
examples include those made available by the company Mapbox (Mapbox 2018)
and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT 2018).
Editing and visualization are the two basic functionalities for interacting with
the OSM geospatial database. The choices are very broad for both and depend on
the exigencies and skill of the user. As the OSM platform has an editing API, many
editors have been developed, some with a simpliﬁed subset of functionality and others
that operate on speciﬁc platforms such as mobile technology (OpenStreetMap Wiki
Contributors 2018a). The three main editors are iD, which is the default editor for
the user when accessing the OSM platform and is meant for beginners; MAPS.ME,
which is an app for iOS, Android and BlackBerry designed mainly for travelers, with
more than 50,000,000 installations, that provides ofﬂine maps and a straightforward
editor (Maps.me 2018); and JOSM (Java OpenStreetMap Editor), which is a desktop
application popular among expert editors because of its more advanced performance
(JOSM 2018).
18
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth
605
In addition to enabling individual contributions, the OSM technical ecosystem is
designed to elicit and simplify collaboration among contributors. One fundamental
tool for this purpose is the Tasking Manager developed by HOT (HOTOSM Com-
munity 2018).
The main purpose of this tool is the subdivision of a large area into smaller areas,
which require less time and effort to map. Individual contributors work on smaller
areas to avoid problems of overlap and confusion. Moreover, the Tasking Manager
allows for a second level of contribution: validation of the mapping of other users.
Validation is generally done by expert OSM users and consists of verifying the
geometric and semantic accuracy of the mapped objects and reviewing the mapping
for completeness.
The Tasking Manager has a graphical interface that shows the main characteristics
for every project (status, project creator, last updates, difﬁculty, priority, types of
mapping, organization, campaign, and contribution level required) and the map with
activity and stats. Figure 18.2 shows the example of Typhoon Ompong: Cagayan and
Batanes Structures (task: #5236) as published on 6 October 2018. The map helps
contributors know where to edit or validate, depending on their role.
TeachOSM is another site eliciting collaboration that is useful, but not limited,
to educators (TeachOSM 2018). It is another instance of the HOT Tasking Manager
and is used mostly by the academic and educational community. It provides training
documentation and resources that help instructors identify, assign, manage and grade
mapping assignments.

The OSM ecosystem provides many opportunities for collaborating, and the pos-
sibilities of using these data are many and various. The license of the project, Open
Database License (ODbL), permits free copying, distribution, transmission and adap-
tion of part or the whole dataset as long as credit is provided to OSM and its con-
tributors. If someone alters or builds upon OSM data, the results must be distributed
under the same license.
As noted above, this free and viral license has been pivotal in the development of
communities, research, and business around the project. Moreover, it has led to the
creation of a very wide range of applications.
Many visualization tools have been created with different sensitivities and needs:
rendering for cyclists, transportation maps, rendering for humanitarian purposes,
maps of speciﬁc collections (hydrants, ﬁre stations, etc.), 3D maps and artistic maps
such as those provided by the US company Stamen (see Fig. 18.3).
Data can be downloaded in several ways. The ﬁrst option is to download in .osm
format directly from the OSM geoportal by selecting the area of interest and using the
“export”button.Asanalternative,thePlanet.osm(OpenStreetMapWikiContributors
2018b) ﬁle is released weekly and contains the entire global dataset. It is a big ﬁle,
almost 40 GB compressed. For the complete time-varying dataset, a full history
planet dump is made available at irregular intervals.
For selected downloads, Geofabrik (Geofabrik GmbH Karlsruhe 2018) provides
access to continental, national and regional data extracts as OSM raw data or in
shapeﬁle format and most of these ﬁles are updated daily. The same service is offered
by OSMaax (HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil 2018), through which OSM
data are downloadable in the most common GIS formats. The HOT Export Tool (HOT
Fig. 18.3 Stamen
watercolor rendering of
OSM data (Tiber River in
Rome)
18
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth
607
2018) creates customized extracts of up-to-date OSM data in various ﬁle formats,
with the limitation of at most 10 Million nodes.
Additionally, there are API calls to directly create, read, update and delete map
data for OSM (OpenStreetMap Wiki Contributors 2018c), and this provides software
developers and applications with the most up-to-date data available. The Overpass
API service (OpenStreetMap Wiki Contributors 2018d) allows clients to send queries
using a special API query language or a graphical interface and obtain the requested
data (which can be huge). The ecosystem also includes free and open source GIS
packages, for instance, QGIS. In this case, a plugin, QuickOSM, allows users to
extract customized OSM data.
The availability of the data and this rich technological ecosystem has created
opportunities to invent services and applications suited for different aims. In addition
to “traditional” routing services (for cars, bikes and pedestrians), there are customiz-
able ones. Among the many examples, Via Regina is a project related to “slow”
tourism (Brovelli et al. 2015), i.e., tourism based on environmentally friendly forms
of transportation, the appreciation of nature and the rediscovery of local history and
cultural identity. Using OSM as a database, customized routes according to the user’s
preferred points of interest (religious, civil, museums, rural, archaeological, military,
factory, panoramic, or geological) can be shown on the interactive map, as shown
in Fig. 18.4 (I Cammini della Regina 2018). Before departure, the user can create
a personalized itinerary according to her/his own choices, supported by other infor-
mation such as the slope of the route and the presence of suitable tourist services
(restaurants, hotels) in the area.
Furthermore, many other services unrelated to routing have been created. A
detailed list of services is available on the wiki section of OSM (OpenStreetMap
Wiki Contributors 2018e).
In conclusion, OSM is a very vital collaborative project with a ﬂourishing and
vibrant social ecosystem and a strong technologic support.
One of the main criticisms of this dataset is that, as a collaborative product created
mainly by citizens without formal qualiﬁcations, its quality has not been assessed
Fig. 18.4 Routing according to preferred points of interest (via Regina geoportal http://viaregina3.
como.polimi.it/ViaRegina/index-en.html)
608
M. A. Brovelli et al.
and therefore its usage can be detrimental for some applications. The assessment of
OSM is a hot research topic and the majority of scholars have compared the database
against authoritative ones. Whereas signiﬁcant attention has been paid to OSM posi-
tional accuracy assessment and completeness, fewer authors have investigated its
semantic, temporal and thematic accuracy and consistency (Antoniou and Skopeliti
2015) and none, to the best of our knowledge, have assessed all the elements of
data quality. Some scholars have sought alternative quality metrics through “ﬁtness
of purpose” tests (Wentz and Shimizu 2018; Solís et al. 2018) in ways that priori-
tize how the data are used over abstract technical attributes of ﬁdelity. The purpose
for mapping has been suggested to inﬂuence productivity and quality in surprising
ways: humanitarian mappers knowledgeable of the end use of the data may be on par
with respect to productivity and error rates relative to mappers who operate without
regard to purpose; however, they tend to make more and different kinds of errors,
although they are more conﬁdent in the quality of their work. The implications of this
so-called “do good effect”, where new volunteers may think they are doing well just
because they are doing good, holds signiﬁcant implications for tailoring the training
and quality control of new mappers motivated by humanitarian mapping purposes
(Solís and DeLucia 2019).
It is impossible to draw a unique conclusion about the spatial accuracy and com-
pleteness, although recent case studies of OSM have indicated that they are com-
parable to those of regional-scale ofﬁcial datasets (Brovelli and Zamboni 2018). In
other cases, for instance, in some developing countries, OSM is the only available
dataset and therefore comparisons are not possible. The activism of the communities
and attention paid to validation of the collected data (for brevity, many available
tools are not mentioned) gives hope for continuous improvement of this product, as
has occurred for other collaborative projects such as Wikipedia. As a practical rein-
forcement of our idea of “communities of communities” contributing in the scale-up
of this resource, the OpenStreetMap community recently issued guidelines (Open-
StreetMap Contributors 2019) for groups who are contributing collectively to the
resource, making the ethic that quality matters to OSM creators and users more
explicit and transparent.
18.4.3
Other Citizen Science Projects: Social Innovation
and Public Engagement
OSM is a ﬂagship example of citizen science. As noted above, although the primary
purpose is to collect up-to-date topographic and other spatial data, it has additional
beneﬁts such as community building and active citizenship. Turrini et al. (2018)
recently described the multiple beneﬁts of citizen science more formally (Fig. 18.5).
Their research examined how citizen science contributes to knowledge generation,
learning and civic participation. The contributions can be clearly identiﬁed for the
knowledge dimension, e.g., by the contributed data and quality control of OSM.
18
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth
609
Fig. 18.5 The threefold potential of citizen science (Source Turrini et al. 2018)
With respect to learning, citizen science contributes to scientiﬁc literacy and to the
improvement of topically related skills, e.g., those related to mapping. In addition,
self-organized learning and education networks such as Geo4All (OSGeo 2015)
for open geospatial software comprise this dimension. Lastly, civic participation is
stimulated and facilitated. The YouthMappers community is an excellent example of
this aspect of citizen science, as well as GeoChicas. The latter group adds different
perspectives and experiences about conceptions of gender and ways of participation
within the OSM community and analyze the roles, representation and participation of
women in OSM to ﬁnd a path of dialogue and close the gender gap. Improved gender
inclusion also promises to impact the map and data and, ultimately, the knowledge
products and decisions made with it (e.g., Holder 2018).
In addition to these multifold dimensions that materialize with different intensities
in all citizen science initiatives, the concept of citizen science covers a much wider set
of possibilities for (i) the public to understand and contribute to scientiﬁc research;
(ii) academia to research new questions and carry out Responsible Research and
Innovation (RRI); and (iii) governments and public administration to make better-
informed decisions.
Thedifferentformsofcontributionsofcitizenstoscienceislikelythemostdebated
and researched topic of citizen science. There are many different categorizations (see,
for example, Shirk and Bonney (2015) for an overview), within speciﬁc contexts and
justiﬁcations for existence. The framing introduced by Pocock and others (2017) is
the most self-explanatory to describe the relationship to the research process, see
also Fig. 18.6.
In addition, the relationship between academia and citizen science has been widely
discussed; see, for example, the report of the League of European Universities (LERU
2016) or Mitchell et al. (2017). The form and shape of these discussions clearly
depend on the way that citizen science is seen and embraced in different countries
around the globe. There is great diversity across cultural regions and between more-
610
M. A. Brovelli et al.
Fig. 18.6 Roy’s categories of citizen science (Source Pocock et al. 2017)
and less-developed countries. It is also closely related to where the funding for citizen
science comes from. For example, in Europe, the overarching topics of responsible
research and innovation (RRI) and the open science agenda are strong promoters
of citizen science—as is the funding of citizens’ observatories in the context of
innovative Earth Observation. In the US, citizen science is more often linked to open
innovation (Congress.gov 2016).
In regard to the uptake of citizen science by governmental organizations, there are
many different approaches (Schade et al. 2017). A possible overall model is sum-
marized in Fig. 18.7. In this framing, the typical elements of citizen science (data
gathering, quality control and analysis) are connected to the policy-making process.
This imposes a need to provide feedback about the inﬂuence on political decisions,
and creates an opportunity to consider citizen science to monitor the impacts of
those decisions. Such an “accountability cycle” could be imagined at any admin-
istrative level, municipalities, regions, nations, macroregions or the entire earth. It
can be distinguished by whether the contributing citizen science initiatives are initi-
ated from the top down (i.e., on request by governmental institutions) or bottom-up
(i.e., by an active citizenry that wants to raise an issue or challenge a governmental
decision). Both approaches have success stories, and they face different challenges.
Top-down approaches often have issues about acceptance or community uptake or
buy-in. Bottom-up approaches often face difﬁculty in reaching the relevant decision
makers or being taken seriously.
Given the multifaceted nature of citizen science, its relationships to the notion
of Digital Earth are manifold. As set forth in the visionary work on the European
18
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth

Fig. 18.7 Cyclic value chain of citizen science for policy (Source Schade et al. 2017)
Perspective to Digital Earth (Annoni et al. 2011), the Digital Earth Nervous System
(De Longueville et al. 2010), the Digital Earth Living Lab—DELI (Schade and
Granell 2014) and views beyond the next-generation Digital Earth (Ehlers et al.
2014), a clear direction of Digital Earth and related research concentrates on the
possible contributions of and interrelationships with citizens—and citizen science is
a very promising way to progress in this direction on local and global levels.
Digital Earth can be seen as an enabler of citizen science. With its enabling
geospatial information infrastructures (see also Chap. 5) and Digital Earth platforms
(see also Chap. 2), it offers citizen scientists a rich set of content and functionalities
that can help develop and prepare citizen science initiatives. For example, technical
solutions, recommendations and training material for geospatial data management
could be offered by parts of the Digital Earth community (Chap. 5). Digital Earth
technology can provide mapping tools and others forms of visualization, and can help
any group of people explore, analyze, and model data collected by citizen scientists
in combination with data from other sources. It can also provide access to machine
learning algorithms and other forms of artiﬁcial intelligence (see also Chap. 10)
that can help in quality control and quality assurance of citizen science data. With
this capacity, Digital Earth technology can help address the continuing challenge of
data processing scalability. With the potentially very high volume of citizen science
data, it is impossible to rely on skilled community members and scientists alone to
meet the need for quality-assured results. In addition, Digital Earth capabilities can
help communicate core messages underpinned by research results. The story map of
612
M. A. Brovelli et al.
the European Year of Cultural Heritage is one example of many (Cultural Heritage
2018).
Digital Earth and Digital Earth research are also a beneﬁciary of citizen science.
Citizen scientists can provide valuable input on priority items for research agendas
and in terms of data provisioning, for example, from mobile apps or lower-cost sen-
sors systems. Citizen scientists can also provide valuable contributions to ﬁeld vali-
dation (e.g., to validate land use types that have been extracted from satellite imagery)
or training of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms (e.g., by crowdsourced applications
that combine human reasoning with machine learning to extract damaged buildings
in remotely sensed images). Concrete cases can be found on the GEO-Wiki platform
(Geo-Wiki 2018).
The above examples only scratch the surface of the possibilities to advance Digi-
tal Earth research. Projecting these capabilities into the not too distant future, it can
be imagined that new technologies will enable citizens to contribute to individual
data and to our reasoning capabilities and interpretations via a global Digital Earth
infrastructure for dedicated use. Possible uses might include new scientiﬁc discov-
eries in the earth and environmental sciences or in areas such as astronomy, social
science and economics. Whereas most cases of citizen science apply to the former
ﬁelds, possible applications might address more holistic approaches to overcoming
challenges including energy, food and water. It has been illustrated that citizen sci-
ence can contribute to all of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
(European Commission, Directorate-General for Environment et al. 2018).
In exploring these new possibilities of citizen science within the context of Digital
Earth, it cannot be forgotten that the indicated approaches must adhere to ethical and
legal considerations. Whenoperatingonaglobal scale, thevalues andstandards of the
communities involved vary largely, as well as the cultures and habits of participants.
Any realistic future scenario should adhere to local circumstances and deﬁne the
possible contributions to (geographically) larger scale initiatives. The example of
Let’s do it World (Let’s do it 2018) underlines some of the difﬁculties and Global
Mosquito Alert (European Citizen Science Association 2018) conﬁrms and, to some
extent, complements these issues. Both initiatives aim at data collection and actions
around our planet. However, they also allow for diversities, for example, in the data
collection approach and additional community activities. By doing so, they provide
a global framework and initiate movements while remaining open to the emerging
(unpredictable) dynamics of those that react to the call for action. This openness
and readiness to adapt to and accommodate speciﬁc needs is a key success criterion
when dealing with local communities and stakeholder groups, and becomes even
more important when the activity is spread across the globe.

18.5
Forms of Citizen Engagement and Distribution
of Participation
Citizen science can be considered one form of citizen engagement, which is a broader
concept encompassing other practices such as civic engagement, public participation
and do-it-yourself (DIY) science (Figueiredo Nascimento et al. 2016). These prac-
tices involve different forms of contributions from citizens and collaboration with
actors other than the academic community. A common feature of citizen science
is the collaboration between the public and professional scientists in civic engage-
ment rather than collaboration with academics, and the primary aim is to develop
the knowledge, skills and values that can make a difference in the civic life of com-
munities (Ehrlich 2000). DIY Science (Figueiredo Nascimento et al. 2014) includes
nonspecialists, hobbyists and amateurs who do research outside institutional research
centers in settings such as Makerspaces, FabLabs, and Hackerspaces, where people
meet and work together to develop new projects and devices (Figueiredo Nascimento
et al. 2016). Technically savvy people can carry out their own DIY science efforts
using low-cost sensors and other devices including easy-to-program control boards,
miniaturized computers (such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi) and 3D printers, and share
information over collaborative websites (Haklay et al. 2018a, b).
Regardless of the differences in contributions, actors, and settings, these forms
of citizen engagement provide opportunities for citizens to engage in science and
innovation and, more generally, in the challenges that affect our society (Figueiredo
Nascimento et al. 2016). As argued by previous authors, better use and integration of
the inputs from citizens can expand the evidence used for policy-making and science,
turning citizens into generators of innovation (Figueiredo Nascimento et al. 2016).
18.5.1
The “Power Law” Distribution of Participation
Digital technologies such as smartphones and tablets enable many people to engage
but participation in online communities plots along a solid core/periphery model—
provided that social software supports both low threshold participation and high
engagement. Although the number of citizen science initiatives has grown, many
projects fail to attract and retain enough participants. Participants tend to engage
with projects for short periods of time, and successful projects rely on a small num-
ber of contributors who do most of the work (Dickinson and Bonney 2012; Curtis
2014; Sauermann and Franzoni 2015). For example, in GalaxyZoo, a very successful
crowdsourced astronomy project, Lintott et al. (2008) show that a small number of
participants complete a high number of classiﬁcations and that there is a tendency
of participant withdrawal over time (Fig. 18.8). In their study of individual-level
activity in seven different citizen science projects, Franzoni and Sauermann (2014)
found that most participants contributed only once and with little effort, and the top
10% of contributors were responsible for almost 80% of classiﬁcations. This pattern
614
M. A. Brovelli et al.
Fig. 18.8 The distribution of
classiﬁcations among users.
A small number completed
more than 100,000
classiﬁcations each and the
peak of the distribution is at
approximately 30
classiﬁcations per user
(Source Lintott et al. 2008)
of participation is known as a ‘power law’ distribution, or the ‘Pareto Principle’, and
has been observed in several online communities such as Wikipedia, where most con-
tent is generated by a minority of users. Therefore, this phenomenon is not speciﬁc
to citizen science projects. Franzoni and Sauermann note that the reasons for this
uneven distribution of contributions are unclear. In their opinion, one reason could
be that, as soon as the volunteers start contributing to the project, they realize that the
match does not ﬁt their expectation or is not suitable for their skills. One can argue
that the speciﬁc demographics in citizen science may inﬂuence this distribution of
participation.
18.5.2
Citizen Scientists Are a Minority and Have Speciﬁc
Demographics
Digitaltechnologiesenablemassparticipationandincreasethepotentialforconsider-
able diversity among citizens in terms of age, gender, experience, race, and education,
but participation in most citizen science projects is biased towards white men aged
20–65 from well-to-do socioeconomic backgrounds (Haklay 2015). For example, a
study found that 87% of participants in a volunteer computing project were men,
and a similar bias was identiﬁed in ecological observations of birds (Krebs 2010).
A report by the Stockholm Environment Institute for the UK Government (DEFRA
2015) showed that the percentage of the UK population that had participated in envi-
ronmental volunteering was biased towards white, male, middle-aged, higher income
people. Low-income people, those with disabilities, and those of black and minority
18
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth
615
ethnic origin are traditionally underrepresented in citizen science, for example, in
environmental volunteering (Ockenden 2007). Identity-based communities such as
YouthMappers and GeoChicas can achieve higher inclusion rates among speciﬁc
demographics but may not achieve other goals such as racial and ethnic or economic
diversity.
At the international level, citizen science is concentrated in advanced economies,
especially the US and northern Europe. Access to connectivity represents a barrier
to wider participation, with a level of access of 87% in the UK, 81% in the US,
and 65% in European countries such as Poland and Portugal (Haklay 2015). Haklay
noted that many software applications developed for citizen science projects require
continuous connectivity, but 3G and 4G coverage is partial even in highly urbanized
environments such as London or New York City and less in remote nature reserves.
Another barrier to broad participation is language. English is the main language
in science, and many tools and technologies that support citizen science projects
presuppose knowledge of English and are not available in local languages (Haklay
2015).
18.5.3
Not Only Science: Citizen Science for Digital Social
Innovation and the Role of Local Authorities
and Governments
It can be argued that citizen science should extend beyond the framing of citizen
engagement in scientiﬁc research. The European Commission stated this need in
relation to responsible research and innovation (RRI), which is an element of the EU
Horizon 2020 program. RRI calls for researchers, companies, NGOs, and members
of the public to collaborate during the research and innovation process to align both
the process and its outcomes with the values, needs, and expectations of the European
society (European Commission 2018). This view reﬂects the aspiration to cocreate
the future with citizens and include diverse stakeholders to address social challenges.
Digital technologies such as social media and online platforms, open data, and
open and standardized APIs have led to opportunities for different modes of citizen
engagement and new forms of interaction among different stakeholders. Therefore,
digitaltechnologiesandtheInternethavethepotentialtoenableformsofdigitalsocial
innovation, that is, social and collaborative innovations in which different actors use
these technologies to cocreate knowledge and solutions for issues of social concern
(Bria 2015). In a study commissioned by the European Commission, Bria illustrated
examples of digital social innovation involving citizen science, including the Globe
at Night project in which citizens used a camera and geo-tagging functions on their
smartphones to help the research project measure global levels of light pollution,
effectively coupling open data and citizen science.
The growth of data generated by citizens can beneﬁt scientists as well as other
social actors. For example, the public sector could use data volunteered by citizens
616
M. A. Brovelli et al.
to address critical socioeconomic and environmental issues and inform policies. Two
projects are worth mentioning: CuriousNoses (Curieuze Neuzen 2018), a citizen sci-
ence project in which 20,000 citizens measured the air quality near their homes in
Antwerp, Belgium in May 2018, and the Decentralised Network for Odour Sensing,
Empowerment and Sustainability (D-Noses 2018), a large project in which citizens
in 7 European and 3 non-European countries use innovative mapping tools to detect
odor issues and cocreate speciﬁc solutions with several stakeholders including local
authorities. Local authorities and governments can play a leading role in champi-
oning citizen science and social innovation projects. As noted by the Earthwatch
Institute (n.d.), local authorities can champion citizen science to raise awareness
of the surrounding environment and support environmental protection and education
programs. Furthermore, local authorities and governments can enlist citizen scientists
to participate in efforts to study social problems and cocreate actionable solutions.
To this end, open data platforms can provide powerful tools for sharing information
and developing collaborations to apply knowledge in the real world.
18.6
Conclusions
The rapid and profound nature of the technological innovations related to Digital
Earth resources are matched, and even outpaced, by the social innovations unfolding
in relation to creating and using them for citizen science. These dynamic conﬁgu-
rations bring together new arrays of actors and diverse communities of interest to
contribute to and apply the data and knowledge in ways that are only made possible
by the massive participation of individuals and institutions.
In this chapter, we deliberately took a positive stance towards citizen science but
some important operational challenges should not be overlooked. In the previous
section, we addressed one of challenge, which is the difﬁculty of attracting and
retaining a diverse base of contributors. Another main issue faced by citizen science
is ensuring quality, especially the intrinsic quality of data, that is, the accuracy and
believability of data provided by citizens (Prestopnik et al. 2014). Quality concerns
are a large barrier to wider use of citizen science approaches by professional scientists
and policy makers and the diffusion of citizen science project ﬁndings (Burgess et al.
2017; West and Pateman 2017). The reasons for this concern include participants’
lack of formal scientiﬁc training and limited scientiﬁc knowledge, uneven levels of
expertise and anonymity, as well as nonstandardized and poorly designed methods
of data collection (Hunter et al. 2012). Research ﬁndings and data are sometimes not
published because the ownership and property rights were not clariﬁed during project
initiation, leading to disagreements or misunderstandings among diverse participants
withdifferentnormsandinterests(Guerrinietal.2018;Resniketal.2015).Therefore,
it is important to understand how citizen scientists produce data, how accurate these
data can be, and the factors that inﬂuence data quality. The literature suggests a
number of approaches that can help projects ensure high-quality processes and results
(Wiggins et al. 2011). Among others, reviews by experts can help establish scientiﬁc
18

617
standards, and training of new participants can improve the consistency of research
processes and results.
Despite these challenges, the current state of progress is encouraging given the
results of humanitarian, environmental, and economic efforts but it has not fully
overcome complex challenges related to quality, equity, inclusion, and governance.
Outcomes unfolding in present contexts will determine the future extent to which
Digital Earth created with and for citizen science is accountable to the needs of the
planet and its inhabitants.

The Economic Value of Digital Earth
Max Craglia and Katarzyna Pogorzelska
Abstract In this chapter, we approach the economic value of Digital Earth with a
broad deﬁnition of economic value, i.e., the measure of beneﬁts from goods or ser-
vices to an economic agent and the trade-offs the agent makes in view of scarce
resources. The concept of Digital Earth has several components: data, models,
technology and infrastructure. We focus on Earth Observation (EO) data because
this component has been undergoing the most dramatic change since the begin-
ning of this century. We review the available recent studies to assess the value of
EO/geospatial/open data and related infrastructures and identify three main sets of
approaches focusing on the value of information, the economic approach to the value
of EO to the economy from both macro- and microeconomic perspectives, and a third
set that aims to maximize value through infrastructure and policy. We conclude that
the economic value of Digital Earth critically depends on the perspective: the value
for whom, what purpose, and when. This multiplicity is not a bad thing: it acknowl-
edges that Digital Earth is a global concept in which everyone can recognize their
viewpoint and collaborate with others to increase the common good.

Introduction: Framing the Issue
Previous chapters of this manual introduced the concept and deﬁnitions of Digital
Earth (Chap. 1) and the data and technologies that contribute to it (Chaps. 2–12) and
focused on the role of Digital Earth in supporting the achievement of sustainable
development, particularly the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Chap. 13) linked
to climate change (Chap. 14) and disaster risk reduction (Chap. 15). Each of these
areas has bothsocial valuetopresent andfuturegenerations (BrundtlandCommission

1987) and economic value, i.e., the measure of beneﬁts from goods or services
to an economic agent (person, company or organization involved in an economic
transaction) and the trade-offs the agent makes in view of scarce resources.1 Given
that each area of application of Digital Earth has both economic and social value
and, by deﬁnition, this value varies according to different economic agents (the key
question: value for whom?), how can we approach the economic value of Digital
Earth?
Previous studies have dealt with the economics of issues linked to sustainable
development. For example, Pezzey and Tonan (2017) addressed the economics of
sustainability, Anand and Sen (2000) addressed human development and economic
sustainability, the review by Stern analyzed the economics of climate change (Stern
2007), and Shreve and Kelman (2014) among others, reviewed the cost-beneﬁt anal-
yses of disaster risk reduction. As far as the value of Digital Earth is concerned, a
review of the literature is not much help. A query on “the economic value of digital
earth” on Google Scholar returns no entries, and a search on the web returns only the
table of contents of this manual. A more fruitful approach may be to deconstruct Digi-
tal Earth into its constituent components. As indicated in Chap. 1, Digital Earth can be
viewed from multiple perspectives; some emphasize the conceptual/representation
aspects of Digital Earth (Gore 1999; Goodchild et al. 2012) and the data/information
component (Goodchild 2013), others emphasize the information system component
(Guo et al. 2009; Guo 2012; Grossner et al. 2008), and others emphasize the multi-
disciplinary body of knowledge and theoretical component (Goodchild et al. 2012;
Guo et al. 2009). Each of these perspectives could be the subject of an economic
analysis, but the one that has received greatest attention of late is data, described
as the “new oil or the most valuable resource” of the digital economy (Economist
2017).
The rise of big data has recently been outpacing the growth in computer processing
power and is set to speed up even further with the advent of the Internet of Things and
billions of devices connected to the internet via 5G networks. For example, between
2002 and 2009, data trafﬁc grew 56-fold, compared with a corresponding 16-fold
increase in computing power (largely tracking Moore’s law), as shown in Fig. 19.1
(Short et al. 2011; Kambatla et al. 2014).
The evolution of Digital Earth as a result of big (Earth) data, the Internet of Things,
social media and new participatory approaches in which people contribute to sensing
the environment were partially foreseen by Goodchild et al. (2012) and Craglia et al.
(2012). What we did not expect was that the convergence of data and computing
availability would lead to a major change in the development and use of artiﬁcial
intelligence (largely since 2012) (Craglia et al. 2018) and that Earth observation
would become such a big business for private sector companies and investors. Data
seem to be the more signiﬁcant change factor of the last decade, and therefore, this
chapter focuses on reviewing the recently adopted approaches to assess the value of
EO data, building on a study carried out at the Joint Research Centre by Pogorzelska
(2018), as a lens through which to see the value of Digital Earth.

This chapter is organized as follows. After the Introduction, Sect. 19.2 outlines
different viewpoints on the value of EO, Sect. 19.3 reviews approaches and method-
ologies to assess the value of EO, and Sect. 19.4 draws conclusions that are relevant
to Digital Earth.
19.2
Different Viewpoints on the Value of Earth
Observation
19.2.1
Deﬁnition of EO
Inthis chapter, weadopt thedeﬁnitionof Earthobservationas developedbytheGroup
on Earth Observations (GEO). EO is understood as “the gathering of information
about planet Earth’s physical, chemical and biological systems”2 through a range of
technological means such as satellites, aircrafts and drones, in situ measurements or
ground-based monitoring stations. Remote sensing (RS) is a technique used in EO
to observe objects from a distance without being in direct contact with them.
Various studies deal with EO as part of broader “geospatial data” or “spatial
data”. The adjectives “geospatial” and “spatial” are usually used interchangeably.
The term “spatial data” is legally recognized in Europe as deﬁned in the INSPIRE
directive (European Commission 2007) and means “any data with a direct or indirect
reference to a speciﬁc location or geographical area” (ibid, Art 3). Spatial data,
2GEO: https://www.earthobservations.org/g_faq.html. Accessed 7 Apr 2019.
626
M. Craglia and K. Pogorzelska
apart from EO, encompasses data from other technology segments such as the global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) and positioning, geographic information systems
(GIS)/spatial analytics, and 3D scanning.3 Since all of the above are relevant for
Digital Earth, we use the GEO deﬁnition and therefore use EO as a broad label that
also covers (geo)spatial data.
19.2.2
Value for Whom?
The value of data and information varies according to who values it and for what
purpose, and often also carries a time dimension, i.e., some data may very valuable
now (e.g., stock market prices or agricultural yield data) but almost worthless in a
few hours (Blakemore and Craglia 2006).
The socioeconomic value of EO data is often greater when combined with other
data. The value for a user of a digital map is greater when one can also navigate to a
chosen destination as a result of combining EO data with location data. The value can
be greater still if EO is combined with the social data of other participants in trafﬁc
because predictions of the trafﬁc ﬂow can be made and alternative routes can be
proposed (to measure the value of a digital map, see, for example, Alpha Beta 2017).
The value of EO data is easier to appreciate from the perspective of an individual in
the mass market because of the daily use of EO–based solutions; assessment of the
value of EO from the perspectives of the public and private sectors is more complex.
19.2.2.1
Public Sector Perspective
Governments have traditionally been the main users of various forms of geographic
information, such as maps, for taxation, way-ﬁnding, navigation, and defense. With
the expansion of commercial aviation and the launch of civilian space programs in
the twentieth century, the public sector, often in partnership with the private sector
or through private sector contractors, continued to remain the main producer and
user of EO, largely for scientiﬁc purposes, weather monitoring and forecasting, and
to support policy in the environmental, societal and economic domains. The public
sector greatly relies on EO data—often combined with social and economic data—to
help inform policies directed towards a range of environmental and socioeconomic
objectives. The environmental policy objectives that rely on EO information revolve
around the management of natural resources and battling environmental threats such
as land, air and water pollution, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change.4
The EO-supported social policies touch on citizens’ wellbeing and include areas such
as security and defense, science, education, agriculture, safety and rescue, disaster

and disease response, health, transport and urban planning. Economic objectives
include the development of innovations, knowledge and solutions that can increase
competitiveness and create new products, services, and prosperity. In Europe, there
has been a noticeable shift in EO policy to add objectives aimed at developing the
digital single market and harnessing opportunities for economic growth and jobs in
the private sector.
From the standpoint of the public sector, the value of EO mostly lies in informing
policy making and decision making. EO can inform the full policy cycle: it helps iden-
tify needs and areas for policy intervention, formulate policies, and tailor regulatory
responses that can use legal tools that rely on EO to support policy implementation
and decision making. EO also supports policy monitoring and policy change.
There are numerous examples of how EO supports policy making. To identify
policy intervention areas, satellite imagery allows for realizing the scale and rate of
deforestation, for example, in the Amazon rainforest, which eventually led to passage
of a regulation that resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the pace of deforestation (see,
for example, Finer et al. 2018).
As far as lawmaking is considered, the most visible use of EO is as a regulatory
compliance tool (Purdy 2010), especially in enforcement of environmental legisla-
tion. There are at least three forms of the use of EO as a regulatory compliance tool:
(a) as part of a targeted enforcement strategy to monitor speciﬁc laws, (b) in moni-
toring of individual sites or areas where environmental offenses have occurred, such
as marine pollution (Wahl et al. 1996), and (c) as a form of historical evidence. There
is a form of targeted regulatory monitoring, for example, in the agriculture sector in
the EU, where legislation gives Member States the option of using data from “un-
manned aircraft systems, geo-tagged photographs, GNSS-receivers combined with
EGNOS and Galileo, data captured by the Copernicus Sentinels satellites and oth-
ers” to monitor farm subsidy payments under agricultural cross-compliance schemes
(European Commission 2018). The introduction of EO to replace or supplement on-
ﬁeld checks is aimed at reducing both the administrative burden on the EU member
states and the cost of monitoring farm subsidies for potential fraud. For example,
Australia incorporated satellite surveillance of tree clearing in the policy strategies
of relevant legislation (Purdy 2010). EO data have also been increasingly used as
evidence. Systematic archiving of satellite images provides regulators or a court with
a relatively impartial snapshot of any location at any given time, providing accurate
evidence that would often be otherwise unavailable. Such satellite imagery has been
used as evidence in lawsuits. In the 2012 UK pollution case, satellite images were
used as primary evidence to prove the breach of UK maritime pollution legislation
by Maersk Tankers Singapore; in another case in the US, imagery was used to show
false insurance claims (Rocchio 2006).
Regarding policy implementation, public institutions use EO for their decision
making. Large ﬁnancial institutions such as the World Bank or the Asian Develop-
ment Bank often tailor their ofﬁcial development assistance (ODA) in accordance
with EO-based environmental information.5 Another example of the use of EO data

M. Craglia and K. Pogorzelska
is the US federal decision making for drought disaster assistance, which heavily
depends on drought indicators fed by EO data (Steinemann et al. 2015). Finally, EO
supports the statistics necessary to monitor progress towards policy objectives (see
UN 2017) and helps evaluate the outcomes and necessary changes to policies (see
BRYCE 2017).
The last decade saw a huge increase in the number of EO satellites, including
privately funded ones; combined with advancements in ICT, EO satellites changed
the way that public institutions can use EO data and information. Due to the satellite-
based infrastructure, EO data now provide insights into nearly real time geograph-
ical distributions of various phenomena that are commensurable across countries,
regions and cities, allowing for timely and targeted responses to various needs or
threats. Open and free access to data and analytical tools, advances in algorithms
and data processing have started to enable the widespread use of this information.
Harmonized and interoperable EO data infrastructures are often combined with other
geo-referenced sociodemographic, economic and public administration data to make
the indicators and analysis more robust and international reports more harmonized
(OECD 2017). This eventually equips public institutions with tools that allow for
better cooperation, particularly in face of challenges of a global scale. In this respect,
the global cooperation achieved through the Group on Earth Observations (GEO)6
is also important.
19.2.2.2
Private Sector Perspective
Whereas the EO upstream and end-user segments used to be signiﬁcantly dominated
by the governmental institutions, the private sector has been traditionally more pro-
nounced in the EO downstream segment concerned with the creation of added-value
products and services. Because the existing EO market was mostly driven by the
demand from the public sector, particularly from the defense and security segments
(ca. 60%, see Keith 2016), in 2014 there was still no functioning EO market (Smart
2014). The last few years witnessed the staggering growth of the EO market (Euro-
pean Commission 2017) in both the amount of money ﬂowing to the EO sector
economy and the number of new players at all levels of the EO value chain. These
are good indicators of the advancement of the EO market towards maturity.
To large extent, the fast maturing of the EO market has been enabled and driven
by technology developments in both the upstream and downstream EO segments.
The miniaturization of satellites and the reusability of rockets were upstream-related
technology developments, and increased analytical capabilities coupled with the
enhanced ICT infrastructure reshaped the EO sector from the bottom. The former
developments allowed for democratization of the access to space and vertical inte-
gration across different sectors; and the latter created a signiﬁcant thirst for data
outside the public sector and demand from the individual mass markets (e.g., digital
imagery). These developments heavily impacted the dynamic in the whole EO sector.

The Economic Value of Digital Earth
629
They facilitated different forms of collaboration between the public and private
sectors. Currently, innovative companies and businesses more actively contribute
to the socioeconomic policymaking by proposing solutions based on the innovative
technologicaldevelopments(fortheissueofbuildingpartnershipbetweenthesectors,
see EARSC 2014).
Technology developments also enabled different business models and contributed
to the growth of the individual mass market. The space industry has developed into
a multibillion-dollar industry with global revenues increasing from $175 billion in
2005 to almost $385 billion in 2017—a growth rate of approximately 7% per year
(US Chamber of Commerce 2019). According to Morgan Stanley (2018), the global
space industry could generate a revenue of $1.1 trillion or more in 2040, with almost
50% of projected growth coming from satellite broadband internet access. While
the demand for data has been growing at an exponential rate, particularly with the
increasing demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of Things,
artiﬁcial intelligence, virtual reality, and video, the cost of access to space (and, by
extension, data) is falling rapidly. With the development of reusable rockets, the cost
to launch a satellite has decreased from approximately $200 million to approximately
$60million,withapotentialdroptoaslowas$5million,accordingtoMorganStanley
(2018). The mass production of pico satellites such as CubeSat has brought costs
down from hundreds of millions to several thousand dollars,7 so that companies such
as Planet can afford to send dozens of satellites in space every launch and operate a
constellation of over 150 satellites orbiting the Earth. This is creating entirely new
markets as an increasing number of companies offer daily high-resolution images of
the Earth to monitor change. It also creates opportunities for companies providing
launch and ground-segment facilities. In November 2018, Amazon Web Services
announced the deployment of their ﬁrst ground stations, with an aim of having 12
operational by mid-2019 and expanding their business to pay-as-you-go EO (Barr
2018). This announcement is potentially a big step in the expanding market for EO
given the market size and reach of AWS.
The amount of private sector capital in the space sector is staggering, considering
that this industry was dominated by large government-backed national space agencies
until recently. According to Seraphim Capital, a venture capital fund, the amount of
VC in the space sector was $3.25 billion in 2018, up 30% from 2017, with over 180
companies receiving backing, an increase of over 40% compared with the previous
year. The launching sector received the highest investment ﬂow of just over $1 billion
in 2018 and data collection platforms (satellite constellations and drones) followed
closely behind at $868 million.8 Notably, China is also becoming a big player in
the commercial space market since the government opened the country to private

to rival the American (GPS) and European (Galileo) satellite navigation systems.9
While the development of the space industry is making the headlines, there are
many other areas in which private sector companies are investing in geospatial data
capture, processing, and value-adding, which are relevant to the further development
of Digital Earth. Examples include well-established companies such as Trimble,
which traditionally serviced the surveying and construction industry, and has now
expanded into mining and precision agriculture; DigitalGlobe, which has moved
from being a data supplier to a solution provider for speciﬁc sectors such as the
automotive industry10; and new companies such as NextNav, which specializes in
indoor positioning systems with a dedicated infrastructure of indoor antennae for
applications including geo-advertising, public safety, and emergency services.
The increasing availability of EO with integrated multiple sensors from both
space and the ground together with processing power and storage at diminishing
costs, business models based on pay-as-you-go for everything-as-a-service and the
development of AI algorithms to process the data and extract meaningful information
are opening EO to a much wider audience of companies that are not experts in EO
or geo-processing. A good example is Orbital Insight, a start-up established in 2013
that combines detailed imagery provided by companies such as Planet with public
sector data and develops AI algorithms to provide solutions for speciﬁc sectors such
as energy and advanced consumer intelligence.11
The above mentioned technology developments can also be linked to the creation
ofthedistinguishedramiﬁcationoftheEOmarket,namely,theEOdatamarket,which
does not quite ﬁt the traditional upstream or downstream EO segments but rather
conveniently nests in between, being pulled by the gravity of the big data market.
The commercial EO data market was estimated at EUR 1.5 billion in 2015 with the
opportunity to grow to EUR 2.6 billion in 2025 (European Commission 2017). While
upstream companies naturally expanded into this market segment and beneﬁt from
selling VHR EO or data products, the new inﬂux from outside the EO sector is a
relatively new phenomenon. The big IT techs such as Google or Facebook introduced
new business models to the EO domain. They do not seek proﬁts from selling EO
data or EO-based services or products but proﬁt from business intelligence based
on combining EO big data with different streams of other data, especially location
and social data. In such cases, IT platforms play the role of a content aggregator that
can satisfy different customer needs while making proﬁts from targeted advertising
based on big data-based business intelligence. The recent developments by Amazon
and Google are in this direction.
While the market is changing so rapidly, assessing the value of EO from both
economic and social perspectives is not easy. In the next section, we review some

Review of Approaches and Methodologies to Assess
the Value of EO
AssessingthevalueofEOhasbeenthesubjectofresearchforseveralyearsworldwide
(Borzacchiello and Craglia 2011). The interdisciplinary and cross-cutting nature of
the use of EO data resulted in a wide range of approaches to identify and measure the
value of EO. A review of recent studies on the subject by Pogorzelska (2018) iden-
tiﬁed three main clusters of approaches. The ﬁrst focuses on capturing economic
value of EO and gathers micro- and macroeconomic methodologies. The second
enters the discussion on EO value through the more interdisciplinary conceptual
framework of the value of information (VOI). Since EO exhibits characteristics of
an all-purpose infrastructure good, many have noted that measuring the value of EO
in a comprehensive and exhaustive way is impossible; therefore, some approaches
primarily focus on ways to maximize its value. The third cluster gathers method-
ologies concerned with maximization of the value of EO through enhancement of
the data infrastructure and open access to EO data. These clusters are by no means
exhaustive or exclusive. They represent different perspectives or entry points to the
discussion and are often combined within one study. The methodologies used within
one cluster may be used along with others or adapted to serve a speciﬁc purpose
(e.g., VOI studies adapt micro- and macroeconomic methodologies to reﬂect value
of EO-based information).
19.3.1
Value of Information (VOI) Approach
The studies framed by the value of information generally examine how EO-based
information can be tied to decision making, how those decisions can be linked to
societal outcomes, and how those societal outcomes produce value.
VOI studies underline that the value of information is tightly linked to its use.
Barr and Masser (1997) claim that “information has no inherent value, it is only of
value once used and that value is related to the nature of the use rather than the nature
of the information [thus] information has very different values for different users.”
EO-derived information is valuable when it informs decisions aimed at achieving
various environmental, social and economic beneﬁts.
Since the value of EO-derived information changes depending on the speciﬁc
use and the user, VOI studies also deal with different value propositions. Macauley
(2005) proposed a framework to provide a common basis to evaluate information
dependingonthetypeofuser.Macauley(2006)alsoprovidedatheoreticalfoundation
632
M. Craglia and K. Pogorzelska
for establishing the value of space-derived information and a framework that uses
economic principles.
As far as the subsequent quantiﬁcation of this value is considered, the VOI
approach gathers a very diverse set of methodologies. There have been ongoing
efforts in the ﬁelds of GIS and related systems as well as remote sensing to acceler-
ate the development of methodologies to quantify the beneﬁts arising from EO-based
decisions. Meta reviews of the literature in this ﬁeld have been carried out, for exam-
ple, by Lance et al. (2006), Genovese et al. (2009), Richter et al. (2010). GEO-related
work and research focused on remote sensing have been carried out, for example, by
Fritz et al. (2008) and Rydzak et al. (2010).
While there is a widely recognized need for EO value to denote a quantitative
measure, many agree that it does not need to be expressed in monetary terms (Borza-
cchiello and Craglia 2011). The VOI economists usually seek to monetize the differ-
ence between decisions made with and without the EO-derived information (Gallo
et al. 2018). However, the beneﬁts are often expressed in nonmonetary terms such as
in reductions in mortality and morbidity, reduced damage to capital assets, improved
community well-being, time saved, fuel saved, reduced carbon emissions and many
other social and economic measurements (Kruse et al. 2018). Studies have identiﬁed
a set of methodologies used to quantify the value of EO-derived information, e.g.,
McCallum et al. (2010), Borzacchiello and Craglia (2011), Slotin (2018). The range
of the methodologies identiﬁed includes the following:
• Value-measuring methodology (VMM) was developed to calculate the return on
investment (ROI) relating to decisions based on intangible values.12 It was adapted
by the International Institute for Applied System Analysis (IASA) to assess the
beneﬁts of the EuroGEOSS;
• Impact-based methodology—this methodology determines value by qualitatively
assessing the causal effect of information availability on economic and social
outcomes, or the costs in terms of inefﬁciencies or poor policy decisions due to
limited or poor-quality information;
• Systems dynamics modeling—like the methodology above, it measures the impact
of EO-derived information. The value of EO is described through system dynamics
models, where a change in one variable (e.g., EO-based information affects other
variables over time, for example, the FeliX model13);
• Bayesian belief network—this conventional statistical approach assumes that peo-
ple’s expectations are updated when new information is available (for use of the
methodology, see, for example, Bouma et al. 2009);
• Regulatory cost-effectiveness—this methodology assesses the direct cost savings
achieved when a regulatory framework is in place;
• Willingness-to-pay methodology—this methodology concentrates on monetiza-
tion of beneﬁts through surveys of individuals and private and public institutions
12The VMM was initially developed by the Federal Chief Information Ofﬁcers Council (2002) and
applied in a case study by Hamilton (2005).

that estimate their willingness to pay or the amount they are willing to accept for
not having the data/information; and
• Case-based monetization of beneﬁts—this method focuses on measuring (often
monetizing) the beneﬁts resulting from a speciﬁc EO-supported decision, solution,
product or service. The approach usually relies on qualitative analysis to identify
and measure the beneﬁts that arise.
19.3.2
Economic Approaches
This cluster of approaches gathers macro- and microeconomic methodologies to
capture the economic value arising in the context of EO. This set of methodologies
has clearly become more relevant as the EO market has matured.
Macroeconomic
This group of approaches enters the discussion on the value of EO from the perspec-
tive of the economic impact of the EO sector on the economy and links the value of
EO to the macroeconomic statistics characterizing the sector. The macroeconomic
methodologies include the following:
• GDP impact assessment—this approach focuses on calculating the return on pub-
lic investment in the EO sector. The following indicators are usually taken into
account: investment of the upstream sector, spending by suppliers, wages/salaries
of employees, employment impact, government tax revenues (income direct tax,
VAT, employer social security contributions, employee social security contribu-
tions; see, for example, Strategy 2015);
• Economic impact assessment—focuses on the use of speciﬁc economic tools to
assess impact, such as input-output tables and computable general equilibrium
models (CGEM); and
• EO value chain approaches—these approaches focus on assessment of the value of
EO across a whole value chain. A speciﬁc value chain is identiﬁed and qualitatively
analyzed. The methodology usually relies on quantiﬁcation of the value of EO
as the increase in revenues and reductions in costs related to the EO-supported
activities, compared with a situation where no EO-derived solutions are available
(see, for example, PwC 2016).
Microeconomic
Microeconomic approaches focus on EO market characteristics and market
approaches to value EO data and customer behavior. This cluster includes the fol-
lowing:
• Characterization of the EO market—this approach focuses on EO expressed
through the statistics characterizing the EO market, the EO data market and speciﬁc
markets for EO-based solutions, products and services;
634
M. Craglia and K. Pogorzelska
• Stated/revealed preferences—these methods assess the value of EO-derived
data/information though the amount that users are willing to pay or the amount
they are willing to accept for not having the data/information;
• Market equivalent pricing—this is the market price that should have been received
if the statistical or EO data outputs were sold in a market environment. This
approach approximates market prices by looking at the market prices of similar
data products, such as those from companies that offer data for prices, or business
trends drawn from a range of sources including open government data;
• Cost-based derivation—this method determines value based on the full cost of
producing the data, statistics or information; and
• Discounted cash ﬂows (DCF) methodology—this method ascribes a value/price
to a speciﬁc dataset (intrinsic value) based on a projection of its future cash ﬂows
that is discounted to today’s value.
19.3.3
Approaches Concerned with Maximization of EO
Value
This group of approaches recognizes that, although measuring EO value is difﬁcult
and relative, if not impossible, the improvements in the EO data infrastructure and
open access to data are key prerequisites for maximizing the value of EO. This
cluster often uses impact-based methodology to demonstrate how data infrastructure
investments and removal of speciﬁc barriers to access data affect or may affect
people’s lives or the economy. With respect to this approach, Slotin (2018) argues that
“[b]y linking to real-life outcomes, impact-based case studies show how investments
in data systems can translate into meaningful outcomes for people.” Many case
studies show these impacts, including deliberate experiments such as randomized
control trials and retrospective assessments of impact14 (Slotin 2018).
19.3.3.1
Spatial data infrastructure
Spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) have been (largely) public sector-led investments
by governments across the world to increase the availability and accessibility of
geospatial data for public policy, an informed society, and market development. The
development of SDIs has been documented by many studies, including by Masser
(1999, 2005), Williamson et al. (2003), Crompvoets et al. (2008). For many years,
the global community of researchers and practitioners of SDIs gathered through the
Global SDI association,15 which was formed in 2004 and dissolved in 2018. Now,
global discussions on SDIs are held in many groups, including the International
14See, for example, www.dataimpacts.org.

635
Society for Digital Earth,16 the UN Committee on Global Geospatial Information
Management17 and the Group on Earth Observations, to coordinate efforts to develop
a global Earth observation system of systems (GEOSS).18
In Europe, the adoption of the INSPIRE directive in 2007 (European Commission
2007) provided a major impetus towards the assessment of spatial data infrastruc-
tures and their socioeconomic impacts. A study on the expected economic impact
of INSPIRE was carried out in 2003–2004 prior to adoption of the law (Inspire
and Craglia 2003; Dufourmont et al. 2004). Progress in over 30 European countries
on the implementation of SDIs was reported in a set of studies by Vandenbroucke
and Janssen (2008). Crompvoets et al. (2008) collected a range of theoretical per-
spectives informing the work on SDIs and focused on the improvement of SDIs.
Vandenbroucke et al. (2009) proposed the application of a network perspective to
SDIs. The increased availability and quality of data and data sources are believed to
help inform the actions taken by decision makers and the resulting socioeconomic
beneﬁts (Kruse et al. 2018).
19.3.3.2
Open access to data
Maximization of the value of EO through open access to data is similar to the previous
approach. It primarily differs in the entry point to the discussion. Instead of focusing
on the infrastructure, this approach focuses on the beneﬁts of open access to EO
data as a part of bigger data ecosystem. It considers access to data a key factor in
determining EO-enabled creation of added value and promotes the openness of data.
Approaches that address the value of EO from the perspective of open data often
focus on “unlocking the value of open data” via removal of speciﬁc barriers to data,
not on measuring the actual value of EO. A study by McKinsey (2013) found that
open data can help unlock 3.2 trillion to 5.4 trillion USD in economic value per
year across seven chosen domains: education, transportation, consumer products,
electricity, oil and gas, healthcare, and consumer ﬁnance.
From the economic perspective, the term “open data” falls back on the economic
notion of a “public good”. As a good, EO data are not homogenous. A public good
is a type of good that, once produced for some consumers, can be consumed by
additional consumers at no additional cost.19 The deﬁnition includes the two main
characteristicsofapublicgood,nonrivalryandnonexcludability.“Nonrivalry”means
that the consumption or use of the good does not diminish or remove the availability
of the good to others. “Nonexcludability” means that everyone has access to a good
since no exclusion mechanisms are in place. In contrast to public goods, private goods
are often rivalrous, i.e., the consumption or use of the good diminishes or removes

19For public good theory, see Holcombe (1997). For the theory of public expenditure, see Samuelson
(1954).
636
M. Craglia and K. Pogorzelska
the availability of the good to others, and excludable, i.e., prices, licenses and other
exclusion mechanisms effectively control the number of beneﬁciaries, and property
rights are applied to establish legitimate ownership. If nonpaying users cannot be
excluded from beneﬁts, then the market for the good fails as a result of free-riding
(Harris and Miller 2011; Pearce 1995).
In general, EO data are largely nonrivalrous although some technical measures
may be put in place to limit the number of users and applications. Although non-
rivalrous, EO data tend to vary on the scale of excludability, which resulted in the
heterogeneous landscape of the economic nature of EO data (for a proposition of
mapping economic goods on the two axes of rivalry and excludability, see Harris
and Miller 2011). This variation in excludability is reﬂected in the international legal
provisions relating to access to RS EO data. The Remote Sensing Principles,20 while
promoting widespread access to satellite remote sensing data, contain a provision on
the possibility of “provision of data on reasonable cost terms”.21
The resulting regional and national regulatory frameworks allow for varying
access to EO data. For example, the 2016 US Common Framework for Earth Obser-
vation Data states that “[a] core principle of the U.S. Government is that Federal
Earth-observation data are public goods paid for by the American people and that
free, full and open access to these data signiﬁcantly enhances their value”.22 In the
EU, the Copernicus Regulation provides that Copernicus data shall be made avail-
able on a full, open and free-of-charge basis. This general provision suggests that
Copernicus data are a public good. Nevertheless, lex specialis provides for a series of
possible access limitations that include (a) licensing conditions for third-party data
and information; (b) formats, characteristics and dissemination means; (c) security
interests and external relations of the Union or its Member States; (d) risk of dis-
ruption, for safety or technical reasons, of the system producing Copernicus data
and Copernicus information; and (e) ensuring reliable access to Copernicus data and
Copernicus information for European users.23
Similarly, other EU key regulations on data such as the Public Sector Informa-
tion (PSI) directive (European Commission 2013) or INSPIRE directive (European
Commission 2007) do not guarantee free access to governmental data. They all pro-
mote the idea of open data and encourage public institutions to open the vaults of
their data, resulting in large amounts of data, including EO information, that exhibits
characteristics of a public good (Uhlir and Schroeder 2007; Smith and Doldirina
2016). The opening of the vaults of PSI is often considered a boost for democratic
accountability and for business to create value-added products, foster innovation and
20RS Principles, Principle XII.
21Since the term “reasonable cost” is not deﬁned, Harris and Baumann (2015) suggest that compared
with many other EO data policies, the term should be interpreted as the marginal cost or the cost of
fulﬁlling a user request.

create jobs (Fornefeld et al. 2009; Uhlir 2009). In addition, by alluding to the notion
of public good and accountability, advocates of open data emphasize the need and
legitimacy of science in the policy sphere (Arzberger et al. 2004).
Since increasingly large amounts of EO data exhibit characteristics of a public
good (Smith and Doldirina 2016), the EO market has primarily developed around
the value added to EO data in form of processed EO data or/and information as
well as EO-derived services and products that also integrate other data (for adding
value with the use of open data, see, for example Berends et al. 2017). To add
value to EO data, the high uptake of EO data is critically important. Delponte et al.
(2016) identiﬁed a set of barriers to space market uptake originating in the areas
of policy, governance, technology, skills, and the market itself. To overcome these
barriers, various public initiatives have been put in place. For example, the European
Commission, in cooperation with the ESA, is providing ﬁnancial support to develop
the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS).24 The DIAS are
expectedtobeanaccesspointtoCopernicusdataandtoprovideprocessingresources,
tools and other relevant data to boost user uptake and stimulate innovation and the
creation of new business models based on EO data.

Conclusions
In this chapter, we approached the economic value of Digital Earth with a broad
deﬁnition of economic value, i.e., the measure of beneﬁts from goods or services to
aneconomicagentandthetrade-offstheagentmakesinviewofscarceresources.This
deﬁnition implies that the beneﬁts that can accrue to the economic agent (person,
ﬁrm, or organization) can be more than economic in nature and can encompass
environmental or social beneﬁts.
The complexity of determining the value of Digital Earth is multilayered. A ﬁrst
level of complexity stems from the multiple deﬁnitions of Digital Earth introduced
in Chap. 1: as a concept, an information system, a data organization principle, a
multidisciplinary endeavor, and a science. With such multiple and heterogeneous
perspectives, there is no single value of Digital Earth to measure and there is a whole
range of values depending on the point of view. A second level of complexity is
exposed when deconstructing Digital Earth into its key components: data, models,
technology, and infrastructure. In this chapter, we focused on EO data because it is
undergoing the most dramatic change at the beginning of this century. However, the
value of EO critically depends on the value for whom, for what purpose, and when.

The Economic Value of Digital Earth
639
This maturity is indicated by the level of private investments in the EO market for
all segments, including the launching of satellites, data processing, integration, and
value adding. However, there are no published studies with repeatable methodologies
on the economic return of these large investments.
With this in mind, we reviewed the available recent studies to assess the value of
EO/geospatial/open data and related infrastructures and illustrated that the variety
of purpose and applications requires multiple approaches. We identiﬁed three main
sets of approaches that focus on the value of information, the economic approach to
the value of EO to the economy from both macro- and microeconomic perspectives,
and a third set aiming at maximizing value through infrastructure and policy. Each of
these sets of approaches has something to offer to the understanding and valuation of
Digital Earth. The conclusion that there is no single answer to the question posed at
the beginning of the chapter is not a bad thing: it acknowledges that Digital Earth is a
global concept in which everyone can recognize their viewpoint and collaborate with
others to increase the common good. Ultimately, the true value of Digital Earth may
rest in its values as a metaphor to increase global understanding and communication
across disciplines and between science, policy, and civil society.

Digital Earth in Europe

Abstract In recent years, with the advancements in technology and research as
well as changes in society, Digital Earth transformed. It evolved from its original
concept of a 3D multilayer representation of our planet into a more practical system
design to fulﬁl the demand for information sharing, which now embraces ﬁelds
such as global climate change, food security and natural disaster prevention. In this
novel scenario, Europe has become one of the major players at the global level;
accordingly, the goal of this chapter is to provide a general overview of the major
European contributions to the overall objectives of Digital Earth. These include the
establishment of a European spatial data infrastructure through the Infrastructure for
Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) directive, the initiation of the Galileo and
Copernicus programs that provide a wealth of big data from space, the launch of
novel cloud-based platforms for data processing and integration and the emergence
of citizen science. An outlook on major upcoming initiatives is also provided.

Introduction
The original idea of Digital Earth (DE) ﬁrst introduced by US Vice President Al Gore
in 1998 envisioned a 3D multiresolution representation of our planet embedded with
a variety of geo-referenced data to be transformed into understandable information
(Gore 1999). Two decades ago, the major challenges in achieving such a vision were
related to developing effective solutions for properly displaying, organizing and har-
monizing data in space and time, as well as efﬁciently linking them to each other.
Progress was necessary in the frameworks of Earth observation (EO), computational
science, mass storage capacity and network speed, along with the deﬁnition of ade-
quate metadata standards. At that time, the DE goal seemed difﬁcult to achieve, if

not impossible, but remarkable developments in data collection, hardware and soft-
ware have led to several online web-mapping services (e.g., Google Maps, Microsoft
Bing Maps) and desktop virtual globes (e.g., Google Earth, NASA’s World Wind)
that implement many of the features described by Gore in his speech just 10 years
later, making DE real and accessible to millions of users (Annoni et al. 2011; Craglia
et al. 2012). In this framework, the leading part was played by the United States, with
key contributions from both the public and private sectors. However, with the advent
of big data from space, the emergence of volunteered geographic information—VGI
(e.g., citizen science, crowd-sourcing), the advancements in technology and research,
as well as changes in society, the concept of DE also transformed (Goodchild et al.
2012). DE evolved into a more practical system design to fulﬁl the demand for infor-
mation sharing and overcome the socioeconomic inequality in accessing and using
the data (i.e., the digital divide) (Guo et al. 2016). Moreover, DE expanded its role
in other ﬁelds related to global climate change, urban planning and management,
agriculture and food security, and natural disaster prevention and response. This new
vision will only become reality with effective integration of technologies from EO,
global positioning and geo-information systems, sensor webs, virtual reality, and
grid computing, as well as with proper gathering, harmonizing and sharing of data
(also directly collected by nonexperts) through suitable information infrastructures.
In this new paradigm, the role of Europe has gradually become more prominent,
placing it at the forefront of DE implementation.
Notably, both research and commercial activities falling within the DE concept
have been undertaken in the past 20 years at the single-country level in Europe; never-
theless, it is beyond the scope of this chapter to describe all these speciﬁc initiatives.
Rather, our purpose is to provide a general overview of the major contributions to the
overall objectives of DE from Europe as a whole. In this context, the ﬁrst political
initiatives embedding the DE concept date back to 2010 as part of the Europe 2020
strategy proposed by the European Commission (EC) (EC 2010), i.e., the executive
branch of the European Union (EU), which, to date, is composed of 28 Member
States. Europe 2020 aims to advance the economy in the EU, with a major focus on
research and innovation. Among its 7 ﬂagship initiatives, one has been speciﬁcally
dedicated to the “Digital Agenda” (Annoni et al. 2011). In particular, this aims to
improve the exploitation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to
foster innovation and develop a digital single market for generating smart, sustainable
and inclusive growth in Europe.
In parallel, key European developments have provided major contributions to DE
in the framework of information infrastructure, big data from space, geo-positioning
and citizen science.
Effective data sharing is at the heart of DE and requires suitable and efﬁcient
dedicated information infrastructure, i.e., a framework of policies, standards and
technologies that allow for ﬁnding, accessing, sharing and publishing information.
TheEClaunchedthespatialdatainfrastructure(SDI)initiativein2001,whichmarked
the beginning of SDI development in Europe. A few years later, this was followed by
the “Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe” (INSPIRE) directive in 2007,
a legal framework that requires EU Member States to share and properly document
20
Digital Earth in Europe
649
harmonized spatial and environmental data as well as establish a dedicated technical
infrastructure. In particular, INSPIRE has become a model in the world; indeed,
with respect to other SDIs solely supporting information discovery and access, it
also addresses data harmonization, which allows them to be used seamlessly across
national borders (EC 2018a).
Big data from space bring new opportunities in Earth Science and, in turn, to
DE. These refer to the massive spatiotemporal Earth and space observation data
collected by a variety of sensors ranging from ground-based to space-borne (EO
satellites, navigation systems) and the synergetic use of data from other sources and
communities (ESA 2019a). The ﬁrst major European activity was the Envisat satellite
missionstartedin2002andoperateduntil2012bytheEuropeanSpaceAgency(ESA)
(ESA 2001). Envisat was the biggest and most complex satellite ever built and carried
9 EO instruments onboard, including imaging, atmospheric and temperature sensors
(ESA 2019b). The mission (with an overall cost of ~2.3 billion euros) was the basis
for the establishment of GMES, the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security
initiative headed by the EC in partnership with ESA and the European Environment
Agency(EEA).Inparticular,itﬁrstaimedtodevelopoperationalinformationservices
on a global scale using both space- and ground-based monitoring systems to support
environment and security policy needs. GMES, ofﬁcially endorsed in 2001, evolved
over the next decade and, after the EU became directly involved in its ﬁnancing
and development, transformed into Copernicus in 2012. Speciﬁcally, Copernicus is
the current EU’s EO and monitoring program, which builds on existing national
and European capacities; it includes both space and ground-based components and
provides users with advanced data services (Copernicus 2019).
Concurrently, Europe has also been massively investing in the development
and implementation of Galileo, its own civilian global navigation satellite system
(GNSS). Galileo, whose conceptualization goes back to 1994, received major eco-
nomic support from 2002 onwards. Two test satellites were successfully launched
in 2005 and 2008, and the ﬁrst satellite of the ﬁnal constellation went into orbit in
2016. As of July 2018, 26 of the 30 planned active satellites have been launched
and the system is expected to be completed by 2021. With respect to other existing
GNSS, Galileo will provide higher precision positioning as well as a series of unique
features aimed at improving people’s security and safety in many ﬁelds.
Citizen science describes the nonprofessional involvement of citizens in a scien-
tiﬁc process (Irwin (1995) and Bonney (1996)). Citizens can participate as observers
or funders, by analyzing data or by providing data; moreover, they freely choose
their degree of involvement based on personal interests, time or resources. After
publishing a dedicated report in 2013 (Science Communication Unit; University of
the West of England 2013), the EC ofﬁcially began promoting and supporting citizen
science due to its potential beneﬁts for European researchers and society at large (EC
2017a). Since then, many projects have been funded that complement hundreds of
dedicated citizen science activities in the different Member States.
In the following, major European contributions to DE are presented in detail.
Section 20.2 is dedicated to an analysis of the information infrastructure in Europe,
and Sect. 20.3 presents the many developments in the context of big data from space

(including Copernicus and Galileo) and its exploitation. Section 20.4 provides an
overview of the most relevant European citizen science projects; Sect. 20.5 intro-
duces the two upcoming major programs supporting future digital innovation, Digital
Europe and Horizon Europe. Finally, a brief conclusion is given in Sect. 20.6.
20.2
Information Infrastructure
A major element of the Europe 2020 Strategy—which set the objectives for smart,
sustainable and inclusive growth of the EU by 2020—is the Digital Agenda. One of
the seven pillars sustaining it is dedicated to the enhancement of interoperability and
standards related to devices, applications, data repositories, services and networks
(EC 2010). Therefore, efﬁcient exploitation of spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) in
combination with open data initiatives and portals have become a key component of
Europe’s efforts to assure more informed decision making as a basis for successful
policy implementation.
The initial concepts related to the systematic realization—and later harmoniza-
tion and linking—of SDIs emerged approximately two decades ago at the national
level when governments began to initiate dedicated frameworks for enhanced uti-
lization and sharing of data and information for applications in the public sector.
These national spatial data infrastructures (NSDIs) primarily included technologies,
standards, organizational and institutional structures, and Directives. The targeted
applications were mostly aimed at sectors such as good governance, smart growth,
or sustainable development (Nebert 2004). The NSDIs usually provide an institu-
tionally sanctioned, automated means for remote search, access, use, and sharing
of geospatial information by various providers and users (Pashova and Bandrova
2017). However, although the NDSIs in Europe often use similar technologies and
standards, each country has many distinctive characteristics that result from speciﬁc
national traditions, cultures and socioeconomic models.
To foster harmonization of the various national SDI developments at the European
level, the EC started the ﬁrst transnational SDI initiative in 2001 (EC 1995), which
was succeeded in 2007 by the “Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe”
(INSPIRE) directive (EC 2007, 2008). INSPIRE represents a legal framework imple-
mented in a phased manner that deﬁnes a set of organizational rules and agreements
for the establishment of an infrastructure for spatial information in the EU by the
end of 2021. At the political level, the Directorate General Environment (DG Envi-
ronment) is in charge of the overall coordination efforts, the Joint Research Centre
(JRC) is responsible for the technical review, and EEA and Eurostat (the European
Statistical Ofﬁce) facilitate application and use case support.
According to the INSPIRE regulations, each Member State has to apply a mini-
mum standard for open access to interoperable harmonized spatial and environmental
data, along with related infrastructures, metadata and network services, which shall
be completed with detailed documentation and reporting, as well as the establish-
ment of a dedicated national coordination institution (EC 2018a). It is important to
20
Digital Earth in Europe
651
note that INSPIRE represents a transversal innovation that capitalizes on the manifold
national and subnational SDIs that were already established and operated in the Mem-
ber States across Europe. Hence, instead of creating any new centralized entity and
data, INSPIRE focuses on making geoinformation seamlessly and easily searchable,
accessible and interoperable across national borders through the harmonization and
uniﬁcation of standards, metadata and tools (EC 2015). A comprehensive overview
of the INSPIRE initiative and contents is provided on the corresponding geoportal
(http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/).
From the thematic point of view, INSPIRE covers 34 themes organized in three
different annexes. These cover data and information related to the cadaster, land use
and land cover, geology and soils, hydrology, agriculture, meteorology, transport and
infrastructure, population, and environmental risks. In this context, one challenging
factor is the requirement that all the data deﬁned in the 34 themes of the three annexes
can be utilized coherently and independently from the intended application. The key
functionalities to fulﬁll this requirement and share the INSPIRE data and metadata
are realized in the form of web-based services (Network Services) employing a
service-oriented architecture (SOA) approach based on well-established standards
such the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) (Döllner et al. 2019). Among others,
the services include the catalogue service for web (CSW), web map service (WMS),
web map tile service (WMTS), web feature service (WFS), web coverage service
(WCS) and sensor observation service (SOS).
To control and evaluate the progress and extent of the INSPIRE implementation in
theindividualMemberStates,thedirectiveprovidestwoindicator-basedmechanisms
(Pashova and Bandrova 2017). Every three years, written reports must be submitted
that address aspects such as coordination and organization structures, infrastructure
management, monitoring of infrastructure and data use, data-sharing models and
agreements, allocated budgets and arising costs, and gains and beneﬁts at national
and subnational levels. In addition, a dedicated set of performance indicators must
be collected by the Member States on a yearly basis, describing the newly developed
geo-information layers with all relevant metadata and related services. This reporting
is administered by the INSPIRE committee, which is composed of representatives of
all Member States, and the respective national contact points. According to the imple-
mentation plan, the Member States were obliged to transpose the directive into their
national legislation by May 2009. Next, they had to provide their relevant national
data collections “as-is” with the corresponding metadata through network services
by December 2013, and all data listed in Annex I had to be accessible and interop-
erable by the end of 2017 (Döllner et al. 2019). Finally, the data covered by annexes
II and III must be in place by end of 2021. In parallel to the Member State activities,
stakeholder communities have been involved from the start of INSPIRE to actively
help shape its implementation and critically review all technical developments.
The mid-term evaluation report published by the EEA in 2014 (EEA 2014)
assessed an adequate progress of the implementation efforts and recommended some
optimizations and improvements to close pending implementation gaps (often due
to ineffective coordination at multiple levels) and foster exploitation of the proﬁts
through intensiﬁed integration of the private sector. Several alternative approaches
652
M. Marconcini et al.
were also applied to assess the progress in the development of SDI/NSDIs based on
various political, institutional, organizational, conceptual, technical, and legal crite-
ria (Pashova and Bandrova 2017). As a result, one of the outcomes was that Austria,
Germany, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and the UK are
among the leading countries in SDI implementation.
Concerning the current challenges related to INSPIRE, the EU countries encoun-
tered many obstacles and shortcomings since the directive was put into effect almost
20 years ago. First, INSPIRE had to be initiated and established under complex con-
ditions. Hundreds of national experts had to develop the technical speciﬁcations and
standards for each speciﬁc thematic sector (including common and legally binding
implementation rules), which had to be translated into more than 24 languages. More-
over, the various Member States showed a rather heterogeneous level of awareness
and readiness in complying with the INSPIRE timelines, technical speciﬁcations
and related recommendations. This effect was further ampliﬁed by the possibility
given to each Member State to decide the most suitable strategy for implementing the
INSPIRE framework based on speciﬁc individual needs. Consequently, the success
of European-wide SDI realization strongly depends on the initiative, strategy and
coherence of NSDI implementation at the national level.
However, the INSPIRE directive generally ensures that national and local gov-
ernments provide high-quality and ready-to-use data and geoinformation to citizens,
science and business across boundaries to support European environmental policies
as well as initiatives such as e-Government and the EU interoperability framework.
The INSPIRE datasets serve the European Water Framework Directive, the Habi-
tats Directive, and the Clean Air Policy Package (EC 2015). INSPIRE makes quite
valuable and direct contributions to the implementation of effective policies across
Europe. The individual Member States also beneﬁt from INSPIRE (Pashova and
Bandrova 2017) due to the signiﬁcantly enhanced access to geospatial information
and the accelerated harmonization of their federal and municipal data inventories,
improving the functionality and efﬁciency of public administration at all levels.
This increased the effectiveness of several services that rely on geospatial data (e.g.,
disaster prevention and response, environmental impact analysis, risk assessment).
In addition, the entry into force of INSPIRE could mitigate the drawbacks due to
widespread national practices (and related business models) of selling geospatial
data and incomplete and inconsistent policy frameworks.
As a means for offering easier access to spatial data in the EU, the Commis-
sion launched the new INSPIRE Geoportal on 18 September 2018 (http://inspire-
geoportal.ec.europa.eu/).Theredesignedportalismeanttobecomea“one-stopshop”
for public authorities, businesses and citizens for discovering, accessing and using
geospatial datasets relevant for speciﬁc application areas, particularly European envi-
ronmental policy (EC 2018b). Moreover, the new Geoportal provides overviews of
the availability of INSPIRE datasets by country and thematic area based on the meta-
data regularly harvested from the national data catalogs of different Member States.
The Geoportal also allows for direct access to the so-called “priority datasets” (that
were jointly selected by the Commission and the EEA) related to environmental
reporting obligations in 6 different domains, “air and noise”, “industry”, “waste”,
20
Digital Earth in Europe
653
“nature and biodiversity”, “water” and “marine”. The priority dataset list is a living
inventory of environmental information needs and provides an instrument for i) mon-
itoring progress on INSPIRE implementation; ii) incrementally building comparable
INSPIRE maturity across Member States based on common settings; iii) planning
tangible and usable INSPIRE deliverables for eReporting; and iv) promoting the
reuse of the INSPIRE infrastructure for reporting purposes.
Of particular interest to the INSPIRE community are the novel funding opportu-
nities offered to Member States by the Connecting European Facilities (CEF) instru-
ment (EC 2018c); as an example, the recent 2018 CEF Telecom Public Open Data
call (with an overall budget of approximately e18.5 million) key objectives include
the generation of cross-border services providing access to harmonized thematic
open datasets and the corresponding metadata.

Big Data from Space
Given the key role of big data (including big data from space), in June 2015 the EC
established the new “Space data for Societal Challenges and Growth” unit within the
Directorate-General “Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs” (DG
GROW). The unit is dedicated to implementing activities supporting the uptake of
big data as a key economic asset to stimulate competitiveness and foster the growth
of the European economy and employment (BDVA 2017). During the same period,
its private counterpart was also established, namely, the Big Data Value Association
(BDVA). The BDVA is an industry-driven international not-for-proﬁt organization
(counting 200 members all over Europe from large, small, and medium-sized indus-
tries and research and user organizations) that aims to develop the innovation ecosys-
tem that will enable data and artiﬁcial-intelligence-driven digital transformation in
Europe to deliver maximum economic and societal beneﬁt. The importance of big
data from space for the EC is further emphasized by the many dedicated calls for pro-
posals included in the different Framework Programs for Research and Technological
Development. Within Horizon 2020 (H2020—the current Framework Program), EO
activities are recognized as a key element to accompany the remarkable EU invest-
ments in Copernicus (i.e., the European EO and monitoring program) and Galileo
(i.e., the EU’s civilian global navigation satellite system—GNSS) (BDVA 2017).
Since 2014, H2020 has funded two work programs (i.e., 2014–2015 and 2016–2017)
and is now running the third for 2018–2020. The “Leadership in Enabling and Indus-
trial Technologies” actions for Space (LEIT-Space) comprise speciﬁc calls dedicated
to EO that target the evolution of Copernicus as well as the exploitation of existing
European space infrastructure for the development of novel products and services
based on remote sensing, geo-positioning and other types of satellite-enabled data.
Other H2020 focus areas also support the uptake of big data from space and related
technologies. These are of particular interest in the Societal Challenge framework in
654
M. Marconcini et al.
support of the “Climate action, environment, resource efﬁciency and raw materials”
challenge, where one of the key actions is dedicated to strengthening the beneﬁts
for Europe of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (BDVA
2017). In addition to these calls, other European intergovernmental organizations
strongly foster the exploitation of big data from space, among which ESA has a
leading position.
Inthefollowing,themostrelevantinitiativeswithaprominentroleofbigdatafrom
space in Europe are introduced. An overview of Copernicus is provided, including
details on its three main components and the newly established data access and
information services (DIAS). Next, the EuroGEOSS initiative is presented, followed
by a description of ESA’s Thematic Exploitation Platforms (TEPs) and a brief review
of Galileo and its major beneﬁts.
20.3.1
Copernicus
The Copernicus program is a cornerstone of the EU’s efforts to monitor the Earth and
its diverse ecosystems, and ensure that European citizens are prepared and protected
in the face of natural or man-made disasters (EC 2016a). Copernicus is Europe’s
eyes on Earth and a symbol of European strategic cooperation in space research and
industrial development. It was established in 2012, building on the previous Global
Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) program, and is coordinated and
managed by the EC in partnership with ESA, the EU Member States and EU Agencies
(Copernicus 2019). Copernicus aims to achieve a global, continuous, autonomous,
high-quality, wide-range EO capacity by bringing together data collected in space, on
the ground, in the sea and in the air to produce timely, reliable and easily accessible
information. Moreover, it grants easy, autonomous and independent access to such
information to support service providers, public authorities and other international
organizations in improving the quality of life for European citizens. The program
also drives economic growth, as it acts as a data source for several applications and
services; recent estimates of the EC predict that its cumulative economic value will be
on the order of 13.5 billion euros in 2008–2020 (EC 2016a). One of the major beneﬁts
of Copernicus relies on the policy for its data and products, which are released to all
users and the public in general on a full, open and free-of-charge basis (EC 2014)
(subject to appropriate conditions and limitations in speciﬁc cases), allowing for the
development of several downstream services.
Copernicus comprises three different components: Space, In Situ and Core Ser-
vices.
• The Space component includes the 5 families of dedicated Sentinel satellites as
well as existing national and international missions (both commercial and public),
known as the Copernicus Contributing Missions. The development of the Space
component, including the launch and operation of the Sentinels and management
of the ground segment, was delegated to ESA. The European Organization for the
20
Digital Earth in Europe
655
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) coordinates the provision
of space data and operational support for the climate change, marine environment
and atmosphere monitoring services;
• TheCopernicusInSitucomponentisresponsibleforgatheringenvironmentalmea-
surements collected by data providers external to Copernicus, including ground-
based, sea-borne or air-borne monitoring systems, as well as geospatial reference
or ancillary data, collectively referred to as “in situ” data. It also identiﬁes data
access gaps or bottlenecks, supports the provision of cross-cutting data and man-
ages partnerships with data providers to improve access and use conditions;
• The Copernicus Core Services produce value-added products available to the pub-
lic that are generated based on the space and in situ data from the other two
components. Products include six speciﬁc services: land monitoring, marine envi-
ronment monitoring, atmosphere monitoring, emergency management, security,
and climate change.
In the following, each component is presented in detail.
20.3.1.1
Space Component
The success of Copernicus is possible due to a well-engineered Space component for
the provision of EO data to feed into a range of services to monitor the environment
and support civil security activities. With more than 30 years of experience imple-
menting missions to monitor Earth from space, ESA is responsible for developing
and managing this core component of the program. The Space component includes
ESA’s families of dedicated Sentinel satellites and missions from other space agen-
cies, referred to as contributing missions. A uniﬁed ground segment through which
the data are streamed and made freely available for the Copernicus Services com-
pletestheSpacecomponent.ESAisestablishingamechanismtointegrate,harmonize
and coordinate access to all the relevant data from the multitude of different satellite
missions (ESA 2019c). This is being carried out in close cooperation with national
space agencies, EUMETSAT and, where relevant, owners of non-European missions
contributing to the Copernicus objectives.
The Sentinels carry a range of technologies such as radar and multispectral imag-
ing instruments for land, ocean and atmospheric monitoring (ESA 2019c).
• Sentinel-1 provides all-weather, day and night radar imagery for land and ocean
services. The twin satellites Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B were launched on 3rd
April 2014 and 25th April 2016, respectively, and the mission currently delivers
high-resolution data globally every 6 to 12 days at a rate of 2.5 TB per day. In
January 2019, more than 3.5 million products were available for download, with
a total volume of more than 5.5 PB of data;
• Sentinel-2 provides high-resolution optical imagery for land services. The twin
satellites Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B were launched on 22nd June 2015 and 7th
March 2017, respectively. After March 2018, the mission has a revisit frequency
656
M. Marconcini et al.
of 5 days worldwide. In January 2019, approximately 8 million products were
available for download, with a total volume of more than 4.2 PB of data;
• Sentinel-3 provides high-accuracy optical, radar and altimetry data for marine and
land services. The twin satellites Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B were launched on
16th February 2016 and 25th April 2018, respectively. The mission will reach a
revisit time shorter than 2 days globally with an expected rate of 0.3 TB of data
per day;
• Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 (whose launches are planned for 2021 and 2020, respec-
tively) will provide data for atmospheric composition monitoring from geostation-
ary and polar orbits, respectively;
• Sentinel-5 Precursor was launched on 13th October 2017 and bridges the gap
between Envisat (which delivered data from 2002 to 2012) and Sentinel-5; and
• Sentinel-6 (whose launch is planned for 2020) will provide radar altimetry data
to measure global sea-surface height, primarily for operational oceanography and
climate studies.
The contributing missions include 30 past, existing and planned missions from
ESA, the Member States, EUMETSAT and other European and international third-
party mission operators that share part of their data with Copernicus (ESA 2019c).
They are grouped in 5 different categories:
• Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, for all weather day/night observations
of land, ocean and ice surfaces (e.g., TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X, RADARSAT-2,
ALOS/PALSAR, Kompsat-5);
• Very high resolution (VHR) optical sensors for targeting speciﬁc sites, mostly in
urban areas and for security applications (e.g., WorldView-1/2/3/4, Kompsat-2/3,
DEIMOS-2, SPOT-5/6/7);
• High-resolution and medium-resolution optical sensors for supporting regional/
national land monitoring activities (e.g., Landsat-5/7/8, Proba, DEIMOS-1);
• Medium-low-resolution optical sensors for gathering information on land cover
as well as for monitoring oceans, coastal dynamics and ecosystems (e.g., Proba-V,
Oceansat-2);
• High-accuracy radar altimeter systems for sea level measurements and climate
applications (e.g., Envisat RA-2);
• Radiometers to monitor land and ocean temperature (e.g., ODIN); and
• Spectrometer measurements for air quality and atmospheric composition moni-
toring (e.g., GOSAT).
Notably, the free and open access policy of Copernicus has triggered unprece-
dented opportunities for both academia and industry. The main challenges are the
growing volume of data from the Space component and its heterogeneity (in terms of
formats, semantics, measurements, resolutions, and modalities) due to the diversity
of sensors employed. Accordingly, volume, variety, velocity and veracity apply to
this type of datasets, which cannot be handled by traditional databases and process-
ing methodologies; rather, they require advanced preprocessing, data harmoniza-
tion, analytics, and uncertainty propagation analyses and the deployment of suitable
knowledge models (BDVA 2017).

20.3.1.2
In Situ Component
The Copernicus In Situ component comprises a number of environmental local mea-
surements collected from ground-based, sea-borne or air-borne monitoring systems.
These are used to calibrate, assess and supplement the information provided by satel-
lites, which is essential to deliver consistent and reliable data over time (EC 2015).
The In Situ component includes data collected from sensors mounted onboard air-
planes or weather balloons, positioned on riverbanks or high towers, drifting in the
ocean on buoys or pulled through the sea by ships. Background topographic infor-
mation (e.g., digital elevation models, administrative boundaries, transportation net-
work maps) also falls under the In Situ umbrella, along with information collected
by citizen scientists or volunteer contributors (e.g., OpenStreetMap) as well as data
gathered by unmanned aerial vehicles—UAVs (i.e., drones) (EC 2015).
The In Situ component mostly includes contributions from the Copernicus Mem-
ber States, since a consistent part of the data and monitoring infrastructure is owned
and operated by single national governments. However, it also beneﬁts from inter-
national efforts to collect and share information, in many cases from international
research infrastructures. To guarantee reliable and sustainable provision of data for
its services, Copernicus has to effectively coordinate with a variety of providers,
from local conservation groups to global meteorological bodies. The goal of the In
Situ component is to comprehensively explore the complex and manifold landscape
of local data, identify gaps by comparing requirements against available information,
support the provision of cross-cutting data, and establish and manage partnerships
with data providers to improve the conditions of access and use (EC 2015). Timely
implementation of the INSPIRE directive is expected to improve access to local
datasets and considerably facilitate data discovery and access operations. INSPIRE
will also improve the timeliness and quality of the Copernicus services.
All Copernicus service operators are granted direct access to data from the In Situ
component as an integrated part of their workﬂows and according to their day-to-
day operational needs (provided that they set up and manage the technical interfaces
themselves). Since December 2014, under a delegation agreement with the EC, EEA
has been appointed coordinator of this component (EC 2015).
20.3.1.3
Core Services
The Copernicus Core Services provide standardized multipurpose information com-
mon to a broad range of application areas relevant to EU policies in six differ-
ent domains, namely, ocean (CMEMS 2019), land (CLMS 2019) and atmosphere
(CAMS 2019) monitoring, emergency response (CEMS 2019), security (Copernicus
Security Service 2019), and climate change (C3S 2019). The effective use of big data
(from the Space and In Situ components) and advanced data mining techniques are
two key elements to their success. The development of the preoperational version of
the services was undertaken a few years ago through a series of projects launched by
the EC and partly funded through the EU’s 7th Framework Program (FP7). These
658
M. Marconcini et al.
projects were: MyOcean (ocean), Geoland2 (land), MACC and its successor MACC
II (atmosphere), SAFER (emergency response) and G-MOSAIC (security). Most of
them also contributed to the monitoring of climate change. In each of the target the-
matic areas, the range of products developed in response to users’ needs is growing,
along with the number of users. In addition, projects designed to explore the scope
for downstream services supporting specialized topics have been launched, widening
the range of available products. These will directly support national, regional or local
activities as well as niche European and global markets. Below, additional details are
provided for each of the existing Core Services.
Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS): CAMS is implemented
by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf
of the EC. It has been fully operational since 2014 and provides businesses, pol-
icy makers and scientists with consistent and quality-controlled information on the
atmosphere anywhere in the world; it also allows for assessing the past (based on the
analysis of historical data records) and generating predictions for the next few days.
The service monitors and forecasts parameters related to air pollution and health,
solar energy, greenhouse gases and climate forcing. CAMS also compiles emissions
inventories to support modeling and estimation of the CO2 and CH4 ﬂuxes at the
Earth’s surface. The main application domains beneﬁting from use of this service
include renewable energies, meteorology, climatology, environmental monitoring
and health.
Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS): CMEMS has
been operational since 2015 and provides regular and systematic core reference
information on the state of the physical oceans and regional seas. It delivers data
and products that support major applications in the marine area such as maritime
operations (e.g., search and rescue, transport and ship routing, marine safety), marine
resources (e.g., ﬁshery, aquaculture), coastal and marine environment (e.g., coastal
erosion, sea temperature monitoring, water quality monitoring, pollution control).
It also provides key information for weather, climate and seasonal forecasting (e.g.,
temperature, salinity, currents, wind, sea ice). By jointly exploiting satellite data and
in situ observations, the service provides state-of-the-art analyses and forecasts on
a daily basis, which offer an unprecedented capability to observe, understand and
anticipate marine environment events.
CopernicusLandMonitoringService(CLMS):CLMShasbeenoperationalsince
2012 and comprises 4 main components: i) a global component providing a series
of qualiﬁed biogeophysical global products on the status and evolution of the land
surface (e.g., albedo, land surface temperature, top-of-canopy reﬂectance) at mid to
low spatial resolution, which are used to monitor the vegetation, water cycle, energy
budget and terrestrial cryosphere; ii) a Pan-European component aimed at generat-
ing land-use/land-cover maps (i.e., CORINE) and high-resolution layers (HRSLs)
describing the 5 major land cover types, i.e., artiﬁcial surfaces, forest areas, agricul-
tural areas (permanent grasslands), wetlands, and water bodies; iii) a local component
providing speciﬁc and more detailed information that is complementary to the Pan-
European component and is focused on identiﬁed hotspots (i.e., major EU city areas,
riparian zones, grassland rich sites) prone to different environmental challenges; and
20
Digital Earth in Europe
659
iv) an imagery and reference data component gathering satellite images and in situ
data, forming the input for the creation of many information products and services
(e.g., the Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey—LUCAS database).
Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S): C3S has been operational since
2018 and addresses the environmental and societal challenges related to the cli-
mate changes associated with human activities. C3S supports the adaptation and
mitigation policies of the EU by providing consistent and authoritative information
about the past, present and future climate, as well as tools to enable climate change
mitigation and adaptation strategies by policy makers and businesses. The service
complements the established range of meteorological and environmental services
that each European country has in place and provides access to several climate indi-
cators (e.g., temperature increase, sea level rise, ice sheet melting, ocean warming)
and climate indices (e.g., based on records of temperature, precipitation, and drought
events). C3S is implemented by ECMWF and relies on climate research carried out
within the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) responding to user require-
ments deﬁned by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).
Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS): EMS produces timely and
reliable geo-spatial information derived from satellite and in situ data supporting the
management of geophysical, meteorological and man-made hazards, as well as emer-
gency situations and humanitarian crises. The service comprises 2 different compo-
nents: i) an on-demand mapping component that provides maps for rapid emergency
response as well as risk and recovery maps, bolstering the decision-making pro-
cess in all the phases of the emergency cycle (i.e., preparedness, prevention, disaster
risk reduction, emergency response and recovery); and ii) an early warning com-
ponent including the European Forest Fire Information System—EFFIS (aimed at
monitoring forest ﬁres and forest ﬁre regimes in the European, Middle Eastern and
North African regions) and the European Flood Awareness System—EFAS (aimed
at providing ﬂood forecasts to support ﬂood risk management).
Copernicus Security Service: This service tackles Europe’s security challenges by
providing key information to support crisis prevention, preparedness and response
improvement in three application areas: (i) border surveillance—to increase the
internal security of the European Union using near real-time data over land and sea,
as well as ﬁght cross-border crime and reduce the death toll of illegal immigrants
at sea; (ii) maritime surveillance—to increase maritime security in the framework
of navigation, ﬁsheries control, marine pollution, and law enforcement by jointly
exploiting Sentinel-1 and other sources of maritime information; and (iii) support to
EU External Action—to assist third-world countries in crisis situations and prevent
global and trans-regional threats with potential destabilizing effects using available
geo-information for remote areas experiencing critical security issues.

20.3.2
Data Access and Information Services
To improve access to big data from space and maximize the beneﬁt to different user
communities (on an equal basis to all Member States and countries participating in
the program), the EC recently funded the development of 5 competitive cloud-based
platforms known as data and information access services (DIAS) (CREODIAS 2019;
MUNDI 2019; ONDA 2019; SOBLOO 2019; WEKEO 2019). The DIAS allow for
centralized access to Copernicus data and products and offer advanced computing
resources and tools (open source and/or on a pay-per-use basis) for online processing
and analysis (Copernicus 2019). This will create the possibility to easily build new
applications and offer added-value services. Each platform also provides access to
additional commercial satellite or nonspace datasets, and premium offers in terms of
priority or support. By providing a single access point for all Copernicus data and
information, the DIAS allow for users to develop and host their own applications
in the cloud (ensuring protection of intellectual property rights), without the need
to download bulky ﬁles from multiple access points and process them locally. This
will enable simpler and more user friendly exploitation and data combination, and
thus promote innovation. Furthermore, competition between the DIAS will ensure
that the best service is delivered to the users and avoid customer lock-in on a speciﬁc
platform among the 5 (Copernicus 2019). A DIAS functionally consists of 3 types
of services:
• Back ofﬁce services that provide access to Copernicus data and information
(unlimited, free and complete), as well as to any other data offered by the DIAS
provider, in a scalable computing environment where users can build and operate
their own services;
• Interface services encompassing tools that facilitate users in the development of
applications. This environment is developed and managed by the DIAS service
providers (according to their speciﬁc business models) and offers scalable com-
puting and storage resources to the users at competitive commercial conditions;
• Front ofﬁce services that are provided by third parties (e.g., EU Projects, ESA,
EUMETSAT, developers and companies) and are based on exploitation of the
Copernicus data and products available through the back ofﬁce services.
The success of DIAS strongly depends on the strong relationship between the
different Copernicus actors as well as on the involvement of Member States and
participating countries, information and communication technology (ICT), the EO
industry and third parties interested in using Copernicus data and information. The
support to and integration of the DIAS into the workﬂows of ESA and EUMETSAT
is expected to further enrich the environment offered by the platforms. Moreover, the
integration of DIAS and DIAS-based services into the European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC) will make it possible to connect the EO domain to other ﬁelds of science
at a European level, facilitating the transition from research to commercialization
(BDVA 2017).

20.3.3
Thematic Exploitation Platforms
ESA is Europe’s gateway to space and its main mission is to shape the development
of Europe’s space capability and ensure that investments in space continue to deliver
beneﬁts to the citizens of Europe and the world. For more than 20 years, EO satellites
developed or operated by ESA have provided a wealth of data, which is increasing
like never before, especially due to the Sentinel missions. This expanding operational
capability of global monitoring from space and data from long-term EO archives,
models and in situ networks allow for unprecedented insight into the interconnections
of the Earth system between oceans, ice, land and atmosphere. However, while the
amount of big data from space represents a key opportunity for academia and indus-
try, it also poses major challenges to achieving comprehensive exploitation of the
data. Several initiatives are currently supported by ESA through different programs,
among which the development and implementation of the Thematic Exploitation
Platforms (TEPs) started in 2014 has a prominent role (ESA 2019d). The TEPs sup-
ply a collaborative virtual work environment that provides—through one coherent
interface—access to the following:
• relevant big data from space;
• computing resources and hosted processing;
• a platform environment that allows for users to integrate, test, run, and manage
applications without the need to build and maintain their own infrastructure;
• standard platform services and functions including collaborative tools, data mining
and visualization applications, development tools (e.g., Python, IDL), communi-
cation tools (e.g., social networks), as well as documentation, accounting and
reporting tools; and
• repositories of advanced processing applications (including those developed by
other users).
Moreover, the user community is present (and visible), directly involved in the
governance of the platforms and enabled to share and collaborate (ESA 2019d).
Seven different TEPs have been developed, each addressing a speciﬁc area of
environmental research, namely, geohazards (GEP 2019), forestry (F-TEP 2019),
hydrology (H-TEP 2019), food security (Food Security TEP 2019), as well as costal
(C-TEP 2019), polar (Polar TEP 2019) and urban areas (U-TEP 2019). In the fol-
lowing, additional details are provided for each TEP.
Geohazards TEP (GEP): The GEP aims to support the exploitation of satellite
EO information for geohazards and is based on the Supersites Exploitation Platform
(SSEP), originally initiated in the context of the Geohazard Supersites & Natural Lab-
oratories (GSNL) initiative (SSEP 2016). The core user communities for the GEP are
the groups of practitioners working on the Seismic Hazards Pilot (CEOS 2019a) and
the Volcano Pilot (CEOS 2019b) of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites
(CEOS). The former is a three-year demonstration project intended to showcase the
beneﬁts of EO satellite data in the context of seismic hazard research, whose major
goals are to (i) support the generation of globally self-consistent strain rate esti-
mates and mapping of active faults at the global scale; (ii) support and continuation
662
M. Marconcini et al.
of the GSNL for seismic hazards and volcanoes; and (iii) develop and demonstrate
advanced science products for rapid earthquake response. The main objectives of the
Volcano Pilot through the GEP are to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of integrated,
systematic and sustained monitoring of Holocene (i.e., the current geological epoch)
volcanoes using space-based EO; (ii) demonstrate the applicability and improved
timeliness of space-based EO products for reducing the impact and risk of eruptions;
and (iii) build the capacity for exploiting EO data in volcanic observatories in Latin
America to showcase global capacity development opportunities.
Coastal TEP (C-TEP): Sustainable coastal development requires accurate and
easily accessible knowledge about the dynamic processes shaping coastal zones
as well as suitable long-term analysis and automatic trend detection tools. The C-
TEP provides a dedicated service for observation and monitoring of the coastal
environment. The integration of satellite and near real time (NRT) EO data, in situ
data and model predictions in the virtual platform provide an effective means to
characterize and understand the many linked coastal processes across a wide range
of space and time scales. Key applications include coastal bathymetry, coastal change
monitoring, and early warning for pollution discharges, harmful algal blooms and
storm surges.
Forestry TEP (F-TEP): The F-TEP vision is to be a one-stop shop for forestry
remote sensing applications. The platform offers online processing services and
tools (e.g., versatile satellite image analysis, GIS software) for generating value-
added forest information products by means of simple and easy-to-use push-button
functionalities. It also supports the generation of forest and land cover maps, change
maps, and the estimation of continuous forest variables (e.g., growing stock vol-
ume). The F-TEP serves users with expertise in forestry rather than EO as well as
remote sensing professionals and service providers. These include UN REDD (i.e.,
the United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation) and other international programs, national forest inventories, universi-
ties and research centers, forest managers, land use planning and nature conservation
agencies, as well as value-adding industry and sustainable development NGOs. The
platform is closely coordinated with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO), the JRC and the Global Forest Observation Initiative (GFOI).
Hydrology TEP (Hydro-TEP): As water affects all societal and environmental
domains, there is a major need for integrated, open water information services offer-
ing efﬁcient access to cross-regional and multidisciplinary water information. This
is even more critical in the developing world, where data are generally sparse. The
Hydro-TEP aims to facilitate exploitation, processing and visualization of different
types of data (EO, in situ, socioeconomic or meteorological) to better comprehend
water-related challenges by combining a holistic understanding of the water cycle
with evidence-based governance and increased public awareness. The main services
supported by the platform are water quality monitoring, ﬂoods and drought risk,
climate change forecasts and hydropower and aquaculture assessment. Current users
of the Hydro-TEP comprise water authorities, regional mandated authorities, river
basin organizations, and universities and research centers.

Polar TEP: The polar regions are remote and hostile environments where collect-
ing data is strongly hindered by the extreme weather conditions, lack of infrastruc-
ture and long periods of darkness during the winters. As a consequence, satellites are
the only source of consistent, repeatable, year-round and wide-area coverage infor-
mation. Polar TEP enables users to access and exploit this information to support
their operations and science as efﬁciently as possible. The main current applica-
tions include iceberg risk assessment, derivation of ice sheet and ice stream surface
velocities, and ice concentration and thickness estimation. An initial pilot project
was carried out to demonstrate the potential of the platform to investigate the cur-
rent and future iceberg risk in Bafﬁn Bay. Different datasets, processors and models
have been deployed and integrated to allow for investigating linkages between ice-
berg populations, observed and modeled changes in ice sheet movement and calving
rates, ocean circulation and iceberg trajectories. Current user communities of the
Polar TEP include scientiﬁc researchers, industry, local indigenous populations, and
regional and national governments.
Urban TEP (U-TEP): From the beginning of the 2000s, more than half of the
global human population is living in urban environments, and the dynamic trend of
urbanization is growing at an unprecedented speed. The U-TEP aims to open up
new opportunities to facilitate effective and efﬁcient urban management and safe-
guard livable cities by systematically exploring the unique EO capabilities in Europe
in combination with the big data perspective arising from the constantly growing
sources of geo-data. The platform is envisaged to initiate a step change in the use of
EO data and geospatial analytics by enabling any interested user to easily exploit and
generate thematic information on the status and development of the built environment
based on multisource data collections (e.g., EO imagery, statistics, surveying, and
volunteered geographic information). The capabilities of participation and sharing
of knowledge by using new media and ways of communication will help boost inter-
disciplinary applications with an urban background. The U-TEP provides a unique
portfolio of thematic products and services and, by the end of 2018, was success-
fully used to process more than 3 PB of EO data and activate a community of more
than 300 institutions from all around the world (including the UN, the World Bank,
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development—OECD, the World
Food Program and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation).
Food Security TEP: The challenge of increasing the food supply to feed a growing
global population makes the sustainability of agriculture and aquaculture as critical
as ensuring food security. Food production systems need to optimize the use of water,
energy and fertilizers, reduce pollution and soil degradation, and maximizing high-
quality agricultural yields and ﬁsh harvest under increasingly unstable environmental
conditions. To support future sustainable and efﬁcient farming and aquaculture, the
Food Security TEP (i) offers direct access to key satellite products and derived data;
(ii) allows for on-the-ﬂy computation, visualization and manipulation of basic key
indices; and (iii) provides high-accuracy, quality-checked biophysical parameters
that are suitable for use in operational scenarios. The Food Security TEP builds on
a large and heterogeneous user community that includes small-scale farmers and
agricultural industry, public science and the ﬁnance and insurance sectors, local and
664
M. Marconcini et al.
national administrations and international agencies. A forum of experts from this
community (i.e., the Partnership for Growth and Sustainability) supported ESA in
deﬁning the project requirements, and enables the team to continually develop the
platform in accordance with their needs.
20.3.4
EuroGEOSS
The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is a partnership of more than 100 national
governments, 100 participating organizations and the EC. It envisions a future where
decisions and measures for the beneﬁt of humankind are informed by coordinated,
comprehensive and sustained EO. A central part of the GEO’s Mission is to build
GEOSS, i.e., a set of coordinated, independent EO information and processing sys-
tems that interact and provide access to diverse information for a broad range of users
in the private and public sectors (GEO 2019). EuroGEOSS is the European compo-
nent of GEOSS and complements the other three ongoing GEO initiatives, namely,
AfriGEOSS in Africa (initiated in 2013), AmeriGEOSS in the Americas (initiated
in 2014), and AOGEOSS in Asia and Oceania (initiated in 2015). EuroGEOSS will
be a gateway for European EO programs and projects to GEOSS, with Copernicus
as a major element (GEO 2019). Its added value will comprise the following (EC
2017b):
• the user-driven systematic coordination, integration and scaling up of existing ser-
vices (based on a wide range of data sources) to address sustainable development
goals—SDGs, GEO societal beneﬁt areas—SBA (e.g., biodiversity and ecosystem
sustainability, food security and sustainable agriculture, sustainable urban devel-
opment, energy and mineral resources management) and other GEO priorities in
the European context;
• the leveraging of global datasets through the GEOSS common infrastructure (GCI)
and their exploitation within a European context; and
• additional support to Copernicus to address new communities within GEO and act
as an incubator for possible new Copernicus services and applications supporting
European priorities.
It is not the objective of EuroGEOSS to establish new data platforms in Europe.
Rather, it builds on the GCI and DIAS to take advantage of multiple, existing or
upcoming capacities in Europe, including the INSPIRE database, the Copernicus
Space component, Copernicus Core Services products, output products from services
offered by the TEPs, citizen observations, and additional data/products from agencies
and organizations (e.g., ESA, EUMETSAT, ECMWF) (EC 2017b).
The exploitation of EO data and products, including Copernicus, and the subse-
quent market creation will be boosted by global cooperation approaches regarding
data collection, processing and codesign of information products within the GEOSS
context. A more coherent European action towards GEO would complement existing
20
Digital Earth in Europe
665
national and supra-national strategies, leverage EO European investments including
those from the commercial sector and reduce fragmentation within Europe.
The initial phase of EuroGEOSS was supported through H2020. The EuroGEOSS
roadmap 2017–2019 foresaw an initial phase to establish EuroGEOSS during the
fourth quarter of 2017, a consolidation phase to start addressing EuroGEOSS pilot
applications in 2018 and a third phase in 2019 to showcase the EuroGEOSS added
value (EC 2017b).
At the heart of the EuroGEOSS is the ambition to foster the European user dimen-
sion in the process of scaling up existing multidisciplinary pilot applications. Empha-
sis is placed on the “last mile” of the innovation process, enabling preoperational
services that could extend/reinforce other GEO initiatives and ﬂagships. For this pur-
pose, reviews of European user needs will be conducted on a regular basis to consider
all possible European user communities involved in ongoing GEO tasks as well as
other communities in Europe identiﬁed by EuroGEOSS members (EC 2017b). The
initiative will take full advantage of the many user platforms and consultation pro-
cesses that are conducted at continental, national and local levels by the members
of the European GEO Caucus. EuroGEOSS will aggregate user demand at regional
levels from both GEO-aware and GEO-unaware European users. This process will
ensure pilot applications driven by structured, consolidated user needs of regional
signiﬁcance.
20.3.5
Galileo
The original idea for Galileo—Europe’s own global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)—dates back several decades. Galileo was agreed upon in 1994 and, after
many delays and setbacks, became available in December 2016 and is foreseen to
reach full operational capability by 2021 (Reillon 2017). The system is operated by
the European GNSS Agency (GSA) and ESA, with the program oversight by the EC
and the political oversight by the European Council and the European Parliament.
Galileo allows for users to determine their location and the location of other
people or objects at any given moment, and the ability to determine their velocity
and the current system time. It is interoperable with GPS and GLONASS, (i.e., the
US and Russian GNSS, respectively), and by relying on a large constellation of
satellites and exploiting multiple frequencies, it will provide better service to the
users, with real-time positioning accuracy in the meter range (Hecker et al. 2018c).
At full deployment, Galileo will comprise 30 satellites (24 operational, plus 6 in-orbit
spares) 26 of which have been launched as of July 2018. This large number, together
with the optimized constellation design and the availability of three active spare
satellites per orbital plane, ensure that the loss of one should not have a discernible
effect on the users. Moreover, contrary to all other GNSS, Galileo will provide good
coverage even at latitudes higher than 75°N (i.e., corresponding to the most northerly
tip of Europe) (Hecker et al. 2018c).
666
M. Marconcini et al.
Galileo has several other unique technical features. The two most relevant are
the Search and Rescue (SAR) return data link for user notiﬁcation and the signal
authentication for civil users. Both represent important technologies that are expected
to provide high added value to EU citizens and worldwide users.
To support the SAR function, satellites are equipped with a transponder, which is
able to transfer the distress signals from a user’s transmitter to regional rescue coor-
dination centers, which then initiate rescue operations. The system sends a response
signal to the users, informing them that the situation has been detected and help
is on the way. This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade to the
existing systems, which do not provide user feedback (Hecker et al. 2018c). The
Galileo SAR service represents Europe’s contribution to the worldwide satellite-
based distress signal detection and localization system COSPAS-SARSAT (where
COSPAS is an acronym for the Russian “Cosmicheskaya Sistema Poiska Avariynyh
Sudov”, which translates to “Space System for the Search of Vessels in Distress”
and SARSAT is an acronym for search and rescue satellite-aided tracking). Cur-
rently supported by 44 countries, COSPAS-SARSAT was established by Canada,
France, the former Soviet Union and the United States in 1979 and provides help
to people in danger in the context of aviation, vessels, worldwide expeditions, and
people equipped with personal locator beacons (COSPAS-SARSAT 2019). Galileo
complements COSPAS-SARSAT with additional satellites and sensibly improves
the coverage and accuracy of the located emergency position. Moreover, several
research projects supported by the GSA under Horizon 2020 are creating end-to-end
solutions based on the Galileo SAR service and leveraging its return link.
Galileo is the only GNSS envisaged to provide open and free signal authentica-
tion (Galileo GNSS 2017), i.e., a technical mechanism that allows for verifying if the
received navigation signals truly originate from the stated source. Galileo is expected
to start transmitting the “Open Service Navigation Message Authentication” in mid-
2019 (EGSA 2019a). This feature will help effectively mitigate deliberate signal
manipulation and strongly increase the security for Galileo-based timing and posi-
tioning applications (especially in critical and safety-relevant ﬁelds).
Since all other GNSS constellations are operated by organizations with a military
background, there has been concern that navigation signals might be degraded or
rejected for civil use (even in speciﬁc regions only). Dedicated techniques have been
developed similar to the GPS’ “Selective Availability”, which intentionally reduced
the quality of its open signal until the year 2000 (Hecker et al. 2018c). Although these
tacticswererarelyusedinthepast,theiremploymentcannotbecompletelyprecluded,
with potentially dangerous consequences as GNSS are increasingly used in safety
critical applications and highly relevant infrastructure. Operated under civil control,
Galileo ensures Europe’s strategic autonomy with respect to satellite positioning
under all circumstances, thus avoiding the abovementioned dependencies and risks.
This will also strengthen the EU’s position, which can actively inﬂuence the GNSS
strategy and pave the way for long-term investments and technologies.
The range of applications that Galileo is expected to support is vast and spans
different market segments in both the private and public sectors (EGSA 2019b). The
most relevant comprise the following:
20
Digital Earth in Europe
667
Emergency, security and humanitarian services: Galileo’s SAR service will
help save lives, e.g., in the event of an airplane or boat crash. The system will also
be an invaluable asset for border control authorities and coastguards (e.g., ensuring
faster rescue operations) and to support security-related applications (e.g., helping
locate missing persons, stolen property or lost pets).
Environment and weather: Galileo will support geology, geodesy and meteorol-
ogy research in mapping and measuring of oceans, tides and sea levels, and tracking
icebergs, pollutants and dangerous goods. Moreover, it will allow for improving the
quality of atmospheric measurements (especially the level of water vapor, which is
particularly important in the context of weather forecasting), to advance the study
of the ionosphere and space weather, and to better monitor (and hence comprehend)
the movements of animal populations.
Agriculture:Galileowillbecomeanassetfortheagriculturecommunity.Through
the joint exploitation of in situ information, it will allow for improved parcel yield
due to customized treatments, improved monitoring of the distribution and dilution
of chemicals, and more efﬁcient property management.
Fisheries: Galileo will provide ﬁshermen with improved navigational aids and
allow for more accurate and effective exchange of information between vessels and
stations. The SAR service will be particularly important to the ﬁshery industry.
Energy: Galileo’s high-quality time synchronization will result in better services
for the transportation and distribution of energy; modern energy networks strongly
rely on accurate location systems (e.g., in case of failure, power grids monitoring
instruments will be synchronized with maximum accuracy). Furthermore, by exploit-
ing Galileo’s services, marine drilling activities will become safer in the gas and oil
ﬁelds (where precise time measurements are fundamental when employing seismic
streamer or gun arrays).
Once fully operational, Galileo will offer 4 different high-performance services
worldwide (EGSA 2019c):
• Open Service (OS): open and free of charge positioning and timing services;
• Commercial Service (CS): complements the OS by providing an additional navi-
gation signal and added-value services in a different frequency band (the CS signal
can be encrypted to control access to the service);
• Public Regulated Service (PRS): restricted to government-authorized users to sup-
port sensitive applications requiring high-level service continuity; and
• Search and Rescue Service (SAR): in support of COSPAS-SARSAT.
Although Galileo is running behind its original schedule, many application
domains are already proﬁting from its entry into operation and many more will
do so in the near future. This is also due to the system interoperability with other
GNSS, which results in more satellites in view and thus more measurements and
improved accuracies (Hecker et al. 2018c).
Furthermore, it is foreseen that Galileo and the European Geostationary Navi-
gation Overlay Service—EGNOS (a system based on a network of ground stations
and 3 geostationary satellites that combines GPS and Galileo signals to improve the
accuracy and robustness of navigation in Europe), will provide consistent economic
668
M. Marconcini et al.
beneﬁts to the European space industry, as well as for a variety of downstream
GNSS-based services and applications. These are estimated to be on the order of
~ 130 billion euros for 2014–2034 (against the total Galileo costs of ~ 16 billion
euros from the early 1990s until 2020) (Hecker et al. 2018c).
20.4
Citizen Science
The term citizen science (CS)—coined by Irwin (1995) and Bonney (1996) in the
mid-1990s—describes the nonprofessional involvement of citizens in a scientiﬁc pro-
cess. The concept of CS has been rapidly adopted in the international and European
policylandscapeaswellasbythescientiﬁcresearchcommunityandhasreceivedcon-
siderableattentioninrecentyears.However,CSisnotanewphenomenon.Depending
on the deﬁnition, the concept of the participation of citizens in scientiﬁc processes
can be traced back to the eighteenth century (Mahr et al. 2018). The ﬁeld of CS is
diverse, and there is no universally accepted deﬁnition. According to SiS.net (2017),
CS can be described as a method to practice scientiﬁc research at larger scales, as
a movement that democratizes scientiﬁc research processes or as a social capacity
to produce knowledge. Various approaches of determining a deﬁnition for the term
CS are discussed by Eitzel et al. (2017). The EC has used various deﬁnitions for CS
in its policy documents. In EC (2016b), the deﬁnition of the Oxford English Dictio-
nary (OED 2014) is applied: CS is “scientiﬁc work undertaken by members of the
general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional sci-
entists and scientiﬁc institutions”. Instead, in the H2020 work program 2018–2020
(EC 2018d) the deﬁnition “Citizen Science […] covers a range of different levels
of participation: from raising public knowledge about science, encouraging citizens
to participate in the scientiﬁc process by observing, gathering and processing data,
right up to setting scientiﬁc agenda and co-designing and implementing science-
related policies” is used. In this context, the European Citizen Science Association
(ECSA) developed ten principles of CS, which complement the above-mentioned
deﬁnitions (ECSA 2015; Robinson et al. 2018). For a general overview of the most
relevant CS activities in addition to those discussed in this chapter related to the
European framework, refer to Chap. 18.
20.4.1
Citizen Science in the European Policy Landscape
The EC emphasizes the opportunities of CS in its Open Science Policy by stating
“Citizen Science can contribute to the Commission’s goal of Responsible Research
and Innovation, as it reinforces public engagement and can redirect research agen-
das towards issues of concerns to citizens” (EC 2016b). CS is recognized by the
EC as an important pillar of the Open Science (OS) concept and, together with
Open Access, is at the forefront of new frameworks for research and innovation. The
20
Digital Earth in Europe
669
assignment of CS to OS, which is implied by this statement, is controversial. Science
Europe (2018), an association of European research funding organizations (RFOs)
and research performing organizations (RPOs), argues that CS is increasingly con-
sidered an independent discipline whereas DITOs (2018) and Hecker et al. (2018a)
see them as equal disciplines that enrich and partly depend on each other.
In 2013, the EC dedicated an entire report to environmental CS, which highlighted
the role of new and emerging mobile technologies for CS and the perception of the
quality of research by CS and discussed the inﬂuence of CS on European environ-
mental policymaking (UWE 2013). Together with the outcomes of a green paper on
CS by socientize (EC 2013) and the resulting white paper on CS for Europe in 2015
(Sanz et al. 2015), the results of the report prepared the ground for the aforemen-
tioned statements on CS in the EU Open Science Policy “Open Innovation, Open
Science, Open to the World—a Vision for Europe” (EC 2016b) and were streamlined
into the EC Action Plan for Environmental Reporting (Action 8) (EC 2017c) and the
Horizon 2020—Work Program 2018–2020 (EC 2018d). The level of consideration
of CS in the upcoming Horizon Europe Program is still under discussion.
For the practical implementation of CS, JRC is the EU organization with the
highest activity level (Science Europe 2018). The JRC is collaborating with several
other EU institutions (including EEA) in the Environmental Knowledge Community
(EKC), which investigates the creation and exchange of knowledge in environmental
policy making processes and the role of CS in environmental policy making (Schade
et al. 2017). The EKC operates a Knowledge and Innovation Project (KIP) on CS,
with a focus on how CS data could be used qualitatively to complement European
environmental monitoring and reporting processes. Another activity of the JRC that
directly addresses European policy making is the development of a CS platform (EC
2019a). The platform will support CS projects and foster the consideration of their
needs in the European policy making process.
The EC observes the development of CS projects with the Open Science Monitor
(EC 2019b), which currently utilizes the repositories of SciStarter (https://scistarter.
com/) and Zooniverse (https://www.zooniverse.org/). In 2016, a detailed EU-wide
survey on CS was conducted (see Fig. 20.1). It showed that the majority of CS projects
were initiated in Central and Western Europe and that the primary subject of most
projects was in life sciences. In 2018, JRC published an inventory of environmental
CS projects based on a study of a consortium of the EC (DG Environment, DG JRC),
Bio Innovation Service (FR), Fundacion Ibercivis (ES) and The Natural History
Museum (UK) (Bio Innovation Service 2018). It identiﬁed 503 projects (444 with
participating actors from European countries, 12 European initiatives, 29 global
initiatives and 18 from other regions; see Fig. 20.2). Even though both studies have a
different focus and might not cover all activities, they show that the CS engagement
of Eastern European countries has increased.

FP7 and H2020 Citizen Science Projects
With its Research and Innovation programs, the EU is an active funder of CS ini-
tiatives. The Seventh Framework program (FP7) was the EU funding program from
2007 to 2013, its successor H2020 is the framework program for 2014 to 2020, which
will be followed by Horizon Europe. Some of the projects aim to enable CS participa-
tion and raise the general awareness of environmental and societal challenges; other
projects focus on the involvement of citizens to engage in speciﬁc research questions.
The following summary provides an incomplete overview of funding sections with
instances of CS-related projects:
CAPS (Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innova-
tion): The CAPS seek new models to create awareness of emerging sustainability
challenges. They aim to offer collaborative solutions based on modern information
and communication technologies. A range of CAPS have been funded and are listed
at https://capssi.eu. Among them, two of the most interesting are:
• MakingSense, which offers a toolkit of open source software and hardware, digital
maker practices and open design that enables citizens and local communities to
engage in pressing environmental questions (www.making-sense.eu); and
• SOCRATIC: whose main objective is to provide citizens and organizations with
collaborative space and allow for them identify innovative solutions to achieve the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (www.socratic.eu).
SwafS (Science with and for Society): The SwafS program objective is to build
effective cooperation between science and society. The “Responsible Research and
Innovation” program supports the design and implementation of innovative ways to

on an inventory of CS activities for environmental policies”. Twelve projects were listed as being on
the European scale, and 26 were on a global scale. In addition, 444 projects had participants from
European countries (multiple countries can be assigned to one project). Source own illustration

connect science and society more broadly (http://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/). In
this framework, two representative activities are:
• DITOs (Doing It Together Science), which connects research institutions, muse-
ums, science galleries and art institutions to engage people with CS in Europe
(http://togetherscience.eu/); and
• SPARKS, which is an awareness-raising project dedicated to familiarizing and
engaging European citizens with the concept and practice of Responsible Research
and Innovation (RRI) (http://www.sparksproject.eu/).
Citizen Observatories: Citizen observatories commonly exploit the capabilities
offered by the citizens’ own devices (EC 2018e). Under the FP7 Environment Theme,
5 CS observatories were funded: COBWEB (biosphere monitoring), CITI-SENSE
(air pollution monitoring), WeSenseIt (ﬂood and drought monitoring) OMNISCIEN-
TISTS (odor monitoring) and Citclops (coastal and water quality monitoring). Four
672
M. Marconcini et al.
others have been established through the H2020 Societal Challenge 5 (climate action,
environment, resource efﬁciency and raw materials), namely, SCENT, Ground Truth
2.0, the GROW Observatory and Landsense (which contributes to EO analyses in the
framework of land use and land cover monitoring (https://landsense.eu/)). Projects
have also been undertaken to improve the coordination between CS observatories
in Europe and support the integration of their outcomes in European policy (Gold
2018) (e.g., WeObserve www.weobserve.eu).
COST (European cooperation in science and technology): COST aims to con-
nect research initiatives across Europe with initiatives outside Europe to enable
researchers and innovators to develop ideas in any ﬁeld of science and technology
in cooperation with their peers. This includes the fostering of citizen participation in
research activities (www.cost.eu). Interesting activities include:
• Citizen Science COST Action CA15212, which aims to investigate and extend the
impact of the educational, policy, scientiﬁc and civic results and achievements of
CS to use it for social innovation and socioecological transition (http://cs-eu.net/);
and
• Networking Lake Observatories in Europe (NETLAKE) COST Action ES1201,
which was funded from 2012 to 2016 and aimed to monitor 25 European lakes
with the support of CS methods (NETLAKE 2017).
Notably, the FP7 socientize project aimed to promote the usage of science infras-
tructures and considered society itself as infrastructure for e-science by utilizing
technology, innovation and creativity. Socientize compiled the aforementioned green
and white papers on CS for Europe (Sanz et al. 2015) (www.socientize.eu).
20.4.3
Initiatives and Platforms in EU Member States
and Public Organizations
In addition to CS projects and actions that are mainly based on funding by EU pro-
grams, many initiatives developed in Europe with national funding or through private
and institutional engagement. A prominent role is played by the ECSA, a nonproﬁt
association aimed at encouraging the growth of CS in Europe. It was launched in
2013 and consists of European and international individual and organizational mem-
bers (Science Europe 2018). To foster policy advances and initiate and strengthen CS
in Europe, the ECSA published ‘Citizen Science as part of EU Policy Delivery-EU
Directives’ (ECSA 2016) and developed ten principles of CS (ECSA 2015; Robinson
et al. 2018) for use in discussions with the EC. Several governments of EU Mem-
ber States and public organizations actively support CS, particularly environmental
protection agencies. One example is the Scottish Environment Protection Agency
(SEPA), which fosters CS initiatives with a large support infrastructure, including
best-practice guidance to support public authorities (Pocock et al. 2014). CS plat-
forms and capacity-building initiatives increase the visibility of projects and help

cultivate networks in the CS community (Hecker et al. 2018b). They produce train-
ing materials, distribute new developments and establish contacts to policy makers,
scientists and stakeholders (Bonn et al. 2016, Richter et al. 2018). Examples of
such platforms are Bürger schaffen Wissen (www.buergerschaffenwissen.de, Ger-
many), Österreich forscht (www.citizen-science.at, Austria), Schweiz forscht (www.
schweiz-forscht.ch, Switzerland), Observatorio de la Ciencia Ciudadana en España
(http://ciencia-ciudadana.es, Spain) and the Scottish Citizen Science Portal (https://
envscot-csportal.org.uk/, Scotland). A consortium of the nonproﬁt research associ-
ations Helmholtz and Leibniz, together with university partners, leads the Bürger
schaffen Wissen (GEWISS) program in Germany. It published the green paper Citi-
zen Science Strategy for 2020 (Bonn et al. 2016), which describes the understanding,
requirements and processes of CS in Germany. For an extensive overview of Euro-
pean CS projects, we refer the reader to the Inventory of citizen science activities
for environmental policies (EC 2018e) and the accompanying report (Bio Innovation
Service 2018).
20.5
Digital Europe and Horizon Europe
To support future digital innovation (a fundamental prerequisite for effective imple-
mentation of DE in the coming years) in the framework of the next long-term EU
budget for 2021–2027, the Commission is proposing two major programs: Digital
Europe and Horizon Europe (EC 2018f, 2019c).
Digital Europe builds on the Digital Single Market strategy launched in May 2015
with the main objectives of increasing the EU’s international competitiveness and
shaping Europe’s digital transformation for the beneﬁt of citizens and businesses.
The program will promote the large-scale deployment of digital technologies across
economic sectors and will support the digital transformation of public services and
businesses (EC 2019c). With a budget of e9.2 billion, Digital Europe will boost
frontline investments in key relevant contexts:
• high-performance computing: e2.7 billion will be invested in projects aimed
at strengthening supercomputing and data processing in Europe, with a goal of
deploying a world-class supercomputer and data infrastructure with exascale capa-
bilities (i.e., billion calculations per second) by 2022–2023 and post-exascale facil-
ities by 2026–2027;
• artiﬁcial intelligence (AI): e2.5 billion will be allocated to activities supporting
the uptake of AI across the European economy and society, taking into account
all the correlated socioeconomic changes and ensuring an appropriate legal and
ethical framework. The idea is to create open ‘European libraries’ of algorithms to
support both the public and private sectors to identify the most suitable solutions
for their needs. The establishment of digital innovation hubs across the EU will
also make it possible for small business and local innovators to access testing
facilities;
674
M. Marconcini et al.
• cybersecurity: e2 billion will be dedicated to boosting cyber defense and the EU’s
cybersecurity industry. This will be carried out by ﬁnancing state-of-the-art cyber-
security equipment and infrastructure as well as by supporting the development
of the necessary knowledge and skills;
• advanced digital skills: e700 million will be invested to form the current and
future workforce through training courses and traineeships aimed at providing
the necessary advanced skills to access supercomputing, artiﬁcial intelligence and
cybersecurity; and
• ensuring wide use of digital technologies: e1.3 billion will support the digital
transformation of public administration and related services, as well as their inter-
operability within the EU. Digital innovation hubs will become “one-stop shops”
for both public administrations and small/medium-sized enterprises by providing
access to technological expertise and experimentation facilities.
In addition to Digital Europe, ﬁnancing for research and innovation in next-
generation digital technologies will continue and be reinforced under the upcoming
Horizon Europe program. Horizon Europe is the successor of H2020 and will be
the biggest research and innovation funding program ever, with an overall budget of
approximately e100 billion (EC 2018f). The new program will reinforce the Union’s
scientiﬁc and technological bases to help address major global challenges and con-
tribute to achieving the United Nations SDGs; moreover, at the same time, it will
boost the Union’s competitiveness, including that of its industries. Horizon Europe
will help deliver on the Union’s strategic priorities and support the development and
implementation of its policies. The program is designed around three main pillars: (i)
the Open Science pillar, which supports researchers through fellowships, exchanges,
and funding to projects deﬁned and driven by researchers; (ii) the Global Challenges
pillar, which directly supports research addressing societal challenges; and (iii) the
Open Innovation pillar, which aims to make Europe a front runner in market-creating
innovation.
Horizon Europe is expected to generate the following:
• new (and more) knowledge and technologies, promoting scientiﬁc excellence and
impact. It will continue facilitating cross-border collaborations between innovators
and top scientists, as well as allow for trans-national and cross-sector coordination
between public and private investment in research and innovation;
• positive effects on growth, trade and investment ﬂows as well as on quality jobs and
international mobility for researchers in the European Research Area. The program
is expected to increase the GDP by an average of 0.08–0.19% over 25 years (which
corresponds to a potential return of up to e11 for each euro invested over the same
period); and
• signiﬁcant social and environmental impacts created by translating scientiﬁc
results into new products, services and processes, which will help successfully
deliver on political objectives, as well as social and eco-innovation.
20
Digital Earth in Europe
675
The Digital Europe and Horizon Europe programs will work hand-in-hand: Hori-
zon Europe provides key investments in research and innovation, and Digital Europe
builds on these results to create the necessary infrastructure and support deployment
and capacity building, which will provide input for future research in AI, robotics,
high-performance computing and big data.
AI is foreseen to become the main driver of economic and productivity growth
and will contribute to the sustainability and viability of the industrial base in Europe.
Accordingly, the Union aims to develop trusted AI based on ethical and societal val-
ues, building on its Charter of Fundamental Rights; people should trust AI and beneﬁt
from its use for their personal and professional lives. Thus, the Communication “Ar-
tiﬁcial Intelligence for Europe” of 25 April 2018 proposed a dedicated strategy that
supports the ambition for Europe to become the world-leading region in developing
and deploying cutting-edge, ethical and secure AI (EC 2018g). Furthermore, in the
related coordinated Action Plan of 7 December 2018, the Commission explicitly
proposed the development and deployment of dedicated AI capacities, taking direct
advantage of Copernicus data and infrastructure to foster geo-location-based services
to support agriculture, air quality, climate, emissions, the marine environment, water
management, security and migration monitoring, and citizen science (EC 2018h).
These will be accompanied by initiatives supporting AI-based exploitation of EO
data and information in both the public and private sectors.
20.6
Conclusions
Most of the visionary features of the original DE view formulated by Al Gore in 1998
were implemented in practice only 10 years later in several web-mapping platforms
and desktop virtual globes. This led to an evolution of the DE concept, in light of the
concurrent advancements in technology and research, as well as changes in society.
DE expanded its role in other ﬁelds (e.g., related to global climate change, natu-
ral disaster prevention and response) and transformed into a more practical system
design to fulﬁl the demand for information sharing and overcome the socioeconomic
inequality in accessing and using the data. In a few years, Europe became one of the
key players in DE at the global level. Through the INSPIRE Directive, it created a
legal framework for the establishment of a European SDI relying on single NDSIs. By
jointly supporting data discovery, access and harmonization, INSPIRE has become a
model in the world and its complete entry into force in 2021 will become a milestone
for the implementation of transnational services. Furthermore, the EO mass data col-
lected within the Galileo and Copernicus programs place Europe at the forefront of
the big data from space paradigm. Galileo will enable higher precision positioning,
with consequent key improvements in a variety of applications (especially once full
operation begins in 2021). Moreover, its SAR and signal authentication features will
improve people’s security and safety in many ﬁelds. Copernicus provides continuous
monitoring of our planet through a comprehensive set of sensors mounted onboard
676
M. Marconcini et al.
the Sentinel satellites (whose families will grow in the next decade) as well as a num-
ber of environmental local measurements. From such a wealth of data, the ultimate
goal of the program is to generate key information for the users; this is directly car-
ried out by the different core services and made possible through novel cloud-based
platforms such as the DIAS and the TEPs. The last 5 years saw the increasing emer-
gence of CS in Europe, which proved to be an effective tool to support researchers
and society at large, with hundreds of projects and initiatives funded throughout
the different EU Member States. The implementation of dedicated platforms facili-
tated the uptake of CS in different ﬁelds and raised awareness of environmental and
societal challenges. Further advancement is expected in the near feature, e.g., by
giving citizens the possibility of collecting and contributing real-world data through
novel (and connected) sensors directly immersed in their environments. Europe has
clear plans for the future and is creating a basis to establish an overall framework
in which DE will gain even more importance. This will be possible by means of the
Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programs. The former will support research and
innovation by strengthening the scientiﬁc and technological bases of the Union and
fostering its global competitiveness and innovation capacity; the latter will procure
high-tech resources and skills for use by European businesses and the public sector.
In both cases, the effective integration of cutting-edge AI will be one of the main
challenges in the next years.
In conclusion, the European experience illustrates that big data from satellites are
a fundamental aspect for the future of DE, as they will allow for analyses that were
unimaginable just few years ago. To maximize their beneﬁt, the implementation of
processing platforms that enable advanced processing are essential (the integration of
novel AI-based methodologies is one of the priorities), as well as the establishment of
effectiveSDIstosharederivedproductsandguaranteeaccesstothembeyondnational
borders. In this framework, the role of citizens can become a key asset through their
involvement in directly collecting and sharing data and actively providing feedback.

Digital Earth in Australia
Zaffar Sadiq Mohamed-Ghouse, Cheryl Desha and Luis Perez-Mora
Abstract Australia must overcome a number of challenges to meet the needs of
our growing population in a time of increased climate variability. Fortunately, we
have unprecedented access to data about our land and the built environment that is
internationally regarded for its quality. Over the last two decades Australia has risen
to the forefront in developing and implementing Digital Earth concepts, with several
key national initiatives formalising our digital geospatial journey in digital globes,
open data access and ensuring data quality. In particular and in part driven by a lack
of substantial resources in space, we have directed efforts towards world-leading
innovation in big data processing and storage. This chapter highlights these geospa-
tial initiatives, including case-uses, lessons learned, and next steps for Australia.
Initiatives addressed include the National Data Grid (NDG), the Queensland Globe,
G20 Globe, NSW Live (formerly NSW Globe), Geoscape, the National Map, the
Australian Geoscience Data Cube and Digital Earth Australia. We explore several
use cases and conclude by considering lessons learned that are transferrable for our
colleagues internationally. This includes challenges in: 1) Creating an active context
for data use, 2) Capacity building beyond ‘show-and-tell’, and 3) Deﬁning the job
market and demand for the market.

Introduction
In this chapter, the authors demonstrate the need for local, champion-based initiatives
to support mainstreaming, integration and take-up globally. This includes progress
made in the digital earth agenda, and the creation of a repository that can be used
by researchers, policy makers, decision-makers and the community at large. The
chapter describes the lessons learned in Australia, which are likely to be immediately
transferrable and of beneﬁt to other initiatives around the world. The chapter outlines
precedents and examples of innovation arising from the need to better manage local
resources, and addresses the complexities of environmental stewardship and the
extraction and processing of natural resources.
In the global move towards automation, employment and productivity (Manyika
et al. 2017), Australia must overcome a number of challenges to meet the needs of its
growing population in a time of increased climate variability, from sustainably man-
aging and restoring natural environments to developing resources and optimizing
our agricultural potential. Increasingly frequent environmental extreme events such
as chronic drought, extreme bushﬁres, and ﬂooding have catalyzed internationally
regarded innovation in this ﬁeld, in addition to the requirement for large-scale infras-
tructure planning along the eastern seaboard and in northern Australia (Australian
Government 2015), and the national need to report on performance—in relation to
people and planetary systems—through the United Nations Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals (Griggs et al. 2013). Within this context, senior mentors in the ﬁeld
Steudler and Rajabifard reﬂect that sharing information through a spatial data infras-
tructure (SDI) can facilitate improved decision-making, where themed images and
temporal overlays can quickly engage different communities in common understand-
ing and appreciation of issues and potential solutions (Steudler and Rajabifard 2012;
Rajabifard and Crompvoets 2016).
Fortunately, Australians have unprecedented access to current and historical data
about land and the built environment that is internationally regarded for its quality.
Australia has been at the forefront in the development and implementation of Digital
Earth concepts over the last two decades (Woodgate et al. 2017). In recent years,
several key national initiatives have also formalized the Australian digital geospatial
journey, shaping its world-leading initiatives and credentials in digital globes, open
data access and quality:
• The Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information (CRCSI), launched in
2003 and recently transitioned to ‘FrontierSI’, has driven numerous initiatives in
research and technological innovation, market and product development, work-
force planning and preparedness, and outreach. Three seminal Global Outlook
reports (Woodgate et al. 2014; Coppa et al. 2016, 2018) provide excellent content
for a more detailed exploration of the Australian geospatial progress, in addition
to a White Paper on the context and priorities of the future of spatial knowledge
infrastructure (Duckham et al. 2017).
• The National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA), launched in 2015, com-
prises 24 initiatives. With a AUD $1.1 billion direct allocation of federal funds,
21
Digital Earth in Australia
685
it inﬂuences approximately AUD $10 billion per annum in government-related
expenditure on innovation (Coppa et al. 2018:6).
• The 2026 Agenda (co-chaired by Cockerton and Woodgate 2016, 2017, 2019),
developed from extensive consultation, provides the vision and direction to enable
the geospatial community to deliver national and global services supporting the
NISA. This landmark initiative involved the CRCSI (now FrontierSI), the Spa-
tial Industries Business Association-Geospatial Industry Technology Association
(SIBA-GITA), the Australia New Zealand Land Information Council (ANZLIC—
Australia and New Zealand’s peak government Council for spatial matters), the
Australian Earth Observation Community Coordination Group, Data61 (CSIRO),
Landgate, Geoscience Australia, Department of Natural Resources and Mines
(Queensland Government), and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.
• Substantial digital infrastructure projects in broadband services around the coun-
try, including the National Broadband Network (NBN) and Australia’s Academic
and Research Network (AARNet), owned by the Australian universities and the
Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which
provides internet services to the Australian education and research communities
and their research partners. AARNet is widely regarded as the founder of the
internet in Australia and is renowned as the architect, builder and operator of a
world-class high-speed, low-latency network for research and education (AARNet
2018).
Domestically, the country has directed efforts towards world-leading innovation
in big data processing and storage (for example, see Dhu et al. 2017), without owner-
ship of substantial resources in space (AAS 2009) and with only-recent establishment
of a Space Agency. Furthermore, Australia is large enough for the Earth’s curvature
to be important, and its tectonic movement is signiﬁcant enough to require a dynamic
cadaster. Hence, Australia’s digital earth history has been grounded in an empha-
sis on a planar geometry—where geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are
mathematically projected onto a two-dimensional plane using a Universal Transverse
Mercator system—in comparison with other chapters in this manual that emphasize
the globe.
Within this context, in 2017 the federal government established Digital Earth
Australia (DEA), building on the Geoscience Australia ‘Data Cube’ supported by
CSIRO, the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI), and the National Col-
laborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). This includes funding of
AUD $15.3 M/year going forward within the federal budget. When completed, it
will provide 10-meter resolution image data nationwide, allowing for multitemporal
analyses throughout the stack of co-registered data for as far back as 30 years and as
detailed as 16-day intervals.
Looking ahead, Australia has identiﬁed its most promising growth sectors for
the spatial industry: transport, agriculture, health, defense and security, energy, min-
ing, and the built environment, with the environment requiring special consideration
(ACIL 2015; Cockerton and Woodgate 2017). A signiﬁcant challenge concerns
building capacity for widespread uptake of geospatial technologies and tools across
686
Z. S. Mohamed-Ghouse et al.
these key growth sectors, where open-data use, real-time crowd-sourcing of infor-
mation, and visualization are integrated within core decision-making processes.
Within this context, this chapter provides commentary on key geospatial initia-
tives, case-uses, lessons learned, and next steps for Australia, drawing primarily
from published material in the public domain and experiences of the Authors. The
chapter presents a summary of a number of initiatives, including the National Data
Grid (NDG), the Queensland Globe, G20 Globe, NSW Live (formerly NSW Globe),
Geoscape, the National Map, the Australian Geoscience Data Cube and Digital Earth
Australia. It also highlights key products and projects currently being undertaken by
Digital Earth Australia. The chapter includes exploration of several use cases in agri-
culture, property, education and training, and disaster management, and concludes
with a consideration of lessons learned and next steps in Australia.
21.2
An Historical Context of Geospatial Initiatives
It has been a busy two decades for the Australian geospatial community, with a
number of key products developed by state and federal governments. As illustrated
in Fig. 21.1, these initiatives are indicative of a growing awareness of and appetite
Fig. 21.1 Illustration of the history of digital earth in Australia
21
Digital Earth in Australia
687
for access to data that can result in meaningful decision-making, addressing three
important principles for Digital Earth (Desha et al. 2017):
(1) Open data: Harnessing the potential of open, transparent, rapid access to com-
prehensive data and information to harvest the plethora of data sets for mean-
ingful problem solving. Australia ranked ﬁrst on the Global Open Data Index
that measures how well nations publish open government data against 14 key
categories (Wallace 2017a).
(2) Real-world context: Decision-making support frameworks that integrate spa-
tial information and sustainable development aspirations, including the United
Nations’ sustainable development goals. Australia’s Open Data Cube (ODC)
objectives include building the capacity of users to address these goals in addi-
tion to those of the Paris and Sendai agreements (Coppa et al. 2018:84).
(3) Informed visualization for decision support: i.e., making visual sense of the
complex, dynamic and increasingly interrelated systems of today and the future.
Among the world’s 23 unique virtual globe platforms and four virtual globes
that are visualization applications only, Australians have access to an expanding
array of support tools (Keysers 2015), with exciting prospects for user function-
ality improvements.
In the following paragraphs, we brieﬂy introduce the features of these products,
how they have evolved over time, how they are being used to increase end-user take up
of geospatial products and services, and the contributions that led to the formation of
Digital Earth Australia (Sect. 21.3). Several use cases are also provided in Sect. 21.4.
21.2.1
National Initiatives
21.2.1.1
2008–2010: CRCSI’s National Data Grid (NDG)
The National Data Grid (n.d.) was developed by the CRCSI to support the spa-
tial enquiry needs of modelers and decision support systems, as conceptualized in
Fig. 21.2. The developers had a vision to develop a shared infrastructure that could
provide an economical and effective means to integrate spatial information from a
variety of sources and formats to support commonly required query, analytical and
modeling tasks.
The resultant NDG was essentially an integrated data platform that adopted a grid
cell (i.e., raster) based approach to managing spatial information, which could assist
professionals with little or no knowledge of geospatial science in performing simple
and replicable spatial queries and analyses. It included three components (CRCSI
2009):
• National Nested Grid: a set of standard nested grids with an innovative indexing
system to facilitate and promote spatial consistency in a cost-effective manner.
688
Z. S. Mohamed-Ghouse et al.
Fig. 21.2 A conceptualization of the national data grid (Source CRCSI 2011)
• National Data Grid Demonstrator Application: a publication data store with a web-
based function, rich data querying and data visualization environment for users to
access and publish grid cell data.
• National Data Grid Raster Storage Archive: a high-capacity backend data store
for efﬁcient and cost-effective storage and management of large datasets.
To raise awareness about the full potential of the NDG, the CRCSI funded the
development of an online proof of concept ‘NDG Demonstrator’ (Spatial Vision
2011). Built upon an earlier collaboration into a ‘Platform for Environmental Mod-
eling Support’ (Chan et al. 2008), several scenarios including crop growth, a bio-
diversity index and climate evaluation were used to showcase the core technical
components and opportunities to interact with the product for national and jurisdic-
tional agencies and the public, and opportunities to address scalability issues (CRCSI
2011). IP created in the NDG project was also subsequently used in a pivotal $3.4 M
initiative funded by the Australian Space Research Program to build Earth observa-
tion infrastructure enabling processing of the national LANDSAT imagery archive
of more than 30 years of data.
21
Digital Earth in Australia
689
21.2.1.2
2014: NICTA’s NationalMap
National ICT Australia (NICTA) developed ‘NationalMap’ for the Department of
Communications and Geoscience Australia as a public tool for accessing and map-
ping open data and users’ private data (National Map, n.d.). The NationalMap pro-
vides a map-based view of data but does not store data. Selected data viewed on
the map is typically accessed directly from the relevant government department or
agency.
The initiative was designed with a focus on interoperability and open source
code, supporting the government’s commitment to policy visualization and open
data (NAA, n.d.). It was developed as open source software (available as a GitHub
project) using user-centered design methods. Now managed by the Department of the
Prime Minister and Cabinet, the open source software is available as a GitHub project.
The web front-end uses NICTA’s TerriaJS software, which was initially developed
by Data61 for NationalMap and has subsequently been used for other projects.
An example of NationalMap use documented in Australia’s Digital Continuity
2020 Policy is the Australian Renewable Energy Mapping Infrastructure (AREMI)
platform owned by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (NAA, n.d.). AREMI
uses NationalMap to create an open-source, three-dimensional mapping platform to
convert and visually display information that works in any modern browser without
plug-ins or specialized software on the user’s computer. It facilitates evaluation of
renewable energy project developments through gathering relevant spatial datasets
in one location at the same time. End-user ﬂexibility is key; ﬁnanciers and investors
can ascertain the potential viability of ventures, and project developers can freely
access ground and resource measurements to assist with site assessment and design.
State and local governments can also use the information to assist with community
and stakeholder engagement, tracking and promoting projects, and reviewing and
assessing environmental and regulatory planning approvals.
NationalMap requires data to be formatted in a particular way to be machine
readable and presented spatially. The Australian Government is continuing to work
with agencies to assist with data formatting requirements and compatibility with
Australian and international data standards, and have produced the AusGEO CSV
standard as a guide to provide consistent formatting.
21.2.1.3
2017: PSMA’s Geoscape: Australia’s National 3D Data Set
PSMA Australia is an independent and self-funded entity, formed in 1993 by the state
governments of Australia to collate, transform and deliver the national government’s
geospatial data as national datasets (PSMA 2009). The company undertook its ﬁrst
major initiative in 1996, supporting the national Census by providing Australia’s ﬁrst
digital national map at the street level.
In 2017, the company launched Geoscape as a suite of digital datasets that repre-
sents buildings, surface cover and trees across urban and rural Australia, as shown in
Fig. 21.3. Using a reliable geospatial base, the national dataset spatially represents
690
Z. S. Mohamed-Ghouse et al.
Fig. 21.3 Geoscape product summary (Source Paull and Rose 2017)
every building with a roof area greater than 9 m2, for use by industry and government.
This is equivalent to approximately 15 million buildings spanning 7.6 million km2
across the entire country (Schubert 2017).
The data set links numerous land and property features related to physical struc-
tures, land and vegetation, and geographical locations. This includes links to impor-
tant geospatial reference datasets including geocoded addresses, property data,
administrative boundaries, 3D building attributes, land cover details, tree heights,
and information on roof materials, swimming pools, and solar panels. It is regularly
updated, providing a narrative of the changing landscape, and has links to other
PSMA products including G-NAF (addresses), Cadlite (cadastre and property) and
Administrative Boundaries (suburb/localities). As PSMA’s CEO Dan Paull reﬂects
in a Geoscape Blog (2017), “Time and location-stamping have moved data from
position to precision, giving a more accurate reﬂection of the built environment.
Organisations can now make sharper decisions with more efﬁciency and greater
conﬁdence.”
Working in partnership with DigitalGlobe for satellite imagery, the company has
used a combination of satellite imagery, crowd-sourcing and machine learning to
develop a new process for recognizing and extracting insights from images. The
result is an analytics-ready product that is globally replicable and depicts the full
built environment (PSMA 2017a). At the time of writing, the roll-out of mapped
locations was underway (see https://www.geoscape.com.au/rollout/).
The following are two examples showcasing the capabilities of Geoscape:
• The Greater Launceston Transformation Project: Geoscape provides the essential
foundational data to enable a cost-effective, accurate solution for smart cities and
smart suburbs in the Tasmanian city of Launceston. The Sensing Value company is

and demonstrate the impact of development decisions, mobility patterns, energy
consumption, land use and other strategic and operational insights for urban and
regional planning’ (PSMA Australia 2017b).
• GeoVision™: Developed in collaboration with Pitney Bowes, this product is a
suite of datasets including Geoscape that combines information on the 3D built
environment with information such as addresses, postcodes and ABS Census data.
(PSMA Australia 2017c). End users include retail, utilities and construction clients
seeking to accelerate decision-making and increase efﬁciency as well as banking,
ﬁnancial services and insurance users. It aids insurers in risk modeling for setting
insurance premiums and assists with telecommunications infrastructure planning.
21.2.1.4
2017: Australian Geoscience Data Cube—‘Open Data Cube’
(ODC)
The Australian Geoscience Open Data Cube—otherwise known as the Open Data
Cube, (ODC)—aims to realize the full potential of Earth observation data holdings
by addressing the big data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise
limit its usefulness (Lewis et al. 2016). The result of several years of iterations of
partnership between Geoscience Australia (GA), the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and
Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the National Computational Infras-
tructure (NCI), it is the ﬁrst case in which an entire continent’s geographical and
geophysical attributes have been made available to researchers and policy advisors.
(NCI Australia 2018). It provides users with access to free and open data management
technologies and analysis platforms, with the ability to observe historical changes
in land use and patterns over time using the infrastructure shown conceptually in
Fig. 21.4.
The foundations and core components of the AGDC are (Lewis et al. 2016):
(1) Data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth
observation data to produce standardized surface reﬂectance measurements that
support time-series analysis and collection management systems that track the
provenance of each Data Cube product and formalize reprocessing decisions;
(2) The software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and
(3) The supporting high-performance computing environment provided by the Aus-
tralian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).
This data cube approach allows for analysts to extract rich new information from
Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full
spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. As noted in the
introduction, due to the size of Australia, the Earth’s curvature is important and its
tectonic movement is fast enough to require a dynamic cadastre. With an emphasis
on a planar geometry, the Data Cube’s ﬂat base is actually an illusion that enables a
useful platform to engage with the data.
692

illustration of the data cube,
showing Landsat scenes
reformatted as spatially
consistent tiles of data
(Source Lewis et al. 2016)
To enable easy uptake and facilitate future cooperative development, the code
was developed under an open-source Apache License, Version 2.0. This approach
enables other organizations including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites
(CEOS) to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries. Advances in
cloud computing and the availability of free and open technologies such as the Open
Data Cube (ODC) mean that developing countries without the local infrastructure to
process large volumes of satellite data can access data and computing power to build
relevant applications and inform decision making.
21.2.2
State Initiatives
21.2.2.1
2013: The Queensland Globe and G20 Globe
The Queensland Globe was created in 2013 by the Queensland Government’s Depart-
ment of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and was released by the Department
as part of the State’s open data initiative aimed at increasing the number of publicly
available datasets (https://qldglobe.information.qld.gov.au/). As the ﬁrst Australian
example of combining Google Earth and government spatial data into a standalone
application, it used the familiar Google Earth viewer to ﬁnd and download free
reports and information such as cadastral maps and coal seam gas well and water
bore reports.
21
Digital Earth in Australia
693
Subsequently, Google announced they were no longer going to support Google
Earth Enterprise, and the new Queensland Globe was developed using the Esri
JavaScript API 4.x and Esri REST web services application hosted on Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Beanstalk. Its web services were published using ArcGIS Server
from departmentally hosted servers. The Globe currently includes 652 data layers
from almost every Queensland Government department and is now accessed straight
from a browser, so users are no longer required to download Google Earth.
An adaptation of the Queensland Globe, the G20 Globe was produced for the G20
Summit held in Brisbane in 2014. Proﬁling Queensland to world leaders including
Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, the G20 Globe illustrates the global economic
ecosystem from the perspective of Queensland. It shows the value of spatial tech-
nology for exploring economic activity in our globally interconnected world across
six economic sectors, including agriculture, construction, resources, tourism, science
and innovation and education and training. As an exemplar, the G20 Globe reveals
the opportunities and competitive advantages in agriculture, construction, resources,
tourism, science and innovation in Queensland. It demonstrates the value of open
data and the capacity to merge it with digital technology so users can follow eco-
nomic stories that begin with domestic supply chains and are linked to expansive
market demands around the world.
At the time of the G20 summit, Queensland University of Technology went a
step further than the Queensland Globe and G20 Globe, developing a state-of-the-
art interactive digital display called the CUBE (Fig. 21.5) to teach school children
geography and science in an innovative way. Consisting of 48 multi-touch screens
across two stories, the Cube is open to the public to view and facilitates opportunities
for discovery, visualization and contribution to research projects as ‘citizen scientists’
by experiencing real project scenarios and exploring 21st century challenges (QUT,
n.d.).

21.2.2.2
2018: NSW Globe and Live Cadastral Platform
In New South Wales, the state government’s Spatial Services initiated NSW Globe
and a cloud-based ‘cadastre as a service’ platform to upgrade its maintenance of the
NSW cadastre, including an application that lets the public access cadastral data in
real time (Bishton 2018). The new API-based system is targeted at the automated
backbone of the development application submission process for councils, reducing
duplication of data and effort. Previously, plans were accepted in hard copy and
manually scanned whereas the new submission process automatically extracts data
and metadata from digital plans, and images are converted to validated LandXML.
TheDCDBremains thesystemof record, updatedviathenewAPI, andtheLandXML
and GeoTIFF ﬁles are stored in the cloud.
The system is part of a digital transformation of the surveying industry, and the
beneﬁts of this system include more efﬁcient land subdivision and reduced cost of
development to market. The public will also be encouraged to contribute data to
the platform, which supports the NSW Government’s spatially digital agenda. Other
initiatives such as dMarketplace, a sharing place for data, include a rating scheme
for data sources (Wallace 2017b).
21.3
Digital Earth Australia
In2017,theAustraliangovernmentlaunchedDigitalEarthAustralia(DEA)toimple-
ment the open source analysis platform developed as part of the ODC initiative dis-
cussed above. The DEA program contributes code, documentation, how-to guides,
tutorials, and support to domestic and international users of the Open Data Cube. As
a platform, it uses spatial data and images recorded by orbiting satellites to detect
physical changes in unprecedented detail.
Drawing on data from as far back as 1987, DEA translates almost three decades
of Earth observation satellite imagery into information and insights about the chang-
ing Australian landscape and coastline, providing a ground-breaking approach to
organizing, analyzing, and storing vast quantities of data (DEA 2017). Using high-
performance computing power provided by the National Computational Infrastruc-
ture and commercial cloud computing platforms, DEA organizes and prepares satel-
lite data into stacks of consistent, time-stamped observations that can be quickly
manipulated and analyzed to provide information about a range of environmental
factors such as water availability, crop health and ground cover. By preparing the
data in advance, DEA reduces the cost and time involved in working with the vast
volumes of Earth observation data. This analysis-ready data (ARD) are made freely
available to users and will enable businesses to innovate and develop information
products and applications that can be applied to global challenges.

Product Development for Enhanced Access
DEA provides a suite of information products to the Australian government and
businesses. Table 21.1 provides a summary of key products and the following para-
graphs describe some of them in more detail (report extracts) to illustrate how, by
providing easy access to Earth observation data, DEA can help unlock innovation
and capability in government, industry, and the research community (DEA 2018). In
the future, there are many opportunities to include other data sets that may be in the
public or private domains, such as data collected by sensors installed in machines
used by farmers.
Severe ﬂoods are a feature of the Australian climate and landscape and are likely
to continue with increasing regularity and severity. Water Observations from Space
(WOfS) helps understand where ﬂooding may have occurred in the past, which allows
for mitigation measures to be considered for reducing future impacts, including
proper disaster planning and initiatives supporting communities’ preparedness and
disaster resilience. WOfS is also an invaluable information source for the Australian
Flood Risk Information Portal, which enables ﬂood information held by different
sources to be accessed from a single online location.
The fractional cover (FC) product can provide insights for land managers regard-
ing which parts of a property show heavier grazing. DEA is working with the Aus-
tralian Bureau of Statistics to explore whether this product can provide useful infor-
mation for land accounting and environmental reporting, and with the Clean Energy
RegulatortoincorporateFCintoitsmonitoringofEmissionsReductionFundprojects
and in potential future ground fraction products that may be of use to industry partners
such as FarmMap4D (FarmMap4D Spatial Hub 2018).
Changes in the NDVI over time can be used to identify areas where there has been
a sudden decrease or increase in the amount of vegetation. Sudden decreases in the
NDVI can be caused by a range of processes including tree clearing, cropping, or
severe bushﬁres. Sudden increases in the NDVI can result from vegetation responding
to increased water availability, crop growth, or greening of irrigated pasture.
The knowledge provided by products such as those highlighted in Table 21.1,
can contribute to a broad range of applications, including environmental monitoring
for migratory bird species, habitat mapping in coastal regions, hydrodynamic mod-
eling, and geomorphological studies of features in the intertidal zone. The surface
reﬂectance tool allows for a more accurate comparison of imagery captured at dif-
ferent times, by different sensors, in different seasons, and in different locations. It
also indicates where the image contains missing data, is affected by clouds or cloud
shadow, or has been affected in other ways.

Implementing Projects to Enhance Take-up
The DEA platform enables anyone, anywhere, to use the data to inform better
decision-making. The platform has the potential to contribute immediate and direct
economic beneﬁts to companies, organizations and individuals conducting feasibility
studies and assessments, evaluations, monitoring and management activities. A num-
ber of high-impact projects have used this platform, and GA aims to increase its use
by the wider community, including in regional and remote Australia. The spectrum
of Geoscience Australia’s current projects is illustrated in Table 21.2, synthesized
from the Geoscience Australia Road Map (GA 2018).
21.4
Australian Use Case Examples
In this section, we highlight several use cases spanning agriculture, education and
training, and disaster management, including initiatives within the capacity-building
work of the ISDE Australia chapter research node. For each use case, we highlight
the project objectives, lessons learned and opportunities going forward.

Agricultural Sector—FarmMap4D
The FarmMap4D (formerly known as the NRM Spatial Hub) property management
planning platform demonstrates how world-leading time-series remote sensing of
ground cover through an online interface can optimize grazing pressure and land
conditions, and allow for land managers to make better, more informed decisions.
Managers can use the product to view and overlay map layers and generate maps
and reports to support more effective land management and planning.
Thissinglesourceofinformationisaccessedbyprojectmanagers,contractors,and
property managers. The Hub combines the latest geospatial mapping technologies
with time-series satellite remote sensing of ground cover in a novel way. For the ﬁrst
time, the sheep and beef industries can use and compare their own data paddock
data with government data in a consistent and interactive way, as illustrated in the
screenshot of the interface in Fig. 21.6.
Russell-Smith and Sangha (2018) provide an overview of how FarmMap4D can
be used to consider emerging opportunities for developing a diversiﬁed land sector
economy in Australia’s northern savannas.

Education Sector—Research Group (ISDE Research
Node, Australia)
Grifﬁth University’s researchers (in Queensland) are working to connect digital-
spatial (‘place based’) design and decision-making enquiry for resilient and regen-
erative cities, building capacity to collectively address planning and governance for
future resilience in the face of unprecedented pressures (see Smith et al. 2010; Steffen
et al. 2011), including climate change, population dynamics and resource scarcity.
Building upon research and experience in sustainable development and engineering,
the researchers draw on a strong multidisciplinary research capacity and strengths in
educational pedagogy, rapid capacity building and education for sustainable devel-
opment. The group includes educational and behavioral psychology researchers,

industry-facing laboratory technical and management staff, and a growing team of
doctoral (PhD) candidates.
21.4.2.1
Capacity-Building System
The Cities Research Institute (CRI) is collaborating with the International Water
Centre (IWC) to create an innovative approach to capacity building for Digital Earth
products and services, building on the IWC’s success with the water modeling com-
munity in Queensland. With an aim of effectively disseminating Digital Earth knowl-
edge and the beneﬁts of use to the Australian professional community for business
development and growth, the team is developing a ‘Digital Earth Capacity System’
through which participants can learn about new and emerging capabilities of Digital
Earth globally and in Australia, as well as importance, relevance and applications,
as illustrated in Fig. 21.7.
Participants engage with Digital Earth experts on trends and opportunities for
Australian organizations and ‘learn from doing’ by working with Digital Earth Aus-
tralia data to assess problems over time. The courses also include case studies of real
examples of Digital Earth tools and applications that helped solve complex prob-
lems and enhance sustainability. It ranges from introductory courses to advanced
support. Building on the data that has been created, participants develop the capac-
ity to understand and use DEA data for applications including the development of
evidence-based policies and developing visual aids for strategic decision-making.

The expected beneﬁts for government collaborators include the following:
• Coursework being aligned with priority themes and focused on relevant topics
• Independent courses available to wider professional and public policy audiences
• Direct feedback from participants on the best ways to access and apply the tools
• Effective dissemination of knowledge and upskilling of the workforce to facilitate
enhanced use of the available high-quality data.
Potential learning outcomes for participants include the following:
• Live interaction via remote immersive collaboration
• Practice in visualizing, interpreting and communicating big data sets
• The ability to engage in professional development from remote locations
• Remote, always-available access to learning resources about using products.
21.4.2.2
Remote Immersive Collaboration Spaces—DENs
The same group of researchers are prototyping two unprecedented cost effective
and interactive “Digital Earth Node (DEN)” rooms, facilitating remote-immersive
collaboration where the data itself stays local to the users (utilising image rather than
data transfer) while collaboration occurs anywhere. In an increasingly connected
world, it is a challenge to create virtual meeting spaces to facilitate deep thinking
and decision-making that overcome the need to travel, where people can generate,
harvest, interpret and share data as though they were physically side by side.
In response to this challenge and in liaison with colleagues in the International
SocietyofDigitalEarth(ISDE),‘DigitalEarthNode’(DEN)engagementspaceshave
been designed to promote productive thinking and timely decision-making. The fol-
lowing paragraphs summarize the ‘preto-typing’ (i.e., conceptual) and ‘prototyping’
(i.e., pilot) undertaken to conceptualize, design and build the pilot facilities on two
Grifﬁth University campuses in Queensland, Australia, and connect them with other
702
Z. S. Mohamed-Ghouse et al.
facilities elsewhere (see also Desha et al. 2018). The achievements to date are high-
lighted with regard to building the potential for immersive thinking environments,
as well as next steps for future space development and reﬁnement.
Smart visualization and communication are critical components of any effort to
ensure that decision-makers have timely access to complex information and enable
holistic problem solving. This has been documented by authors such as Van Wijk
(2005) and the ISDE network (Goodchild 2010; Goodchild et al. 2012; Craglia et al.
2012; Roche 2014) and discussed within the geospatial and geo-design communities
by seminal speakers including Dangermond (2010), Benyus (2014) and Scott (2017).
Table 21.3 summarizes the key differences that the research team have deﬁned
to date in the Digital Earth Node (DEN) rooms and other regularly used interac-
tive video-conferencing tools and facilities. Essentially, the DEN rooms use readily
available hardware that is also used for video conferencing, including web cams,
audio feeds, touch screens and interactive technologies. However, a breakthrough in
software has resulted in the software ‘doing’ the heavy lifting, resulting in almost no
differences in the delay for the end-users and unprecedented ﬂexibility in the extent
of potential real-time editing and review.
A schematic of the room layouts is shown in Fig. 21.8. The individual room
designs are mirrored as closely as possible to provide the user with an ‘extended
room’ experience.

Looking ahead, society must transition towards multidisciplinary and multina-
tional approaches to address the planet’s increasingly complex challenges. This
requires a process change in collaboration around the world, without further impact-
ing greenhouse gas emissions from the collaboration (primarily through travel). Con-
sidering the Pivotal Principles for such problem solving in the 21st century referred
to in the Introduction to this chapter, the next logical step is to provide Digital Earth
Node (DEN) facilities around the world that create ‘remote but realistic’ personal
experiences between researchers and decision-makers to facilitate deep thinking and
problem solving.
Effortstowardsthisend-goalincludeusingtheprototypestoinformtheinstallation
of a Disaster and Resilience Management Facility (DRMF) within a new building on
Grifﬁth University’s Nathan Campus (Brisbane) by connecting the prototype DENs
with ISDE chapters internationally and focusing on two primary research agendas to
engage with the DEN rooms to explore how this technology and scientiﬁc knowledge
could be harnessed for human and ecological wellbeing:
• Green infrastructure: Using nature and learning from nature to inform the design
of resilient cities through analysis of geospatial data sets.
• Crisis communication in disaster management: using technologies to improve
response times to optimize the allocation of resources.
We anticipate that this network of global nodes will connect academics, leaders
and decision-makers around the globe in a fast, reliable and immersive manner. Col-
leagues around the world will be able to engage in pragmatic, real-time and rigorous
enquiry into challenges and opportunities facing humanity, with application oppor-
tunities spanning sectors including education, research, emergency services, crisis
management and global communication. This innovative network will be instrumen-
tal in developing spatial capabilities to catalyze human and planetary wellbeing. Such
precedents of the possibilities will have immediate implications for deep-thinking
engagement internationally and provide remote collaboration opportunities that are
engaging and better for the planet.
21.4.3
Disaster Management—NSW Volunteer Rescue
Association
With the reality that one minute can mean the difference between life and death, the
New South Wales Volunteer Rescue Association (NSW VRA) has been exploring
opportunities to make the most of existing ‘state of the shelf’ and emergent geospatial
technologies to improve outcomes with regard to what is anecdotally referred to as,
‘the right person and/or the right resources being in the right place, at the right
time’ (Desha and Perez-Mora 2018). This includes recognition that there may be
associated critical infrastructure disruption during disasters that makes rescue more
critical, including disabled communication networks, internet, and limited or no
access to power. Such circumstances require creative solutions to manage the timely
704
Z. S. Mohamed-Ghouse et al.
collation and exchange of conventionally ‘heavy’ data ﬁles such as video, photos,
location-based mapping assistance and real-time or near-real-time management of
large databases.
In 2017, the researchers were introduced to VRA personnel through the Grif-
ﬁth University EcoCentre. Inspired by the Digital Earth agenda and the work of
researchers including Van Wijk (2005), Craglia et al. (2012), and Goodchild et al.
(2012), they visited other researchers in Japan (Chubu University) and Europe (Joint
Research Centre) to experience precedents and discuss possibilities for improving
communication in disaster response.
Seekingasolutiontothesechallenges,theresearchersandtheirDigitalEarthNode
technical team have been working on developing software solutions to improve the
way hardware is used and leased, including engaging researchers in different areas to
generate better ways to use hardware in the form of a more efﬁcient communication
tool. In collaboration with the NSW VRA, data from a number of different sources
have been collated and analyzed, including the organization’s database and histori-
cal anecdotal and solicited feedback from members of the volunteer community of
professional volunteers and highly trained emergency management personnel. These
data were used to ground-truth potential software solutions, allowing for the team to
test solutions for improving the way personnel communicate in remote areas, how
personnel deploy information and how personnel manage others in times of need.
Following software development, the ﬁrst stage of deployment occurred in July
2018 when the team developed a software solution to improve the communication
between executive managers and key decision-making personnel and their squads
and squad members. This software now allows for the NSW VRA to collect data
while in the ﬁeld during a call out.
The data arising from deployment will be analyzed and processed to establish the
next stage of this complex project, the deployment of a DEN (Digital Earth Node)
remote immersive collaboration facility in regional NSW (Dubbo). This immersive
tool will allow for decision making personnel to locate units or key personal in the
ﬁeld while they are being deployed during challenging times such as ﬂoods and
bushﬁres. This will provide better ways to analyze what is happening in the ﬁeld and
aid in deployment of resources to the right locations at the right time. The system
will also be able to track activities in real-time and with accuracy to ensure the safety
of these professional volunteers.
The data will also be analyzed in an event block to enable a comprehensive report
at the end of each incident response. Drawing on the analysis of the data collected
by the DEN and devices in the ﬁeld, the NSW VRA will be able to generate precise
reports based on the human behaviors and decisions made. The ﬁndings will also
allow for the Association to understand how they should improve the way they train
their decision-making personnel and prevent mistakes during future events.
The research team is connecting with colleagues in international chapters of the
International Society of Digital Earth (ISDE) to ensure that best practices are shared
around the planet with other emergency management response teams. Thus, pro-
fessional international expertise to ﬁx unsolved or permanent challenges will reach
remote areas of Australia. Ultimately, everyone, everywhere should have access to a
21
Digital Earth in Australia
705
fully comprehensive system that allows for our ‘local heroes’ to save more lives and
provides them with the best safety approach during their high-risk activities.
21.5
Conclusions
This chapter highlighted achievements and opportunities for Australia considering
three decades of data capture and enquiry, from local and largely champion-based
ad hoc initiatives to mainstreamed integration and take-up globally. This included
an historical exploration of practices and experiences in Australia arising from the
need to manage local resources better, addressing the complexities of environmental
stewardship. With regard to data management and interfaces for meaningful end-user
engagement and enquiry, a number of initiatives stand out as exemplar projects for
potential adoption elsewhere.
Australian current and future priorities were summarized through a text analysis
of the Geoscience Australia roadmap, and two examples from the Australian ISDE
chapter highlight the imperative of enhancing end-user take up of the Digital Earth
technology through strategic capacity-building initiatives. The authors discussed the
mechanisms and challenges of harnessing interoperable information in the form of
geospatial data and through systems and processes to add value to the information.
Considering these experiences, the beneﬁts of open data and data sharing are realized
through careful planning, design and integration, with a focus on upfront iterative
design and end-user engagement. Releasing high-value data is an iterative process
that requires collaboration and communication with agencies to show the beneﬁts of
open data and to support useful data sharing.
Reﬂecting on the history and examples provided, several ‘turnkey’ capability
(workforce and market) considerations are summarized here for Australia’s future
and for non-Australians considering their own Digital Earth:
(1) Challenges in creating an active context for data use: Decision-makers and
researchers are currently grappling with how to harness the common repository
to create saleable products (apps and APIs), where analytics is a well-established
and supported opportunity for industry, beyond delivering funding for such
initiatives via government grants (i.e., teaching the people how to ﬁsh).
(2) Challenges in capacity building beyond ‘show-and-tell’: In a rapidly emergent
industry, it is critical to create the demand for products and services as well as
build the capacity to deliver these goods and services. Trust is paramount in
this process and must be prioritized when governments test and pilot products
and services. There is a need for industry buy-in and for industry investors.
In Australia, there is currently no public-private-partner (PPP) model in data
adoption beyond advocating for industry to ‘look how good the tool is.’
(3) Challenges in deﬁning the job market and demand for the market: In a country
where the number of geospatial professionals is insufﬁcient, capacity building is
critical and must be addressed urgently (FrontierSI 2018). This includes public
706
Z. S. Mohamed-Ghouse et al.
and private sector considerations with regard to the types of skills required and
the need for a capacity-building framework to aid in data utilization. We need
to ﬁnd demand for the market, potentially through the development of an active
‘Community of Practice’ across different key sectors, to enable more serious
business workﬂow integration around technology, for example, for farm and
water management.
In addition, several considerations relating to efforts and investments made on
data and technologies are summarized:
(1) Considering open source versus business continuity: The initial version of the
Queensland Globe was created using a Google open source platform, then could
nolongerbesupportedbyGoogle.IttooktimefortheQueenslandgovernmentto
ﬁnd a reliable partner and Esri (proprietary software) was chosen to support the
continuity of the project. In hindsight, a hybrid approach could take advantage
of open source and proprietary platforms.
2)
Sharing knowledge within the context of an open source platform: Despite
progress, most end-users—whether government, business or citizens—do not
have the knowledge and/or skills to ﬁnd, download and use open data directly.
This Digital Earth platform relies on a number of technologies and, although
the code developed is open source, there is no community of practice to enable
or coordinate technical expertise. Hence, coordination and capacity building are
needed to help practitioners access and work with the data.
3)
Measuring the success of Digital Earth products: This chapter provided
numerous examples of products and the utilization of such products must be
evaluated beyond the initial excitement and celebration of their existence. Ways
to measure utilization are being explored, including conducting economic ben-
eﬁt analyses. Such metadata about utility is important to demonstrate value and
ensure continued maintenance and updating of the Digital Earth Platform to
meet the future needs of the community.
4)
Enabling access and utility remotely: In a globally connected world, remote
immersive collaboration has the potential to create communities of practice with
reduced cost of travel and greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to ensuring data
security in discussions and collaboration. This is particularly important when
governments internationally are interested in using Australia’s Digital Earth
platforms to communicate decisions, upgrade infrastructure, and oversee the
safety and wellbeing of citizens.

for sharing, privacy security protection, personnel training and other areas. China
also attaches great importance to the development of Digital Earth. In 1999, the ﬁrst
Digital Earth Symposium was held in Beijing, which began Digital Earth research
all over China. In 2006, the Chinese National Committee of the International Soci-
ety for Digital Earth (CNISDE) was established. As the national member of the
ISDE, the CNISDE promotes the ISDE’s ideals for national acceptance. Since 2006,
Digital Earth has experienced high-speed development in China. Focusing on the
development of Digital Earth in China caters to and promotes information technol-
ogy development and acts as an endogenous driving force to promote economic
transformation and upgrading as well as sustainable development.
22.2
China’s Digital Earth Strategy and Policy
In recent years, the Chinese government has attached great importance to infor-
mation technology development, especially for Digital Earth technologies. It has
strengthened the top-level design and overall layout and made a strategic decision
on building Digital Earth in China. Digital Earth is a new strategy for information
technology development in the new era, a new measure to meet the people’s growing
demands for a better life, and a new driving force leading high-quality economic
development. Digital Earth in China covers information technology construction in
various ﬁelds such as the economy, politics, culture, society and ecology. In his con-
gratulatory letter to the ﬁrst Digital China Summit held in April 2018, President Xi
Jinping noted that the information technology innovation in today’s world is chang-
ing with each passing day, and in-depth development of digitalization, networking
and intelligence plays an increasingly important role in promoting economic and
social development, modernizing the state’s governance systems and capabilities,
and meeting the people’s growing demands for a better life.
As Digital Earth development in China enters a peak period, the digital economy
will also naturally add momentum to China’s economic development. To speed up
the development of Digital Earth in China, China will continue to improve the policy
environment by formulating and introducing a series of policy documents on the
development of Digital Earth in China. Information technology has become a major
force for the government to serve the people and adds new momentum for economic
development. The development of Digital Earth in China has brought changes to
people’s daily lives and the production of enterprises.

22.2.1
National Macro Strategic Plans for Digital Earth
in China
In recent years, relevant departments in China have successively issued major strate-
gic plans for national information technology development to indicate a road map
and timetable for the development of Digital Earth in China and clarify that the gen-
eral goal of Digital Earth development in the new era is to adhere to and achieve the
synchronous promotion of the “Two hundred-years Goals” to fully support the devel-
opment of the causes of the country, to promote balanced, tolerant and sustainable
economic and social development and to provide solid support for the modernization
of the national governance systems and capacities. The development plans note that
China must adhere to people-centered development thinking and take the improve-
ment of the people’s well-being as the starting point and foothold for the development
of Digital Earth in China, to better beneﬁt the people. The three strategic tasks of
Digital Earth in China are to greatly enhance the ability of information technology
development, focus on improving the level of information technology development
in economic and social ﬁelds and continuously optimize the environment for infor-
mation technology development.
(1) “Broadband China” Strategy. On August 17, 2013, the government of China
issued the “Broadband China” strategy implementation plan and deployed the broad-
band development goals and paths for the next 8 years, meaning that the “Broadband
Strategy” went from a departmental action to a national strategy, and broadband
became the national strategic public infrastructure for the ﬁrst time. By 2020, China
aims to ﬁnish the construction of a high-speed and smooth broadband network infras-
tructure with advanced technology to cover urban and rural areas and offer convenient
services.
(2) Outline of the National Information Technology Development Strategy. The
outline is a regulation formulated to promote modernization through information
technology development and to build network power. The outline stipulates that,
by 2020, the core key technologies will reach the international advanced level, the
international competitiveness of the information industry will be greatly improved,
the digitalization, networking and intelligence will make signiﬁcant progress in key
industries, the networked collaborative innovation system will be fully formed, e-
government affairs will ﬁrmly support the modernization of national governance sys-
tems and capacities, and information technology development will become a leading
force driving the modernization construction (The State Council 2016). The internet
bandwidth for international export will reach 20 Tbps to support the implementation
of the “Belt and Road” initiative and achieve network and information connection
with neighboring countries. The China-ASEAN Information Port will be built and
the online Silk Road will be established to signiﬁcantly improve the international
competitiveness of information and communication technologies and products and
internet services.
(3) “Thirteenth Five-Year” National Information Technology Development
Plan. Aiming to implement the Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan and the
716
J. Bi et al.
Outline of the National Information Technology Development Strategy, the plan is
an important part of the “Thirteenth Five-year” national planning system and an
action guide for information development work in various regions and departments
during the “Thirteenth Five-year.” It was issued and implemented by the govern-
ment of China on December 15, 2016. The plan noted that by 2020, “Digital Earth”
development will achieve remarkable results, the level of information technology
development will rise sharply, the information capability will rank among the top
in the world, and the information industry ecosystem with international competi-
tiveness and security under control will be in place. Information technology and
economic and social development will be deeply integrated, the digital gap will be
signiﬁcantly narrowed and the digital dividend will be fully released. Information
technology development will fully support the causes of the government and the
country, promote balanced, tolerant and sustainable economic and social develop-
ment and provide solid support for the modernization of the national governance
systems and capacities (Gov.cn 2016).
(4) Big Data Strategy. Data are basic national strategic resources. China attaches
great importance to the role of big data in economic and social development. The
government proposed the “implementation of the national big data strategy” and the
issued the Outline for Actions Promoting Big Data Development to fully promote
big data development and accelerate data development to strengthen the state. The
Big Data Industry Development Plan (2016–2020) was also formulated, proposing
that the income from big data-related products and services will exceed RMB 1
trillion by 2020, with an average annual compound growth rate of approximately
30%; 10 internationally leading core enterprises in the industry of big data will be
cultivated; 10–15 comprehensive big data pilot areas will be built; and 1–2 open
source communities with standardized operation and an international inﬂuence will
be established.
(5) Network Power Strategy. The network power strategy includes three aspects,
namely, network infrastructure construction, new development of the information
and communication industry and network information security (Chen 2016). The
proposal for the “Thirteenth Five-Year” Plan approved by the government proposed
implementation of the network power strategy and the closely related “internet +”
action plan. Accelerating the network power strategy has a direct effect in improving
China’s international competitiveness and contributes to the economic and techno-
logical development and transformation of China.
22.2.2
Policies and Plans for Development of Digital Earth
in China
(1) White Paper on China’s Digital Economy Development (2017). On July 13,
2017, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology released
the White Paper on China’s Digital Economy Development (2017) at the 16th China
22
Digital Earth in China
717
Internet Conference. The white paper noted that, in the next few years, China will
deploy 5G, next-generation internet, the Internet of Things (IoT), industrial internet
and other technologies on a large scale. With the construction of various network
infrastructures and the application of related technologies, development of Digital
Earth in China will enter a peak period. It will lay the foundation for development
of the digital economy, industrial transformation and upgrading, and the integrated
development of various industries in China (China Academy of Information and
Communications Technology 2017).
(2) Action Plan for Promoting Large-Scale Deployment of Internet Protocol
Version 6 (IPv6). On November 26, 2017, the government issued the Action Plan for
Promoting Large-scale Deployment of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), proposing
that in the next ﬁve to ten years, China will form a next-generation internet inde-
pendent technology system and an industrial ecology, build the world’s largest IPv6
commercial application network, realize deep integration and application of next-
generation internet in various economic and social ﬁelds, and become an important
leading force in development of the world’s next-generation internet.
(3) “Internet +” Action Plan. The development of the plan was led by the
National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology. China introduced and is still developing a series of policies
for promoting innovative development of information technology and e-commerce.
In the government work report on the two sessions in 2015, Premier Li Keqiang
proposed the requirement of “developing an internet + action plan” to promote
the integration of mobile internet, cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of
Things with modern manufacturing and the sound development of e-commerce,
industrial internet and internet ﬁnance as well as to guide internet companies to
expand the international market (Ning 2015). Representing a new economic form,
“internet +” supports industrial intelligence, enhances the momentum of new eco-
nomic development and promotes improvements in quality and efﬁciency and the
upgrading of the national economy.
(4) Three-Year Action Plan for Cloud Computing Development (2017–2019).
In April 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology developed and
issued the Three-Year Action Plan for Cloud Computing Development (2017–2019).
The targets of the plan are for China’s cloud computing industry to reach a worth
of RMB 430 billion, make breakthroughs in a number of core technologies, achieve
cloud computing service capability at an international advanced level and signiﬁ-
cantly drive the development of the new-generation information industry. The inter-
national inﬂuence of cloud computing enterprises will be signiﬁcantly improved and
two or three leading enterprises with a large share in the global cloud computing
market will emerge. The capability of guaranteeing cloud computing network secu-
rity will be signiﬁcantly improved, and the network security supervision systems and
laws and regulation systems will be gradually improved (The Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology 2017).
(5) “Thirteenth Five-Year” Special Plan for Scientiﬁc and Technological Inno-
vation in the Information Sector. The special plan formulated the implementation
plan for “Scientiﬁc and Technological Innovation 2030—Major Projects” and started
718

the implementation of major new-generation artiﬁcial intelligence projects (Gov.cn
2017). It steadily promoted major projects such as the space-terrestrial integrated
information network and big data and launched the IoT and smart city initiatives,
broadband communications, new types of networks and other key projects (The State
Council 2015). Chinawill acceleratetheimplementationof theOutlinefor Promoting

22.3
Infrastructure for Digital Earth in China
The development of Digital Earth in China is inseparable from the support of network
and information technology. The development of the entire infrastructure and related
digital technologies is of great signiﬁcance to the development of Digital Earth in
China.
Currently, relevant new technologies, such as 5G, IPV6, cloud computing, big
data and artiﬁcial intelligence, are continuously being applied in the infrastructure of
Digital Earth in China. Related technologies including artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud
computing, big data, and blockchain are also developing rapidly. China has intro-
duced many new related policies, and many industrial alliances have been formed
to add new impetus to Digital Earth in China. The infrastructure construction mani-
fested as follows:
(1) Deployment of New-Generation Information Network Technology. 5G net-
work technology has made important breakthroughs in R&D, testing and veriﬁca-
tion (Fig. 22.1). In the implementation of the national major science and technology
project “new-generation broadband wireless mobile communication network,” the
design and R&D of a 3Gsps 12-bit ADC/DAC, PA, a wide-area hot-spot baseband
chip and a low-delay baseband chip was completed, and the R&D of key technolo-
gies such as the 5G core network and ultradense networking based on SDN/NFV is
being advanced. 5G R&D and testing work is advancing rapidly; the ﬁrst batch of
speciﬁcations for the third phase of testing has been released and the development of
the global uniﬁed 5G standard is being promoted. The bearing and capacities of the
radio and television networks have been improved. The two-way access strategy for
radio and television and telecommunications services is being promoted throughout
the country. The second stage of an experimental pilot of the cable, wireless and satel-
lite integration network for radio and television is being advanced at a faster speed,
and the experimental technology solution and establishment of three standards for
the integration network in 11 provinces have been approved. The number of China’s
IPTV users has reached 122 million. IPv6 is evolving comprehensively and being
upgraded at a faster speed. The implementation of the Action Plan for Promoting
22
Digital Earth in China

Large-scale Deployment of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) accelerated the con-
struction of next-generation internet with high speed, wide popularity, full coverage
and intelligence.
(2) InnovativeConstructionof CloudComputingInfrastructure. Theimplemen-
tation of Opinions on Promoting Innovative Development of Cloud Computing and
Cultivating a New Format of the Information Industry and the Three-Year Action
Plan for Cloud Computing Development (2017–2019) in China has promoted the
popularization of cloud computing applications, optimized the layout of cloud com-
puting data centers, enhanced the usage rate and intensiﬁcation level, and formed
an industrial system with international competitiveness. Breakthroughs have been
made in key technologies such as large-scale concurrent processing, massive data
storage, and data center energy conservation. Cloud computing platforms with inter-
national competitiveness have emerged, such as Alicloud’s Apsara platform, Baidu
Brain and the WeChat open technology platform. In 2016, the proportion of large
and ultralarge data centers increased to 25% from less than 8% in 2010. There are
295 enterprises with large data centers and cross-regional internet data services. The
Internet of Things has been deeply integrated, and the pace of generic application has
been sped up. The R&D and deployment of NB-IoT are being sped up, and China
Telecom has built the world’s ﬁrst commercial NB-IoT network with the widest cov-
erage and synchronous upgrading of the entire network of 310,000 base stations. The
NB-IoT technology solution proposed by Huawei has been approved by 3GPP and
become an international standard. The NB-IoT is being expanded to public facili-
ties management, production and life at a faster speed to accelerate the intelligent
transformation of power grids, railways, highways and other infrastructure.
(3) Localization of the GIS Platform. During the development of Digital Earth
in China, geographic information systems (GIS) have played a very important role
in promoting Digital Earth in China. After 30 years of hard work, China’s GIS
720
J. Bi et al.
technology has made remarkable achievements. In the early stage of Digital Earth
development, it was mainly based on two-dimensional visualization applications and
lacked three-dimensional analysis capabilities. In response to the demand of Digital
Earth in China, China has proposed and developed GIS technology that integrates
two and three dimensions to gradually form the GIS software covering data mod-
els, scene modeling, spatial analysis and two- and three-dimensional software forms.
With the development of data acquisition technology, Digital Earth in China has inte-
grated traditional 3D modeling, oblique photography, laser-point clouds, BIM and
other three-dimensional technologies based on two- and three-dimension integration
technology to develop the new-generation three-dimensional GIS technology, which
has realized three-dimensional modeling of multisource heterogeneous data, object-
level 3D spatial analysis and visualization of nonvisual information, extending the
research scope of Digital Earth in China from the Earth’s surface to the entire space.
Three-dimensional spatial data speciﬁcations have been formed to solve the sharing
and interoperability problems inherent in such heterogeneous data in applications to
bring real and convenient 3D experience to digital applications. Cloud GIS technol-
ogy and cloud computing have greatly improved the data resources and computing
resource capabilities of Digital Earth in China and expanded its range of applications.
Cloud GIS technology has realized the interconnection and intercommunication of
information and functions between cloud GIS (servers) and various terminal GIS
(desktop GIS, mobile GIS, WebGIS), making applications and services ubiquitous.
A client (such as WebGL) that is as thin as possible can also be used advantageously
in cloud computing to reduce the client installation and maintenance costs in digital
applications. As a result, the network-based intergovernmental and interdepartmental
collaborative development of the “Digital Belt and Road” will be promoted.
As the “GIS core” for software platform construction in Digital Earth infrastruc-
ture, China’s GIS basic software represented by SuperMap GIS has played a unique
role. Through multisource heterogeneous data integration, it integrates, shares, ana-
lyzes, manages and mines data, and ultimately serves global change research, disaster
reduction and prevention, new energy development, new urbanization, and agricul-
tural food safety to aid in the development of Digital Earth in China.
(4) The Big Data Platform. Big data has begun to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence
global production, circulation, distribution, and consumption patterns. It is changing
humankind’s production methods, lifestyles, mechanisms of economic operation,
and country governance models. Big data occupies strategic high ground in the era
of knowledge-driven economies, and it is a new strategic resource for all nations
(Guo 2017).
In an initiative led by Guo Huadong, president of the Committee on Data for Sci-
ence and Technology (CODATA) of the International Council for Science (ICSU),
CODATA has worked with other international science organizations and initiatives to
explore the value of big data in scientiﬁc research and to reinforce the crucial role of
science in the development of big data. After the June 2014 “International Workshop
on Big Data for International Scientiﬁc Programmes: Challenges and Opportunities”
sponsored by CODATA in Beijing and cosponsored by the ICSU World Data Sys-
tem, Future Earth, Integrated Research on Disaster Risk, the Research Data Alliance,
22
Digital Earth in China
721
the Group on Earth Observations, the International Society for Digital Earth, and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth,
CODATA and others developed a joint statement of recommendations and actions
[6]. This statement emphasized providing a better understanding of big data for sci-
entiﬁc research, and strengthening international science for the beneﬁt of society
by developing research, policies, and frameworks related to big data. Since then,
a series of meetings on big data for science has been organized or coorganized by
Guo’s research team. These have included the “Xiangshan Science Conference on
Frontiers of Scientiﬁc Big Data,” “The Academic Divisions of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences Forum on Frontiers of Science and Technology for Big Earth Data from
Space,” and the “Exploratory Round Table Conference on Big Data in Natural Sci-
ences, Humanities and Social Sciences.” It is our opinion that scientiﬁc big data will
play a key role in promoting scientiﬁc development (Guo 2017).
22.4
China’s Experience in the Development of Digital
Provinces and Cities
Digital cities refer to the use of spatial information to build a virtual platform that
acquires and loads information such as that on natural resources, social resources,
infrastructure, culture, and economics of provincial units or city units in the digital
form to provide a wide range of services for governmental and social users to improve
city management efﬁciency, save resources and promote the sustainable development
of cities.
22.4.1
Digital Fujian
In2000,whenPresidentXiJinpingwasinthepositionofgovernorofFujianProvince,
China, he initiated the “Digital Fujian” project. He clariﬁed the development con-
notation and development mode of “Digital Fujian” and proposed the development
goal of being “digital, networked, visualized and intelligent.” In 2001, the “Digital
Fujian” Plan was launched, including one plan (“Digital Fujian” Tenth Five-Year
Plan), three projects (Fujian Public Information Platform, Fujian Government Infor-
mation Network Project and Spatial Information Research Center of Fujian) and one
policy (Fujian information sharing policy). Fujian began to build three basic support-
ive platforms: a uniﬁed government affairs network, an information exchange system
and an information security system to realize facilities sharing, platform sharing and
data sharing, which established the overall framework of “Digital Fujian.” Over the
past 18 years, “Digital Fujian” has drawn up four ﬁve-year special plans using the
top-level design as the guiding ideology for the overall coordination and planning
of the information technology development of the whole province, to ensure that
722
J. Bi et al.
the construction of “Digital Fujian” moves forward in a phased, focused and orderly
manner.
With the top-level design plan and long-term plans as guides, Fujian Province has
advanced the construction of “Digital Fujian” in an orderly manner through the devel-
opment goals, frameworks, mechanisms and development ideas that were determined
intheinitialyears.Theconstructionof“DigitalFujian”isclosetopeople’slivelihood,
enterprises and society. The e-government practice of “Digital Fujian” comprises the
joint development and sharing of data in all government systems, acceleration of the
digital upgrading of tourism, transportation, taxation, medical treatment, education
systems and other areas of people’s livelihood, and reducing the “multiple leader-
ship” in e-government. The new ideology makes “Digital Fujian” a new model that
beneﬁts the people. By 2020, the digital economy of Fujian will exceed RMB 400
billion with an annual growth rate of over 20% and a proportion of over 45% of the
GDP, forming a development pattern with advanced digital infrastructure, efﬁcient
e-government collaboration, integrated and innovative digital economy and a secure,
independent and controllable network and information, realizing the goal of being
“digital, networking and intelligent.” Fujian will actively promote the establishment
of the Digital Earth Core Technology Industry Alliance, add to “Belt and Road”
digital economy development funds and Digital Earth development funds, speed up
the construction of a number of new smart city platform projects, strengthen organi-
zational leadership, and optimize the development environment.
22.4.2
Digital Hong Kong and Digital Macao
The construction of Digital Earth has penetrated China’s economy, society, and peo-
ple’s lives and has resulted in remarkable achievements in improving government
management, promoting industrial development and serving people, especially the
construction of Digital Hong Kong and Macao.
(1) Development History: The government has been the main promoter of dig-
ital city construction and actively supports the digital development of cities. Since
1990, the Hong Kong government has spent 6 years establishing the ﬁrst large land
information system using geographic information systems (GIS) technology in Hong
Kong and successfully applied it to land usage, cadastral maps and town plans. In
2009, the Hong Kong Transport Department launched a transport information sys-
tem based on a central database, which provides four major services: a road trafﬁc
information service, Hong Kong eRouting, Hong Kong eTransport and an intelligent
road network. In addition, the Hong Kong Lands Department is actively expanding
smart city infrastructure and environmental detection applications based on mobile
measuring vehicles.
In 2000, the government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) ofﬁ-
cially launched an environment geographic information system, which was jointly
22
Digital Earth in China
723
developed by the Cartography and Cadastre Bureau and Macao Environmental Pro-
tection Bureau (DSPA). The system draws a mathematical model to study the envi-
ronmental conditions and perform evaluations through the comprehensive collection
and analysis of existing and new environmental data in Macao, providing services for
the urban environment quality evaluation, natural resources analysis, city planning,
emergency warning systems and disaster assessment. In addition, to facilitate citi-
zens’ access to information on historical urban areas and cultural property reserves,
the Macao Cartography and Cadastre Bureau launched the local Cadastral Informa-
tion Network to include historical heritage and cultural conservation information,
contributing to the protection of Macao’s historical, cultural and architectural prop-
erty.
(2) Preliminary Results: At present, the construction of Digital Hong Kong and
Macao has resulted in many achievements, covering disaster monitoring, urban con-
struction, residents’ lives, government management and other aspects.
On August 4, 2017, the Macao SAR signed the Framework Agreement on Strate-
gic Cooperation in the Construction of a Smart City with the Alibaba Group. The
government of Macao SAR will make full use of Alibaba’s relevant leading tech-
nological capabilities, such as cloud computing and the application of big data, to
promote the pace of the construction of a smart Macao, to widen the context of the
SAR data, improve the modes of economic and social operation, and promote the
development of the smart city. In the long term, Macao will be developed into a
smart city that is “leading technology by digital development and serving people’s
livelihood with intelligence.”
The construction of Digital Hong Kong and Macao show a good trend of “con-
necting every place and everything, handling everything on internet, and innovating
every business.” With the advances in technologies including cloud computing, big
data, and the IoT, the deepening cooperation between the government and high-tech
companies, the integrated development of different smart platforms, and the contin-
uous improvement of the strategic guarantee system for integrated ground and air
information technology, Digital Hong Kong and Macao will develop further and play
a more important role in promoting urban economic development and improving the
quality of life of urban residents.
22.5
Development of Digital Earth Applications in China
The wide application of Digital Earth technology has resulted in signiﬁcant and
far-reaching impacts on various economic and social areas in China. With the devel-
opment of LiDAR, microwave and multispectral remote sensing technologies, great
progress has been made in Digital Earth applications in China. The applications can
be summarized in three aspects.
724
J. Bi et al.
22.5.1
Digitalization: Drawing and Depicting China
To “Draw and Depict China with Digital Earth Technology” means to use digital
technology to summarize and present the phenomena and laws that exist but are
difﬁcult to ﬁnd using traditional administrative and technical means. Regardless of
whether digital technology is used or not, these phenomena or laws exist objectively,
but it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd or describe them without digital technology.
(1) Big Earth Data for Digital Earth. “Big Earth data” is a fundamental aspect
for Digital Earth. Big Earth data, including the huge datasets derived from satel-
lite observations, ground sensor networks, and other sources, are characterized
as being massive, multisource, heterogeneous, multitemporal, multiscale, high-
dimensional, highly complex, nonstationary and unstructured. It provides support
for data-intensive research in the Earth sciences (Guo 2017).
As an example, global change research demands the systematization of the Earth
and comprehensive observations and has led to the rapid development of ground
observation technology. Modern Earth science requires globally established, quasi-
real time, all-weather Earth data acquisition capabilities and has developed an inte-
grated space-air-ground observation system with high spatial, temporal, and spectral
resolutions. Global change research focuses on global sustainable development and
deals with key multidisciplinary challenges, including global change process moni-
toring, simulation analysis, and response strategies. These studies rely on big Earth
data such as long-term, multispatiotemporal Earth observation data, accurate, con-
tinuous ground station observation data, and experimental data based on theoretical
speculation and estimations. Therefore, big Earth data can provide a new approach to
the development of global change research. As a tool in cross-disciplinary research,
big Earth data has the potential to provide a virtual Earth that can be used in the Earth
sciences and has close relations to information science, space science, technology,
the humanities, and the social sciences. Generally, big Earth data include the main
features of big data.
(2) Digital Agriculture. “Digital agriculture” refers to intensive and information-
based agricultural technologies supported by geoscience space and information tech-
nology. As an important symbol of agriculture in the 21st century, the development
of “digital agriculture” and related technologies is an inevitable choice to support
the development of modern agriculture in China.
One of the outstanding manifestations of the applications of information technol-
ogy is the application of the Digital Earth platform in the ﬁeld of digital agriculture,
in breeding, crop growth, farmland management, and agricultural information (Meng
et al. 2011). With the rapid development of Earth observation technology, research
on and application of “digital agriculture” has been gradually deepened, providing
more diversiﬁed information for digital agriculture and promoting the comprehen-
sive development of agricultural information technology (Li 1992). In China, Digital
Earth technology is widely applied in the acquisition of farmland plot information,
agricultural measures, farmland environments and other information and has been
successfully applied to monitor crop growth, soil moisture, crop water stress, crop
22
Digital Earth in China
725
nutrients, and crop disasters and in the estimation of the per unit yield of crops
and agricultural irrigation guidance. Digital agriculture plays an important role in
Chinese food security (Wu 2004).
22.5.2
Digitalization to Make China Different
“Digitalization to make China different” refers to a series of changes in the way that
society operates and how people live through the extensive use of digital technology.
“Digital Earth in China” has gradually led to revolutionary changes in people’s daily
behaviors and communication methods, allowing for people to enjoy the digital
dividend.
(1) Disaster Monitoring and Prevention. Digital disaster reduction technology
has integrated the advantages of remote sensing, GIS, navigation systems, mobile
terminals, and the internet and other technologies to comprehensively acquire and
analyze disaster information. Compared with the traditional observation methods,
the rapid, accurate and macro acquisition of information by digital disaster reduction
technology using Earth observation technology, which is its core constituent tech-
nology, has played an irreplaceable role due to its all-weather, all-day, multiangle
and highly efﬁcient performance.
At present, digital disaster reduction research has abundant aerospace observation
data sources, but there is an urgent need to develop the ability to quickly identify
knowledge and obtain effective disaster information from massive data. With the
advent of the era of big data, cutting-edge disaster reduction technology supported
by big Earth data has brought new opportunities for the development of China’s
research on digital disaster reduction. It is expected to make breakthroughs in the
bottleneck problem of open data for sharing. By integrating remote sensing satellite
data, aviation monitoring data, navigation positioning data, ground survey data and
social statistics data, integrated analysis of interdisciplinary and multitype disaster
reduction data can be accomplished through the big Earth data platform to reduce
the time cost of carrying out collaborative analyses of disasters based on multisource
data and improve the ability to rapidly mine disaster information.
(2) Monitoring and Protection of Natural and Cultural Heritage. Digital her-
itage refers to the applications of digital technology with spatial information tech-
nology as the core in the ﬁelds of cognition, protection and utilization of cultural
and natural heritage. The applications of remote sensing, GIS, modern measurement
technology and VR technology in the ﬁelds of heritage discovery, protection, dis-
play and utilization are the key endeavors. Entering the 21st century, digital heritage
has entered a fast lane. Relevant national projects are being carried out one after
another, such as the national project on exploring the origin of Chinese civilization
and monitoring of the Chinese Grand Canal and Great Wall. In 2016, Guo Huadong
established a “Protection and Development of Natural and Cultural Heritage Along
the Belt and Road” project in the Digital Belt and Road (DBAR) research initiative.
In 2017, a research team led by Bi Jiantao went deep into the Angkor Wat and Preah
726
J. Bi et al.
Vihear temples in Cambodia to implement the monitoring and protection of natural
and cultural heritage and realized the acquisition and modeling of centimeter-level
3D architectural cultural heritage data in a country along the Belt and Road for the
ﬁrst time. In 2018, a research team led by Wang Xinyuan found 10 archaeological
sites of ancient Rome in Tunisia. The continuous implementation of these projects
marks the beginning of a new development stage of digital heritage research.
(3) Applications in the Digital Mountain Field. As a scientiﬁc subset and appli-
cation example of Digital Earth, digital mountain research is the uniﬁcation of spatial
information methods and tools for mountain science research and integrated moun-
tain management. It provides reliable basic data, analyzes solutions and simulates
lab environments for mountain research through the integration of data, models, and
analytical methods. Recently, a new phase of progress has begun in ﬁelds such as
mountain cover mapping, digital terrain analysis and digital watershed construction.
The development of the digital mountain observation and experiment platform needs
to comprehensively consider the terrain gradient, vegetation gradient and multiscale
nested observation methods to build a ground-air-space three-dimensional observa-
tion system with the help of UAV remote sensing platforms, to obtain multisource
and multiscale surface observation data sets to support breakthroughs in mountain
remote sensing theory and application research on digital mountain science.
(4) Research and Education. Since the beginning of this century, China has estab-
lished institutes, national and provincial key laboratories, and companies relevant to
Digital Earth and Digital China. These include the Institute of Digital China, Peking
University (IDC-PKU), founded in 2004, and the Beijing Key Laboratory of Envi-
ronmental Remote Sensing and Digital City, founded in 2002. China has also hosted
symposiums, summits, and workshops to discuss topics relevant to Digital Earth and
Digital China, such as the Digital China Forum organized by PKU held annually
from 2004 to 2018.
China has developed Digital Earth-related education activities for undergraduate
students, graduate students and teenagers. Universities offer courses covering Digital
Earth and Digital Cities, such as ‘Introduction of Digital Earth’ at Peking University
(PKU) and ‘GIS and Digital Earth’ at Zhejiang University. Institutions and uni-
versities also offer large public science popularization activities for Digital Earth.
For example, the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI) has ‘Poster
Walls’ to show the development of Digital Earth technologies in China; the China
Association for Science and Technology (CAST) and PKU host the annual ‘BeiDou
Cup’ Youth Science Creation Competition to award achievements in the ‘BeiDou
Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and Digital China’ ﬁeld. Textbooks about Dig-
ital Earth have been published by professors from universities since the 1990s, and
a variety of popular science books have been published since the beginning of the
2000s.
(5) Digital Geographical Names. The public service project regarding geograph-
ical names includes four tasks: geographical name speciﬁcation, geographical name
marks, a geographical names plan and digital geographical names. The digital
geographical names project comprises the informatization of geographical name
services. The construction of geographical name information services can further
22
Digital Earth in China
727
enhance the scientiﬁc and standardization level of geographical name management
and achieve multidata collection. The rational use of these data and the development
of various geographical name information services will transform such resources
into enormous social and economic beneﬁts. Digital geographical name technology
makes full use of electronic maps, remote sensing images and other technical means
in the ﬁeld of Digital Earth and expands the use of the internet, big data and other
technical methods to achieve the combination of geographical name information,
map imagery, geographical name query and statistical analysis.
Relying on the geographical name database, telecommunications technology, the
internet and other media will be used for a geographical name informatization service
via a toponymic website, toponymic hotline, toponymic disc (electronic map), and a
toponymic touch screen as the main contents to realize the sharing of geographical
name information with all of society. The public can obtain accurate geographical
name information quickly, conveniently and in a timely manner.
22.5.3
Digitalization to Drive and Promote China’s
Development
“Digital Earth to drive and promote China’s development” means the essential
improvementofproductionmodes,productionefﬁciencyandproductqualitybrought
by the application of digital technology in the ﬁeld of spatial information technology.
In addition to the extensive application of digital technology in auxiliary aspects such
as R&D, management, marketing, warehousing and logistics, an increasing number
of technologies such as the IoT, artiﬁcial intelligence, industrial internet and indus-
trial robots have been directly introduced into production to enable improvements in
the production of enterprises and to provide a solid foundation to guarantee person-
alized customization and intelligent manufacturing. Currently, China is vigorously
promoting “Made in China 2025” and “building a manufacturing power.” This is a
key direction of research and promotion of the ISDE Chinese National Committee
to study how to strengthen the role of digital technology in the process.
(1) Digital New Technologies, New Industries, New Formats and New Models
Are Constantly Emerging. In 2017, China’s digital economy reached RMB 27.2
trillion, showing a yearly growth of 20.3% and accounting for 32.9% of the GDP, and
became an important engine to drive economic transformation and upgrading. The
electronic information manufacturing industry, software and information services
industry and communications industry continued to develop rapidly. In 2017, the
information industry had a revenue of RMB 22.1 trillion, showing a yearly growth
of 14.5%. In 2017, China’s information consumption increased to RMB 4.5 trillion,
a yearly growth of 15.4%, which was approximately twice the growth rate of ﬁnal
consumption during the same period. It accounted for 10% of ﬁnal consumption
and contributed more than 0.4% to GDP growth. The overall strength and global
competitiveness of the network and information technology enterprises in China
728
J. Bi et al.
Fig. 22.2 GIS software market share in China (2015)
have been continuously improved (see Fig. 22.2), and seven internet enterprises rank
among the top 20 in the world in terms of their market values.
(2) Digital Information Technology Promotes Changes in the Quality, Efﬁ-
ciency and Power of Economic Development. The Guiding Opinions on Deepen-
ing the Integrated Development of the Manufacturing Industry and Internet and the
Guiding Opinions on Deepening “Internet + the Advanced Manufacturing Industry
and Developing Industrial Internet” have been implemented to promote the in-depth
integrated development of the manufacturing industry and the internet. The imple-
mentation has been deﬁned by software, driven by data, supported by platforms,
added value to services and led by intelligence (Figs. 22.3 and 22.4). With the rapid
development of industrial internet, a number of industrial applications for complex
products such as high-speed trains and wind power have been developed and initially
achieved commercialized applications. The pace of rural and agricultural information
technology has been obviously sped up by fully implementing the project to deliver
information into villages and households and offer services for the convenience of
233 million people. A number of demonstration templates for digital agriculture
have been created to continuously improve intelligent agricultural production, busi-
ness based on networks, and online services. “Internet + convenient transportation”
has been promoted at a faster speed to develop intelligent transportation and facilitate
passenger travel. A national transportation and logistics public information platform
has been built and improved to promote the sharing of logistics information and
promote cost reduction and efﬁciency improvements in logistics.
(3) E-government Has Been Advanced. At the national level, the National Gen-
eral Plan for E-government was released to establish an overall coordination mecha-
nism for national e-government, organize the implementation of national comprehen-
sive e-government pilots, deepen the applications of e-government and explore the
22
Digital Earth in China
729
Fig. 22.3 The new generation of 3D GIS technology
Fig. 22.4 Using a 3D entity model to describe abstract 3D objects: a 3D of shadow, b 3D of
visibility
development of a comprehensive e-government pilot to promote the modernization
of national governance systems and capabilities.
The government of China issued the Implementation Plan for the Integration and
Sharing of Government Information Systems to accelerate the integration and sharing
of government information systems, promote network communication, data commu-
nication and business communication, and continuously extend e-government ser-
vices to the grassroots governments. E-government media have ﬂourished. Party and
government organizations and group organizations at all levels actively use Weibo,
WeChat, other clients and new media to publish government affairs information,
respond to social concerns, provide convenient services and promote collaborative
governance, creating effective platforms for building an online and ofﬂine commu-
nity and practicing the government’s mass line. Public security organizations have
730
J. Bi et al.
accelerated the application of new technologies and continuously improved their
ability and level of prevention and control, mass service, and social governance. The
construction of the social credit system has achieved remarkable results. The national
credit information sharing platform has been linked to 39 ministries and commis-
sions and all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. The total amount of
credit information collected has exceeded 6.5 billion items, and the system of joint
punishment for dishonesty and joint incentives for honesty between departments has
been improved.
(4) Information Services to Beneﬁt the People and Add Convenience. To develop
the network and information technology businesses, it is necessary to implement
people-centereddevelopmentthinking.Regionsanddepartmentsshouldregardinfor-
mation technology as an important means to safeguard and improve people’s liveli-
hood and should vigorously develop information services such as online education,
telemedicine, network culture, “internet + public legal services” and “internet +
public security” so that people can have a greater sense of gain in terms of sharing
the results of internet development.
“Internet + education” expands the coverage of high-quality education resources.
Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the construction and application of the “three
accesses and two platforms (network access for each school, resource access for each
class and space access for each person, and the educational resource service platform
and the educational management service platform),” the level of educational infor-
mation technology has been signiﬁcantly improved, and the promotion mechanism
for the participation of all society has been continuously improved. Applications
beneﬁting the people have been rapidly popularized. The interconnection of national
transportation cards has been advanced rapidly. China has actively promoted the
model of “internet + public security” and built the “internet + government service”
platform for public security to improve the service efﬁciency and extend the service
range. Many areas have expanded applications in other government public service
areas including resident health, civil assistance, and ﬁnancial subsidies, and initially
established a mechanism for the coordination and sharing of pension services and
community services.
(5) International Cooperation in the Digital Economy. International coopera-
tion in the digital economy has become a new highlight. China has promoted the
launch of the G20 Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative and
the Initiative for International Cooperation in “Belt and Road” Digital Economy,
actively promoted negotiations on nearly 20 e-commerce topics of free trade agree-
ments such as regional comprehensive economic partnerships, deepened pragmatic
cooperation in cyberspace, and promoted the joint construction and sharing of the
Digital Silk Road. The system for serving enterprises that work overseas has been
continuously improved. The channels for acquiring overseas enterprise information
services have been expanded, and the release of early warning safety information
has been strengthened. The “Belt and Road” big data service system has taken shape
to actively provide effective information and services for relevant enterprises, orga-
nizations and individuals involved in construction of the “Belt and Road”.

Summary
The goal of building Digital Earth in China is to provide crucial information tech-
nology and support resources for promoting China’s economic, political, cultural,
social and ecological civilization construction progress. The Chinese government
has attached great importance to and strengthened the top-level design for long-term
planning and speciﬁc implementation steps for Digital Earth in China. With the rapid
development of basic theory and innovations in common key technology and infor-
mation infrastructure in spatial information technology, Digital Earth in China has
experienced explosive development, such as in digital agriculture, digital disaster
reduction, and digital heritage. Digital Earth in China has been a model for the digi-
tal economy in some countries but not in other countries. This may be due to several
reasons, but the social system and government organization are important aspects
for the rapid development of Digital Earth in China. Although it has been successful,
there are also many problems regarding the future development of Digital Earth in
China, such as privacy, politics, possible access to government data by the public
and data sharing. The Chinese government must work to overcome these issues and
continue to focus on the development of Digital Earth in China

Introduction
As a new geospatial principle and interdisciplinary research area, Digital Earth
addresses the most fundamental problems of concern to all mankind—ensuring pre-
cise decision making, sustainable development, and efﬁcient use of limited resources.
These problems are particularly evident in large and diverse countries such as Rus-
sia. Two main factors determine the strong interest in the concept of Digital Earth in
Russia. The ﬁrst factor is the vastness. From a geospatial point of view, Russia is a big
landmass with extremely unevenly distributed population, resources, and infrastruc-
ture. For more than four hundred years, Russia has been the biggest undivided country
in the world, and national stability and sustainable development highly depend on
the quality of governance. Therefore, sustainable managing of vast and diverse ter-
ritories with the help of increasingly complicated hierarchical governing structures
was recognized as a vital problem many centuries ago. Sustainable development of
Russia depends highly on consistent and comprehensive geospatial data with a wide
range of scales and the ﬂawless integration of geospatial data of different scales and
different origins into a single heterogeneous dataset. As a geospatial approach with
radically new properties, Digital Earth is very attractive and promising, especially
for Russia.
The second vital factor that creates a strong interest in the concept of Digital Earth
in Russia is the predominance of space exploration in the national mentality. Russia
has the longest history of space exploration in the world. Applied space research,
especially the idea of holistic, non-mediated, direct representation of our planet using
remote sensing data instead of maps has become very popular and commonplace
for at least two generations of Russians since the beginning of the space age in
the second half of the 1950s. Wide usage of satellite remote sensing for decision
making, management and governance of all kinds and levels was very popular in
the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, and thus Digital Earth as new scientiﬁc,
technological and social initiative was met with great enthusiasm—Russian society
was mentally prepared for a new scientiﬁc revolution.
In 2005, the Google Earth online service was started, following the geoportal
Google Maps. This event marked the beginning of a great geospatial revolution in
Russia. As a bright embodiment of the Digital Earth concept, Google Earth was
almost instantly recognized in Russia, and new geospatial approach was widely
appreciated with remarkable speed. New, highly demanded, colored high-resolution
satellite images were recognized by Russian users as an invaluable resource for
decision making. However, the implementation of Digital Earth in Russia was a
rather long and controversial process. Understanding Digital Earth and the rapid
expansion of detailed satellite data triggered a long process of adaptation of national
legislation and management practices to the new technological reality. In the second
half of the 2010s, the process of adopting Digital Earth reached its culmination:
in 2017, the Russian government proclaimed Digital Earth as a new ideology of
national space remote sensing. In addition, a critical review of national goals and
space assets was initiated. The digital economy has been recognized as a new and
23
Digital Earth in Russia
735
ultimate goal for Russia’s technological development. Under these circumstances,
Digital Earth was gradually anticipated as a pivotal element of national command
and control infrastructure due to its organic compatibility with digital economy.
Currently, the synergy of both “digital” concepts is becoming an important factor in
the development of national industry, national technologies and the nation itself.
23.2
Prehistory and Precursors of Digital Earth in Russia
The importance of Digital Earth for Russia and its visible scientiﬁc signiﬁcance
raised the question of its prerequisites in national history. There are indications that
the essence of Digital Earth, as a new geospatial approach that was visibly different
from other geospatial approaches, was anticipated in Russia many years and even
centuries before the current geospatial revolution, and the concept of a universal,
direct representation of Earth has repeatedly manifested in Russian culture.
23.2.1
Cultural Precursors of Digital Earth in Russia
The ofﬁcial history of Digital Earth started in the eve of the 20th century, when Vice
President of the USA Al Gore introduced and described a new, promising type of
geospatial information systems—so-called “Digital Earth”—in his book “Earth in
the balance” (Gore 1992) and in a famous speech given at the California Science
Center in Los Angeles on January 31, 1998 (Gore 1998). Digital Earth was described
as a comprehensive, three-dimensional and multi-scaled model of Earth that could be
used as an ultimate collector of spatially localized information. However, this core
idea of Digital Earth was anticipated many times in different countries, including
Russia. One of the most unbelievably accurate descriptions of an informational sys-
tem that envisioned the future Digital Earth was made by the great Russian and Soviet
writer Mikhail Bulgakov (1891–1940). In his mystical novel “Master and Margarita”
(Bulgakov 1967), written between 1928 and 1940, he described a so-called ‘Globe
of Woland’—a magic globe that demonstrated and emphasized the ability to visu-
alize all events in any place of the Earth immediately, interactively, completely and
in full detail. The main features of the ‘Globe of Woland’ described in detail in the
novel accurately and comprehensively anticipated the basic features of the Digital
Earth approach—a three-dimensional, scale-independent, dynamic model of Earth.
Moreover, Bulgakov envisioned avoiding mapping signs to improve the quality of
perception, consciously anticipated and described in detail the basic principles of the
future Digital Earth with unbelievable accuracy nearly 60 years before Digital Earth
was manifested and interdisciplinary research was initiated.
Bulgakov’s ‘Globe of Woland’ also had a predecessor. There is opinion (Sokolov
1988) that the idea of the magic Globe was borrowed from the novel ‘War and
Peace’ (Tolstoy 1869) written by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910). The novel
736
Y. M. Baturin et al.
depicted an ‘alive and vibration globe without any dimensions’ (in original Russian
text) that the hero saw in a dream. This kind of impossible object could be regarded as
a metaphorical description of the idea of scale-independency. Notably, in the English
translation of the novel, this paradoxical property of the Globe was reduced to a more
imaginable form—an ‘alive and vibration globe without ﬁxed dimensions.’
Therefore, we assume that a representation of our planet as a scale-independent
and projection-independent, sign-less, space-temporal replica of real Earth was antic-
ipated, understood and popularized in Russia long before the establishment of Digital
Earth as a scientiﬁc paradigm, technological and social initiative.
23.2.2
Technological Prerequisites of Digital Earth in Russia
With the beginning of the Space Era a new, holistic vision of our planet as a live
Globe became widespread globally. The ﬁrst image of Earth from outer space was
produced in 1947 with the help of the US-launched German missile V-2 (NASA
2017). The ﬁrst satellite was successfully launched from the Russian space center
(cosmodrome) Baikonur in 1957. The American satellites Explorer-6, in 1959, and
TIROS, in 1960, provided the ﬁrst photographic and television images of Earth,
respectively. In 1959, the Soviet automatic station Luna-3 captured the ﬁrst image
of the far side of the Moon. In 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made the ﬁrst
manned space ﬂight (Afanasiev et al. 2005; Baturin et al. 2008). During his day-long
orbital mission ﬂight (August 6–7, 1961), the second cosmonaut, Gherman Titov,
took the ﬁrst photographical images and movies of Earth from space manually.
A new vision of Earth became very popular, especially in Russia as it was an
initial leader of the space race. The numerous beneﬁts and hidden potential of remote
sensing were quickly understood. This trend was ampliﬁed by the new concept of
state governing with the help of digital computer networks, proposed during the same
time by famous Soviet cybernetic and mathematician, academician Victor Glushkov
(1923–1982), the chief designer of the ﬁrst Soviet small (‘personal’ of some kind)
computer for engineering purposes ‘Mir-1’ (1966). He proposed and popularized
the idea of a so-called ‘OGAS’ (Universal State Automated System, or All-State
Automated System)—a net-centric, internet-like architecture intended for collecting,
storing and processing information on the state level to improve decision making.
The project was proposed in the 1950s, became very popular in the 1960s–1970s, and
gradually died out after the death of V. Glushkov in 1982 and as the country entered
a deep crisis in the end of the 1980s. OGAS was not centered on geospatial data, but
the clear necessity of spatial and temporal localizations of data in a universal, scale-
independent framework induced interest in new approaches to handling geospatial
data. The widely appreciated and supported concept of OGAS contributed to the
future explosive growth of common interest in the Digital Earth concept in Russia
(Fig. 23.1).
The fragmentation of the Soviet Union into 15 independent countries in 1991 and
the severe, prolonged economic and political crisis signiﬁcantly limited the scientiﬁc

potential of Russia and demands for innovations in the 1990s, and led to the shutdown
of many promising projects. In the eve of the new millennium, the manifesting of
Digital Earth in 1998 by Vice President of the USA Al Gore attracted the attention
of the Russian scientiﬁc community. A real breakthrough came in the middle of the
2000s, following the start of the Google Earth online service in 2005, establishment
of the International Society of Digital Earth (ISDE) in 2006, and proposition of the
neogeography concept the same year.
23.3
Introducing Digital Earth in Russia
One of the ﬁrst forerunners of Digital Earth in Russia was the virtual globe Arc-
Globe—a software module and 3D viewing environment for the popular software
ArcGIS (ESRI). ArcGlobe was introduced in the beginning of the 2000s and became
popular as an effective new approach for integration of geospatial 3D data into the
virtual globe. For the ﬁrst time, ArcGlobe allowed for a user to immerse data into a
rich geospatial context formed by global mosaic satellite images, and interact with
it. However, the low spatial resolution of contextual geospatial data provided on
DVD in the absence of online services and standalone applications as well as the
relatively high cost prevented the wide usage of this interesting product. However,
ArcGlobe ignited discussion about the future directions of GIS development and gen-
erated expectations for the emergence of a new type of geospatial product in the near
future. The ﬁrst products that incorporated the same approach to varying extents (e.g.,
NASA WorldWind, Microsoft Encarta, etc.) were introduced around same time, but
738
Y. M. Baturin et al.
were not widespread. For example, there are no mentions of NASA WorldWind in
the articles registered in the Russian national scientiﬁc electronic library until 2005.
The next big step toward understanding and assessing the new paradigm in Russia
was made by Google.
The start of the Google Earth online service in the ﬁrst half of 2005 provided
an inspiring and thought-provoking effect and triggered the process of adopting the
Digital Earth paradigm in Russia. Due to relatively good broadband access across the
country and free access to Google Earth in its basic conﬁguration, the high reliability,
very rich contextual data and pressing demand for correct and unmediated geospatial
data in the country resulted in amazingly rapid proliferation of the use of Google
Earth in Russia. In 2007, the ﬁrst open Russian model of a Russian city for Google
Earth became accessible through the web site (Wolodtschenko et al. 2015). The
model was based on a previous GIS-based model (Fig. 23.2a, b).
The model of Protvino was followed by others. They were increasingly used for
urban and regional planning, education, and monitoring of social processes in urban
environments (Fig. 23.3a, b).

Digital Earth in Russia
739
In 2008, the ﬁrst software tools for Google Earth developed in Russia were pro-
posed (Blogru.geoblogspot.com 2008). The scientiﬁc novelty of Google Earth and its
advantages were obvious, leading to discussion about the nature of new approaches
for working with geospatial data. In Russia, this discussion was induced by a com-
parative analysis of ‘Geography’ and ‘Neogeography’, initiated by A. Turner in his
book ‘Introduction into Neogeography’ (Turner 2006). In Russia, neogeography was
recognized and studied as a new scientiﬁc paradigm and quantum leap in cartography.
Therefore, it was eventually identiﬁed with Digital Earth as an advanced geospatial
approach, with Google Earth as its embodiment. Digital Earth was regarded as a sig-
niﬁcant innovation and promising achievement in a variety of geospatial products that
emerged, especially after 2005. This vision stimulated the search for scientiﬁc, not
solely technological, foundations of a new approach. In 2008, the ﬁrst Russian inten-
sional deﬁnition of neogeography, later adopted for the Digital Earth, was proposed
(Eremchenko 2008). The fundamental interconnection between Digital Earth and
the concept of situational awareness has also been identiﬁed and studied (Boyarchuk
et al. 2010). The philosophical effects of the new geospatial paradigm were discussed
in a comprehensive analysis based on the ‘Noosphere’ concept (Lepsky 2013). In
2008, a range of conferences dedicated to new approaches in cartography began to
be held in Russia annually, and a growing number of scientiﬁc articles have been
published each year.
In 2012, the book ‘Virtual Geographic Environments’ (Lin and Butty 2009) with
the chapter ‘Concept of “Digital Earth”’ was published in Russia. The ﬁrst scientiﬁc
article with the term ‘Digital Earth’ (in Russian) in its title registered in the Russian
ofﬁcial scientiﬁc database E-Library was published in 2013 (Lisitsky 2013). In 2015,
a common vision of Digital Earth and neogeography was proposed (Eremchenko
et al. 2015). In 2016, the ﬁrst scientiﬁc event was held in Russia (Novosibirsk),
organizedbytheISDEaspartoftheannualInterexpoGEO-Siberia2016international
conference (ISDE 2016).
The number of Digital Earth-related articles (Fig. 23.4) has grown annually. The
growing interest in Digital Earth stimulated its transfer to different areas. The Digital
Earth concept began to be perceived by a wide audience, especially among govern-
ment ofﬁcials. To some extent, 2017 was the watershed year.
At the 10th International Symposium on Digital Earth held in Sydney, Australia, in
2017, the Russian “Neogeography Group” was recognized as one of the founders of
the Digital Silk Road Alliance (DSRA). The DSRA will build a cooperative network
and a geospatial ‘think tank’ for the Silk Road countries and support the advance-
ment of geo-spatial information and sustainable development through international
cooperation within the Digital Earth paradigm (ISDE 2017).

equipment
23.4
Establishing the Digital Earth Russia Community
The understanding, development and adoption of the Digital Earth vision in Russia
were organized in an interdisciplinary manner from the beginning. A signiﬁcant part
of the efforts of the Russian Digital Earth community was dedicated to outreach and
the projection of the Digital Earth vision into different disciplines, industries, and
social groups to address vital problems of society. Conferences and meetings were
organized in different Russian cities (Fig. 23.5) for different groups of participants.
Discussion of the Digital Earth concept occurred during the annual Neogeogra-
phy conferences held in Moscow in 2008–2011, as well as at a long list of con-
ferences organized and supported by famous Russian scientist and expert in scien-
tiﬁc visualization, visual analytics, situational awareness and neogeography, Prof.
Stanislav Klimenko (1941–2018). In 2009, 2014 and 2016, the Digital Earth Vision
was presented and discussed at the Annual International Conferences “Information
and Mathematical Technologies in Science and Governance” held in Irkutsk and
Baikal (Siberia). In 2014, the Russian Digital Earth community helped organize
a special session on the semiotics aspects of geospatial visualization, “Neogeo-
Semiotic Synthesis”, at the 12th World Congress of Semiotics in Soﬁa, Bulgaria
(Semio2014.org 2014). Since 2016, the Digital Earth concept has been presented
during the annual InterCarto/InterGIS conferences organized in different locations
in Russia and abroad. From 2017, activity in the Russian Digital Earth community
began to increase. For example, in 2017, the Digital Earth Vision was presented by
23

741
Fig. 23.5 Spatial distribution of Russian Digital Earth centers and the locations of the most signif-
icant scientiﬁc Digital Earth conferences and other events in Russia since 2008
Russian supporters at more than half a dozen scientiﬁc conferences in different ﬁelds:
philosophy, visual analytics, governance, innovative economics, the Silk Road and
Belt Initiative, geography and GIS, monitoring and security, scientiﬁc visualization
and big data, aerospace and remote sensing, and cartography.
At some conferences, the Digital Earth sessions have become traditional (Neo-
geography.ru 2017, 2018). The Russian Digital Earth community has also focused
on outreach as a vital way to proliferate Digital Earth expertise and provide a syn-
ergy effect in the scope of Silk Road infrastructure projects and a Digital Turn in the
economy (Eremchenko et al. 2017).
The positive dynamics and fast recognition of the Russian Digital Earth commu-
nity attracted the attention of colleagues abroad. At the 7th Digital Earth Summit
held in Al-Jadida, Morocco in 2018, the council of the ISDE decided to organize
the next (2020) 8th Digital Earth Summit in Russia. It will be held in Obninsk—a
well-known scientiﬁc and university center with a history of being affordable. The
selection of the relatively small (approximately one hundred thousand inhabitants)
university town Obninsk with very diverse industry and science as the host of a Dig-
ital Earth Summit emphasizes the interdisciplinary and outreach goals of this forum
and demonstrates the signiﬁcance of Digital Earth in the Silk Road and Belt project
because Obninsk is a Russian hub of the Silk Road.
Establishing a national corpus of relevant scientiﬁc journals is also a key factor for
the successful development of disciplines, especially interdisciplinary ones. Scien-
tiﬁc articles about different aspects of Digital Earth are published in various journals.
In addition, the proceedings of the annual GraphiCon and InterCarto/InterGIS confer-
ences, the annual almanac Geocontext, and other sources of information are relevant.
To share the Digital Earth vision, internet portals, social networks, and media are
742
Y. M. Baturin et al.
actively used. Many reviews, news, and outreach-oriented discussion materials are
published on the internet portal NeoGeography.ru. Notably, Digital Earth in Russia
was developed mainly within the Russian linguistic context and terminology, there-
fore the constant coordination of discourse and results and harmonization of research
with the international community is a signiﬁcant issue.
Also in 2018, preparation for a Russian chapter of the ISDE was initiated (DERus-
sia.ru 2018).

A key factor of success in technological development is a clear understanding of
the nature of Digital Earth as a scientiﬁc paradigm and new approach for process-
ing geospatial information. Since the introduction of the Google Earth geoservice
in 2005, the discussion about Digital Earth in the Russian scientiﬁc community has
focused on fundamental issues, primarily on the problem of developing a scientiﬁc
deﬁnition of Digital Earth. Special attention was also paid to its paradoxical proper-
ties, primarily semiotic ones.
The following are the main directions of research of the Digital Earth phenomenon
in Russia (Eremchenko 2017):
• development of an intensional deﬁnition of Digital Earth;
• proposal of a typology of geospatial visualization methods;
• discussion of the semiotic implications of Digital Earth, including introduction of
the ‘zero sign’ concept;
• proposing and discussing the concept of georhetorics; and
• studying the concept of Digital Earth in the context of situational awareness, the
digital economy, visual analytics, and smart city concepts.
Digital Earth is also used in Russia to observe social processes in the urban
environment with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.

Digital Earth: Russian Government Initiatives
In May 2017, less than two months after the 10th International Symposium on Dig-
ital Earth was held in Australia and two weeks after announcement of the Digital
Earth Australia project, a similar Digital Earth-based concept of new space remote
sensing policy was ofﬁcially adopted by the Russian government (Kremlin.ru 2017).
At the presidential meeting on developing the space sector held on May 22, 2017, the
concept of Digital Earth was proposed and approved as a core idea of new national
policy in space. The Russian Space Agency provided information about the “Digital
Earth” project focused on stimulating development of the Russian economy in accor-
dance with new “digital” trends and an innovative “digital economy”. Digital Earth
23
Digital Earth in Russia
743
in Russia should become a central element of a highly effective national command
and control system to ensure sustainable development in Russia. The main declared
goals of the “Digital Earth” project are the creation and regular updating of a seam-
less raster coverage for the entire globe with 1 m accuracy (or better) and formation
of a family of new geospatial services focused on the urgent demands of business,
government, and society. Commercialization manifested as a fundamental approach
to satellite remote sensing. One speciﬁcity of the Russian policy in the ﬁeld of remote
sensing is the desire to ensure independence and autonomy in space. In accordance
with this policy, the country is developing all the elements of the infrastructure of
the future Digital Earth.
Development of Digital Earth in Russia and its infrastructural elements was sup-
ported by regulatory documents such as “The concept of development of the Russian
space system of remote sensing of the Earth for the period up to 2025”, resolution of
the Government of the Russian Federation No. 326 on 28 May, 2007, “On the proce-
dure for obtaining, using and providing geospatial information”, Bases of the state
policy of the Russian Federation in the ﬁeld of space activity for the period till 2030
and further prospect, approved by the President of the Russian Federation on April
19, 2013 №PP-906, the state program of the Russian Federation “Space activities
of Russia for 2013–2020” approved by the government of the Russian Federation on
April 15, 2014 №306, and others.
23.7
Infrastructure of Digital Earth in Russia
The concept of Digital Earth naturally integrates achievements in the ﬁelds of
space exploration, advanced technologies, promising areas of fundamental scien-
tiﬁc research, establishment of an appropriate infrastructure backbone, and social,
industrial and governmental demands. The need to revise the existing principles of
obtaining, accumulation, processing and use of geospatial data in accordance with
the internal logic of scientiﬁc and technological development was realized in Russia
in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century.
In Russia, this state-of-the-art system consists of number of components and
national assets such as a remote sensing satellite constellation, global navigational
satellite system (GLONASS) and a unique project of a common geographically
distributed information system of remote sensing (ETRIS DZZ).
23.7.1
Remote Sensing Constellation
Satellite remote sensing capabilities are fundamental to a Digital Earth-based infor-
mation system. Russia has long and bright history of remote sensing, though the
present constellation and its potential are rather modest. At the beginning of 2019,
it consisted of the high-resolution (better than 1 m) satellites of the “Resurs” family
744
Y. M. Baturin et al.
and moderate resolution (2.5 m) satellites of the “Kanopus-B” family, the meteoro-
logical satellites “Meteor-M” and “Electro-L”, as well as hydro-meteorological and
experimental satellites. Increasing the number of satellites and the capacity of the
national constellation of remote sensing satellites is considered a major national task.
A plan to increase the number of national remote sensing satellites from 8 (2017) to
20 by 2025 was revealed (Roscosmos.ru 2017). Highly reliable “Kanopus-B” satel-
lites work in the common constellation with the identical Belorussian satellite BKA.
As of May 2019, there were 7 satellites in the common “Kanopus-B” constellation
(6 Russian satellites and 1 Belorussian satellite).
23.7.2
National Global Navigation Satellite System
Global Navigational Satellite System (GLONASS) is a key national space resource.
A core element of GLONASS is a space segment that consists of 24 satellites that
are evenly distributed on 3 orbital planes (8 satellites in each plane). Like GPS,
GLONASS provided two free worldwide navigational signals (L1 and L2). Devel-
opment of GLONASS was initiated in 1976. The deployment of the ﬁrst experimental
satellites of the “Uragan” family began in 1982. The system began limited operation
in 1993, deployment of the full GLONASS constellation (24 satellites) was success-
fully completed in 1995, and full-scale operation of the system began. However, the
system degraded due to a lack of resources and incoherent national space policy.
Rehabilitation of GLONASS was stimulated by a federal special purpose program
initiated in 2002. Through this program, the orbital segment of the system was even-
tually recovered, and in 2009 GLONASS was redeployed and returned to full-scale
operation as a second global navigational satellite system for the world. Now, the
orbital segment of the system is based on “Glonass-M” satellites. GLONASS devel-
opment is regulated by RF Government Ordinance No. 189 “Supporting, developing
and using of GLONASS for 2012–2020” dated March 3, 2012. Development of
a new “Glonass-K2” satellite with improved speciﬁcations, deployment of naviga-
tional satellites with new types of orbits, and creation of a wide-area augmentation
system are planned.
In conjunction with another navigational systems like GPS, BeiDou and
GALILEO, GLONASS is actively used for creating new digital infrastructure in
Russia. One prominent example is the ERA-GLONASS system intended to generate
rapid information about car incidents. Since January 1, 2017, all new cars in Russia
and other countries of the Eurasian Custom Union must be equipped with ERA-
GLONASS car modules. A similar system, eCall, was developed in the EU and will
be technologically compatible with ERA-GLONASS.

23.7.3
The International Global Aerospace System (IGMAS)
Historically, the ﬁrst predecessor of the modern Digital Earth Russia system can be
considered, was the IGMAS (International Global Aerospace System) project pro-
posed in 2009 (Menshikov 2009). IGMAS was proposed as a “special space system”,
or system-of-systems, comprising space, aerial and ground segments and intended
for “real-time monitoring of asteroid and comet hazard… continuous incoming of
real-time forecast monitoring information on the occurrence of natural and manmade
disasters on a global scale, as well as timely detection of asteroid and comet haz-
ard and availability of such information to a wide range of consumers” (Kuzmenko
et al. 2010). The IGMAS project remained unrealized but contributed to the idea of
creating a uniﬁed global information system that met Digital Earth requirements.
23.7.4
The ETRIS-DZZ System
The “Digital Earth Russia” project that has been developed by the Russian Space
Agency since 2017 includes a new state-of-the-art ground segment system as a key
element—a ‘common geographically distributed information system of remote sens-
ing’ (ETRIS DZZ). The new system, developed by the “Russian Space Systems”
holding, was successfully tested and recommended for operation in 2016 (Rus-
sianSpaceSystems.ru 2016). ETRIS DZZ consists of 13 centers distributed through-
out Russia and abroad, including in the Arctic and Antarctic. Compared with the
existing single-point reception, the deployment of a system with a multi-point recep-
tion organization will signiﬁcantly improve the efﬁciency of the use of existing and
planned Russian remote sensing satellites due to the timely discharge of accumulated
information from satellite memory on most orbital turns.
23.7.5
The SPHERE Project
The ambitious SPHERE project was announced by the president of Russia on June
7, 2018. The project envisages the deployment of an extensive (approximately 640
satellites) LEO constellation aimed at solving three main tasks: communication and
internet access, remote sensing, navigation and geopositioning. There are three stages
of deployment of the system: 2022, 2024, and 2028 (Kremlin.ru 2018). The spec-
iﬁcations of the future SPHERE system and information about the satellites is not
accessible yet.

Services and Applications
Remarkable visualization of Earth with the help of state-of-the-art computer systems
is a prominent aspect of the Digital Earth paradigm. Historically, the Russian scien-
tiﬁc community has focused on the study of Digital Earth as a scientiﬁc paradigm
based on existing practical realizations (NASA WorldWind; Google Earth, ERDAS
Titan, etc.). In addition, the range of palliative, 2D geoportals such as Google Maps
was developed in Russia—Maps.Yandex.ru, Kosmosnimki.ru, etc. However, the lim-
ited capabilities of map-based geoportals are obvious and the demand for a real
Digital Earth-like solution persists.
In 2010, the ‘Geoportal of Roscosmos’ (https://gptl.ru) was presented; it was
promoted as an innovative, updated daily global coverage made using satellite
images. Low-resolution images are free of charge and accessible for any user, higher-
resolution images can be purchased. The cost of developing the ‘Geoportal of Roscos-
mos’ was estimated at approximately $300,000. Nevertheless, the need to create a
fully featured Digital Earth was obvious due to the practical needs of the vast country.
The ﬁrst national geospatial product that met the requirements of the Digital Earth
paradigm was the NeoGlobus software, developed in VNIIEM Corporation, a leading
aerospace enterprise specializes in producing satellites, including the remote sensing
satellite families “Meteor” and “Kanopus-B”. In 2010, NeoGlobus was presented
at the seventh international industrial forum “GeoForm+2010” as an ‘innovative
environment for integration of geospatial data’ based on a global seamless mosaic of
satellite images (VNIIEM 2010). NeoGlobus was proposed and implemented as an
environment for long-term planning and tasking for Russian remote sensing satellites
of the “Kanopus-B” family, and therefore its market niche was limited.
23.8
Digital Earth Russia: Private Business Initiatives
Russian private business was also involved in Digital Earth R&D. One of the most
successful Russian Digital Earth services that was implemented at the same time and
is increasingly being used in various ﬁelds is Sputnik GIS, developed by Russian
privately owned company Geoscan Group.
A predecessor of the Sputnik GIS project was started in June 2009 as a 3D globe
based on NASA WorldWind SDK, intended for spatial data visualization. Later, Sput-
nik GIS developed by Geoscan emerged. The history of development is interesting
because it is well-suited for the speciﬁc demands of the national Russian market.
Sputnik GIS is based on the Digital Earth paradigm but has a substantially and
gradually expanded functionality compared with most widespread solutions such as
Google Earth. From the beginning, Sputnik GIS was oriented for use by emergency
services for UAV monitoring. The ﬁrst versions had few features:
• Visualizing UAV ﬂight trajectories;
• Visualizing SRTM as a 3D surface on the globe; and
23
Digital Earth in Russia
747
• Visualizing UAV-borne data (orthophotos).
The next step in the evolution of Sputnik was creating a Ground Control Sta-
tion (GCS, Geoscan Planer) for the Geoscan UAV. The Geoscan GCS used a fully
3D environment and had the ability to plan ﬂight with respect to the local terrain,
modelled using the SRTM or other sources.
The third big step in Sputnik GIS evolution was releasing support for the Agisoft
PhotoScan *.tls format. This feature made Sputnik GIS a unique software solution for
3D modelling, visualization and analysis of cities. Along with *.tls format support,
basic measurements tools such as ruler, corner ruler and area were released. At
the same time, Geoscan ﬁnished the project of creating a Tomsk city 3D model
(Fig. 23.6). It was a rather ambitious project, because Tomsk is a big Siberian city
with a population of more than half a million. In addition, Tomsk is well-known for
its very rich and unique urban heritage, especially wooden architecture, which is very
difﬁcult to model in 3D. Nevertheless, the project was completed in a short term with
exceptional, unprecedented quality. Since 2014, the Tomsk city administration has
used Sputnik GIS intensively and successfully. Later, similar models were created for
other big Russian cities: Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Kazan, Tula, Veliky Novgorod
(Sputnik.Geoscan.aero 2018). Moreover, the practical possibility of creating high-
precision photo-visual 3D models of cities and entire regions has been demonstrated.
For example, a 3D model of the Tula region in central Russia (an area of more
than 25 thousand square kilometers, with a population of approximately 1.5 million
inhabitants) was successfully created.
Geoscan also developed and released new versions of Sputnik GIS with a num-
ber of features including change detection, volume calculation, section generation,

Fig. 23.7 Precise 3D model of historical Soﬁa Cathedral in Novgorod, Russia, created and visual-
ized in Sputnik WEB GIS
contour generation, slope maps, creation and visualization of the NDVI, thermal
maps and more. With the idea of involving UAV technologies in different industries,
Geoscan developed the Sputnik GIS product family:
• Sputnik GIS—for surveyors and urban planners;
• Sputnik Agro—for agricultural companies and individual farmers;
• Sputnik PTL—for energy companies; and
• Sputnik WEB—a web implementation of Sputnik GIS with cloud photogrammetry
features (Fig. 23.7).
Sputnik GIS has a long (nearly 10 years) history of development and is a mature,
versatile, functional, multipurpose Russian Digital Earth service, oriented toward
the speciﬁc needs of national and international (Arza-García et al. 2019) customers
and developed dynamically. Due to the user-oriented approach, signiﬁcant upgrading
capabilities and full integration with state-of-the-art UAVs, Sputnik GIS became an
effective replacement for Google Earth as a nationwide Digital Earth platform.
23.9
Conclusions
The Digital Earth paradigm has been actively investigated in Russia since 2005
and was anticipated many decades before. This anticipation originated from the
vitalnecessityofaglobal,scale-independent,three-dimensional,uniﬁed,unmediated
representation of geospatial context. Digital Earth is natural geospatial approach for
all cultures and nations, especially for Russia.
23
Digital Earth in Russia
749
Russian studies of Digital Earth were mainly focused on its fundamental issues.
A range of applications and online services, inspired by Google Earth, was created in
Russia and actively used, especially in state governance and emergency services. The
culminating point of the process of adopting the Digital Earth Vision was its mani-
festation as a core ideology of national space remote sensing in 2017. The process
of harmonizing national activities with the International Society for Digital Earth
through the establishment of the Russian Chapter of the ISDE has been ﬁnalized.
Some fundamental issues and effects of the Digital Earth paradigm, unveiled by
the Russian Digital Earth community, are fruitful and could impact a wide range of
disciplines. The process of harmonizing geospatial data within the new framework
of the ‘Silk Road and Belt’ and technological development of new generation of
geospatial services should also be fruitful. The future of Digital Earth in Russia
looks promising, bright and full of scientiﬁc and technological achievements.

Abstract Digital Earth (DE) education provides students with geospatial knowl-
edge and skills to locate, measure, and solve geographic problems on Earth’s sur-
face. The rapid development of geospatial technology has promoted a new vision
of DE to embrace data infrastructure, social networks, citizen science, and human
processes on Earth. The high demand for a geospatial workforce also calls for an
ever-changing, diverse form of learning experiences. Limited efforts, however, have
been made regarding DE education to adapt to this changing landscape, with most
interventions falling short of expectations. This chapter gives an overview of cur-
rent teaching and learning structures with DE technologies. Successes and obsta-
cles for K-12 education are explored ﬁrst, followed by classroom technologies and
experiential learning and outreach exercises such as academic certiﬁcates and intern-
ships in higher education. Taking the geospatial intelligence model from the U.S.
Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF) as an example, recent advancements
in DE education for professional careers are described via its geospatial competen-
cies, hierarchical frameworks, and credentials. In alignment with the principles of
DE development, future DE education calls for an integrated learning framework
of open data, real-world context, and virtual reality for better preparedness of our
students in the geospatial world.

Introduction
The vision of Digital Earth (DE), initially presented by former U. S. Vice-President
Al Gore in 1998 (Gore 1999), has been to build a multi-resolution, three-dimensional
representation of the planet in a system that allows users to navigate through space
and time and to support decision-makers, scientists, and educators (Grossner et al.
2008; Goodchild et al. 2012). With recent technological advances, the system is now
much closer to reality by utilizing vast amounts of geographic information. In the
Big Data era, new visions for DE are emerging to take into account the developments
in web-enabled sensors and opportunities provided by social networks and citizen-
contributed information. Advances in information technology, data infrastructures
and Earth observations, and the scientiﬁc and societal drivers for the next-generation
of DE have been highlighted in recent literature (e.g., Craglia et al. 2012; Goodchild
et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2017).
Little of the DE development focus, however, has been cast on education. The
descriptor of user(s) is generically deﬁned or refers to, at best, a few professional
organizations. Nowhere in this particular vision of users does the learner appear even
though education has caught the attention of DE proponents in the past (Kerski 2008;
Donert 2015). The focus of this chapter is on the learner and the education/training
structures that support teaching and learning with DE technologies. K-12 successes
and obstacles are identiﬁed ﬁrst, followed by higher education, professional cre-
dentialing opportunities, and ﬁnally the future of DE education and professional
development.
24.2
Digital Earth for K-12
A variety of geospatial technologies are currently used in K-12 classrooms, and how
to best do so has been pondered for some time (Fitzpatrick 1993; Nellis 1994). A
keyword analysis of the Journal of Geography—a journal primarily dedicated to
teaching and learning in geography—found ﬁrst-time article keyword entries for
remote sensing in 1990, computers in 1991, global positioning systems in 1993,
geographic information systems in 1993, and Google Earth in 2007, indicating a
steady progression of interest in these tools for education (Mitchell et al. 2015). More
attention has been placed on educational uses of Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) generally (Kerski 2008; Kerski et al. 2013), but concern for remote sensing
(Kirman 1997), Google Earth (Patterson 2007; Zhu et al. 2016), and other virtual
globe representations (Schultz et al. 2008) also is evident.
Classroom use of GIS began to appear in the 1990s (Kerski et al. 2013) and scores
of research articles related to its educational use have appeared since in journals such
as International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education, Journal of
Geography, and Cartography and Geographic Information Science, among others.
There are far too many sample articles to acknowledge in this short overview, but
24
Digital Earth Education
757
topics have included GIS and elementary school map skills (Shin 2006), bridging
GIS teaching and learning between high school and college (AP GIS&T Study Group
2018), and GIS teacher training (Hohnle et al. 2016; Hammond et al. 2018). This
interest was driven in large part by the ability to harness GIS for problem-based
learning and the study of real-world phenomena and concerns (Milson and Kerski
2012).
Several examples illustrate this last point. In the United States, Mitchell et al.
(2008) worked with middle school students to map hurricane storm surge and a
chemical spill in relation to vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly;
young people in 4-H clubs created trail maps and plotted locations for industrial
development (Baumann 2011); and The Geospatial Semester offered secondary stu-
dents the opportunity to learn about geospatial technologies and increase their spatial
vocabularies by working on local problems such as siting a solar farm (Kolvoord et al.
2019). Elsewhere, students have used the technology to design a high-speed railway
loop (France), map invasive ﬂora (Canada), and identify locations for street lights to
enhance public safety (Japan) (Kerski et al. 2013).
Whether and how GIS is used in instruction varies globally. The various structures
that govern education and curriculum-making are important drivers in this regard.
In countries where GIS has been made a part of the national curriculum, the spread
of GIS in education has been faster (Kerski et al. 2013; Rød et al. 2010; Lam et al.
2009). These countries include China, Finland, India, Norway, South Africa, Taiwan,
Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Note that, save for the Americas, these locations
span the globe.
These achievements aside, most advocates would be quick to admit, however, that
the promise of geospatial technology use in the K-12 classroom has fallen far short
of expectations (Collins and Mitchell 2019). Some of the original obstacles plaguing
greater use of geospatial tools by K-12 students remain depending on location; these
include the inaccessibility of computers such as in South Africa (Breetzke et al. 2011)
and Turkey (Demirci 2011) and not having a teacher and/or an educational context
whereby tool use is well-taught and encouraged (Mitchell et al. 2018). As previ-
ously noted, educational standards also vary considerably internationally, meaning
curricular integration of the technology can be equally variable. Improvements have
included a decrease in software and hardware costs and a much greater availability of
data—especially local data—for use in class projects. A focus on the student necessi-
tates an emphasis on their teachers as well. Three important aspects apply, here. First,
before a teacher embraces DE technologies they should also understand geography
as a discipline for the unique contribution a spatial perspective brings (Bednarz and
Ludwig 1997; Bednarz and van de Schee 2006). Too many teachers hold a narrow
and information-oriented view of geography that is limiting for instruction (Bourke
and Lidstone 2015). Second, a teacher must perceive DE technologies as useful and
able to create learning opportunities not afforded by other methods (Lay et al. 2013).
Finally, after fostering this positive mindset, DE teacher professional development
(PD) must include several key components.
In order for teacher’s DE PD to be successful, to have a “stickiness” (in other
words, staying power and continued classroom use), the learning experience must be
758
C. Wang et al.
of sufﬁcient duration. Too often geospatial training workshops are short in duration
with little ongoing support (Baker et al. 2015). Successful teacher implementation
requires long-term support instead of one-time PD. For example, Walshe (2017)
showed that pre-service geography teachers with “gradual yet repeated exposure
to GIS with increasing complexity across the [school] year” better developed their
practice. Professional learning communities also sustain DE use. A strong cohort of
learning peers can result in teachers from different disciplinary areas assisting and
working with each other (Mitchell et al. 2018). Encouragement by school adminis-
tration is crucial. Devoting new resources and allowing teachers to try something out
of the norm: these are DE features where administrative support is necessary (Hong
and Melville 2018). The best DE PD brings together diverse subject matter expertise
and connects the learning to the existing curriculum to elevate the relevance of the
tools to existing instruction (Hong 2014). Finally, extensive feedback and coaching,
from improving classroom delivery to growing teacher conﬁdence in using some
of the more powerful features of DE tools when teaching their students, is a nec-
essary support. Importantly, these ﬁndings are supported by work with educators
across many countries, including Germany (Hohnle et al. 2016), the United States
(Mitchell et al. 2018), the United Kingdom (Walshe 2017), and Hong Kong, China
(Lam et al. 2009), suggesting that common teacher-training approaches in DE could
be useful. A well-trained teacher corps that is mindful of how DE can be deployed
in pedagogically appropriate ways (Mishra and Koehler 2006) can lead to a student
population ready to connect DE technology with a problem-focused approach to
learning.
24.3
Digital Earth for Higher Education
In a geospatial world, “geo” is fundamental in preparing students with geographical
knowledge and skills to locate, measure, and quantify geographic phenomena (Med-
ina and Hepner 2017). In DE higher education, students are expected to build on a
ﬁrm math, science, and geography foundation with specialized courses in surveying,
cartography, photogrammetry, remote sensing, and geographic information systems.
The civil and governmental sectors of our society also are placing an ever-increasing
reliance on the ability to build, query, analyze and communicate geospatial informa-
tion to support a myriad of world issues.
24.3.1
Instructional Technologies
Pedagogical approaches for DE have developed rapidly, accompanying transforma-
tional changes such as crowdsourcing, cloud computing, and artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI) that impact geospatial technologies. At many universities, introductory level
GIScience courses are now taught online. Joyce et al. (2014) presented a remote
24
Digital Earth Education
759
sensing computer-aided learning (RSCAL) program released in 2013 in Australia,
which utilized interactive online tools to facilitate students’ active learning in class-
rooms. As a freely available online tool, the program interacts with a range of visu-
alization, animation, and audio to enhance learning of the fundamentals of remote
sensing. Torres et al. (2017) utilized WebGIS tools to enhance personalized learning
in landscape education, in which students learn the landscape as a diversity of spatial
elements and a complex system of physical and human factors. Many schools also
are making signiﬁcant efforts to infuse their GIS curriculum with a variety of com-
mercially available or open-source technologies such as QGIS (QGIS Development
Team 2018) and geospatial course materials developed by Boundless, a geospatial
technology ﬁrm.
Since the debut of geobrowsers such as Google Earth in May 2005 (Fig. 24.1),
these new geospatial tools make spatial data easily available worldwide and mark
an evolutionary point for the DE community (Foresman 2008; Bearman et al. 2016).
An increasing number of courses have adopted geobrowsers and virtual globes for
classroom use. A compilation of similar geobrowsers and virtual globes released by
a variety of private and public sectors all over the world is shown in Table 24.1.
These user-friendly digital platforms are visually appealing to students and present
a useful device for faculty to create a virtual Earth environment for interactive learn-
ing and enhanced student spatial thinking. By interacting with the real and digital
Earth and within collaborative environments, students not only use and analyse data,

but contribute to its collection, processing, and integration with other freely avail-
able platforms. DE is becoming an educational tool and a medium to facilitate our
improved understanding of both natural and human processes on Earth (Annoni et al.
2011; Patterson 2007). Geo-media, for example, is a recently emerging concept that
links geoinformation, online mapping, mobile APPs and volunteered geographic
information for multimedia representation in classroom usage (Donert 2015).
Rapidly evolving geospatial platforms, open-source programs, and citizens-as-
sensors (Goodchild 2007) allow for a higher level of spatial data adaptation in class-
rooms. These widely available geoportals, however, have their own limitations in
DE pedagogy. On the one hand, they put pressure on educators to continually update
their curriculum. Gaps between classroom learning and workplace frontiers are often
observed when educators cannot stay abreast of all new changes in the market. On the
other hand, some argue that while students can easily access spatial data using these
tools, the level of spatial literacy they gain can be reduced and their critical spatial
thinking skills can be endangered (Bearman et al. 2016). Most recently, numerous
geo-“hackathons” have been conducted around the globe where geo-enthusiasts cap-
ture geo-tagged information or data using a variety of tools (GPS, WPS, RFID, etc.)
which is then analyzed using GIS. The hackathon concept is intended to encourage
digital innovation with existing assets and resources (Briscoe and Mulligan 2015).
24

While hackathons provide opportunities for collaboration and ﬁeld work and allow
students to learn and manipulate the tools, limited timing and focused technologies
may have students entirely miss the geographic context and its principles.
24.3.2
Academic Curricula
As presented by the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organiza-
tion (UNESCO), education fulﬁls its valuable role of providing foundational knowl-
edge and skills, engaging critical thinking, and building students positive attitudes
to become active participants in a world characterized by diversity and pluralism
(UNESCO 2018). Within a “credentialism” concept framework built in the 1970s,
academic credentials continue to be the basic requirement for any professional occu-
pation. However, both industry and academic professionals have concerns over the
ability of academia being able to keep up with rapid industry changes. Graduating
students also worry that the skills and abilities gained are not job-market oriented.
Efforts currently are being made by academia, industry and government departments
tasked with education and training to search for the right mix of competencies from
across industries rather than from discipline-speciﬁc degrees.
As a consequence, DE concepts are offered in a multi-disciplinary education
infrastructure by departments that are more cross-disciplinary in nature. Educating a
student as a qualiﬁed geospatial analyst requires coursework in image interpretation,
geographic information systems, open-source information, geospatially referenced
data representation, management, and analytical skills. In the United States, more
than 50% of GIScience courses are offered in geography and environmental science
departments (ASPRS 2004); offerings also appear in other academic departments
such as forestry, oceanography, engineering, or even public health and political sci-
ence. The applied context of DE is positioned at multiple spatial scales and is inter-
connected among these disciplines. In a survey of 163 GIScience education pro-
grams at U.S. institutions in 2007–2008, Kawabata et al. (2010) reported that, while
geography departments were the major provider of GIScience curricula, 40% of the
GIScience degrees or certiﬁcates in these institutions involved multiple disciplines
and nearly 20% interacted with more than three.
Unfortunately, there is no standardized DE pedagogy. The DE curriculum has
complied with the systematic body of knowledge in GIScience for the collegiate
teaching community. Since the early 1990s, the National Center for Geographic
Information and Analysis (NCGIA) has recommended a core curriculum for GIS
(Goodchild and Kemp 1992) and remote sensing (Estes et al. 1993; Foresman and
Serpi 1999). Current GIScience curriculum has three primary concentrations:
• Cartography/surveying,
• Photogrammetry/remote sensing, and
• Geographic information systems/spatial analysis.
762
C. Wang et al.
Crossing academic boundaries, DE curriculum also is undertaken by industry
geospatial players in collaboration with or independently from academia. Students
now have much better access to hardware, software, course materials and data via
memorandum of understanding (MOUs), grants, challenges and scholarships, and
partnerships between individuals, industry, and schools. For example, Esri offers
GIS access to K-12 schools throughout the world, and the United States Geospa-
tial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF) has established agreements with Digital Globe
Foundation, Boundless, and Hexagon Geospatial to offer free software, data support
and high-resolution imagery for classroom usage. However, the formula for seam-
lessly transitioning across different DE concepts is still lacking. While those out of
academia focus more on technical and industry speciﬁc skills, universities continue
to hold the primary role in forming a well-rounded learner who graduates with both
a liberal arts background and technical, software agnostic knowledge.
The motivation to develop DE pedagogy and curriculum originates in a variety of
disciplines and is driven by various stakeholders. With increasing computing power,
the focus of DE has been moving toward the automation of tasks and dynamic visu-
alization of historic or real-time data. Making sense of data has led to a shift of
geospatial analysis from maps to models (spatiotemporal analytical methods; sta-
tistical, numerical, mathematical models) running on high performance computing.
These are now developed and used to understand complex adaptive systems found
in the natural or built environments as well as in health, political, social or economic
systems on Earth (Galvani et al. 2016). With advances in computer-processing and
broadband internet, geobrowsing has brought DE to the ﬁngertips of people world-
wide (Craglia et al. 2012). All these technological advances lead to changes in the
workforce and in the nature of how organizations operate and interact with each
other. This in turn requires re-imagining geospatial education in an excessively dig-
ital world as a customized and customizable package that takes into account rapid
shifts in technology (Kantor 2018).
But DE is more than GIScience and technological development. Critical spatial
thinking is a key aspect in geography as a discipline (Whyatt et al. 2011). Goodchild
(2012) proposed that DE represents the full integration of geospatial technologies
into the human activities of our daily life. In this sense, two learning objectives should
be amended to the skill-based GIScience curriculum above:
• Critical spatial thinking, and
• Problem solving.
Thinking spatially enables better interpretation of a digital world to reach a solu-
tion: space (where); representation (what); reasoning (why); and analytics (how).
Uttal and Cohen (2012) explored the relationship between spatial thinking and stu-
dents’ performance and attainment in science, technology, engineering and mathe-
matics (STEM) disciplines. Similarly, it is integral to everyday life and fundamental
to DE education. Without critical spatial thinking, students often ignore the context
setting of spatial problems when using GIS and remote sensing software (Bearman
et al. 2016). They may know very well how to run the models, but they also could
have a difﬁcult time understanding the extracted geo-information and therefore lack
24
Digital Earth Education
763
the ability to truly answer the complex spatial problems facing our world today.
Unfortunately, many universities still organize their GIScience courses based on the
transmissionofknowledgeratherthanonquestioningandproblemsolving(Cachinho
2006). With skills-based lectures and lab settings, the involvement of student’s criti-
cal thinking in current GIScience curricula has been limited. As outlined in Bearman
et al. (2016), DE educators can teach students to understand spatial issues in three
aspects: spatial data, spatial processing, and spatial outputs and communication. This
systematic set of training eventually links to a positive attitude of problem solving.
The challenge of developing DE curricula within such a rapidly changing techno-
logical environment has created the need to develop curriculum frameworks made of
standards, guidelines, and building blocks that can be shared and transferred across
educational providers, namely universities or private or government training agencies
tasked with workforce development (Malhotra et al. 2018). Reasonably, DE educa-
tion is restructuring from a skills-based to a competency-oriented model to meet the
rapid evolution of societal and workforce needs (Schulze et al. 2013). Reﬂecting a
variety of competencies, a number of geographic information science and technol-
ogy (GIS&T) bodies of knowledge (BoK) have been identiﬁed to guide GIScience
curricular development. For example, the University Consortium for Geographic
Information Science Body of Knowledge (UCGIS BoK) has been adopted by the
American of Association Geographers as a set of standards of GIScience learning
(DiBiase et al. 2006). DE education could follow a similar curriculum framework
from essentials to advanced functions. Its breadth of knowledge equips students with
geospatial and problem-solving skills to assist human activities in our society (Kantor
2018).
Even with these frameworks, challenges still remain in preparing qualiﬁed person-
nel for both today and tomorrow. To leverage them, external activities for experien-
tial learning such as internships have become common in academic and professional
development. These activities are crucial in shaping a student’s career pathway and
their implementation should start as early as high school.
24.3.3
Experiential Learning: Academic Certiﬁcates
and Internships
While academic degrees are still recognized as valuable for geospatial careers, the
complexity of the digital world, the fast-paced workforce environment, and contin-
uous technology innovation have all led to a focus on competencies. Good course
performancetowardacademicdegrees,however,maynotdirectlyfulﬁlspeciﬁcwork-
force needs, especially in the Big Data era with rapid technological change (Kantor
et al. 2018). By the time the technologies are taught, there is little time left for criti-
cal thinking, problem solving, and integration. Academic certiﬁcates and internships
are then adapted to prepare students for their geospatial careers. By interacting with
764
C. Wang et al.
targeted communities, experiential learning activities enhance community engage-
ment and foster critical spatial thinking of students in exploring cultural and political
issues (Sinha et al. 2017). This, then, meets the ultimate goal of problem solving in
DE development.
Academic certiﬁcates
Academic certiﬁcate programs are usually a series of courses provided by an edu-
cational institution. The certiﬁcate is granted as a proof that the coursework is taken
and completed in a satisfactory manner. GIScience certiﬁcates, for example, have
been offered as a suite of courses (12–21 credit hours) at numerous universities.
The course sequence matches the learning outcomes of the geospatial curriculum
framework.
The USGIF Geospatial Intelligence Certiﬁcate Program is an excellent example
of academic certiﬁcates in the scope of DE. Currently there are seventeen USGIF
accredited institutions in the United States and Europe offering a geospatial intelli-
gence certiﬁcate or degree. Their course curricula bridge classroom learning and pro-
fessional training and offer future decision-makers actionable insights about Earth
and its people for business, humanitarian, security, and defense-related decisions.
In general, current geospatial intelligence certiﬁcate/degree programs address three
overarching educational objectives:
• to provide traditional students with a broad base of the knowledge, skills, and
abilities requisite to work in the geospatial industry at an analyst level or higher;
• to offer a means of educating the non-traditional workforce by balancing work-
related training provided in formal collegiate education; and
• to leverage education, training, and work experiences to obtain industry recognized
credentials (certiﬁcation and licensure).
Aside from technical and discipline-speciﬁc applied courses, all students seek-
ing the geospatial intelligence certiﬁcate or degree also are required to complete
a capstone project/experience. As an example, the following outlines the capstone
requirements at Delta State University (Mississippi, USA), the ﬁrst institution to
offer an undergraduate geospatial intelligence degree:
• Applied projects: The program of work must demonstrate the use of geospatial
technologies to improve workﬂow efﬁciencies, consequence analysis, new appli-
cations or methods, or improve return on investment.
• Applied geography: The program of work associated with an applied geography
project must focus on improving the understanding of a geographic region through
the use of geospatial technologies.
• Geospatial education: The program of work must demonstrate a need for the
creation of educational materials pertaining to a common challenge encountered
when using geospatial technologies.
Academic certiﬁcate programs have been in effect in various countries. A good
example of international efforts is UNIGIS Distance Learning, a worldwide network
of universities from nine countries and regions including Austria, Portugal, Spain,
Hungary, Poland, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Latin America, and the United
24
Digital Earth Education
765
States (https://unigis.net/). Initiated in 1990, UNIGIS offers professional diplomas,
postgraduate certiﬁcates, and master’s degree programs in six languages within its
global network of ﬁfteen Study Centers. All of these programs are in the ﬁelds of
GIS, Geoinformatics, geospatial intelligence, and geospatial leadership.
Internship Programs
Traditional learning theories in academic curricula educate students for critical think-
ing, but often lack hands-on training to prepare them for authentic career work. To
ﬁll in this gap, many institutions have established internship programs to build a
ﬂexible learning environment for students to meet the rapidly evolving geospatial
landscape. For example, the University of South Carolina (South Carolina, USA)
offers an internship course—GEOG 595 (Internships in Geography)—as an experi-
ential study for geography majors and minors. Through a semester-long internship
contract with community partners, this 3- to 6-credit course prepares students for
the workplace and give students an opportunity to explore career options and to
put their skills into practice. For students in DE education, their internships engage
with private and public partners in the geospatial community to support personal-
ized learning. To establish a common ground for the program, it is crucial to build
a community network across competencies that share mutual interests in geospatial
analysis. The network comprises geospatial agencies and industries at local, state,
regional, and national levels to support interns with activities that vary in terms of
skill requirements and learning objectives.
The internship programs utilize a personalized curriculum and education metric.
The evaluation of an intern’s learning is job-speciﬁc. Given the diversity of intern-
ship activities for different interns, the learning outcomes cannot be quantiﬁed using
traditional assessment schemes such as quizzes, homework, and exams. Kantor et al.
(2018) propose discipline-based education research (DBER) in geospatial intelli-
gence to better educate students to think about and understand their location-based
tasks and to reﬂect back with improved outputs (Colom et al. 2010). The DBER strat-
egy can be embedded in the internship courses. With job tasks and learning outcomes
outlined in each internship contract, the intern perceives, understands, and embraces
the critical connections between geospatial competencies and the degree-offering
discipline. In this way, the curriculum is speciﬁcally designed to ﬁt different student
learning styles (Dolan et al. 2017).
Thepersonalizedcurriculumadaptivelyhelpsaninterngainhumanintelligenceon
problem solving by observing, measuring, assessing and reporting the problems, and
improving the individual abilities needed to cope with challenging situations. Human
intelligence points to the fundamental difference between humans and machines
when programming has reached its limits and run out of data (Hawkins and Blakeslee
2005). This type of adaptive learning (Posner 2017) is fundamental in DE curricu-
lum development, but has been a major drawback in traditional uniﬁed curricula in
classrooms.
Aside from the regular, full-time students in experiential learning, there is a grow-
ing student population formed of adult learners seeking to complete their degrees
or to earn academic certiﬁcates. Many of these students return to school with work
experience within the ﬁeld and are looking to gain recognized credentials that would
766
C. Wang et al.
help them advance their careers. Among various skills programs, one good exam-
ple is the Postgraduate Training Program operated by the Center for Spatial Data
Infrastructures and Land Administration (CSDILA) at the University of Melbourne
(Melbourne, Australia). The Center attracts world class postgraduates to gain special-
ized supervisory expertise in spatial data infrastructure. These students are motivated
and informed (with experience), expect to apply newly gained knowledge and skills
the next day, and thus create a different type of pressure on collegiate curricula.
“Experience” is now expressed in various forms, carries a multitude of names (i.e.
internship, apprenticeship, experiential learning, ﬁeld-based training, and working

Digital Earth Education to Professional Careers
The rapid development of geospatial technology enables considerable employment
growth in the geospatial technology industry as well as DE-related service employ-
ment sectors and ﬁelds. Geospatial technology has been identiﬁed as one of the three
(along with nanotechnology and biotechnology) most important emerging and evolv-
ing ﬁelds with the highest number of new jobs (Gewin 2004). The U.S. Department of
Labor reported an annual growth of 35% in the geospatial workforce (USDOL 2005).
Upon a worldwide study by Oxera (commissioned by Google), the global geospatial
services sector generated $150–270 billion per year (NSDI 2013). Various efforts,
from academia to workforce, have been made to maximally prepare students for the
ever-evolving geospatial world. For example, the Spatial Industry Business Asso-
ciation (SIBA), an association in Australia and New Zealand, has established an
educational initiative, Geospatialscience, to build an interactive network that bridges
school-age students with DE-related careers in the geospatial industry.
This section presents an example of DE education to professional careers in the
ﬁeld of geospatial intelligence, which has developed competencies to better com-
plement DE by illustrating its real-world application. The geospatial intelligence
model can serve as a catalyst for making the DE vision a reality via tools, expertise,
and techniques, and integrate them into a new interconnected platform. Geospatial
intelligence can bring these tools and perspectives forward to help extract actionable
information from vast amounts of geographic data. Closely related to this chapter’s
topic, geospatial intelligence already has a framework for teaching and learning that
could leverage DE education.
24.4.1
Geospatial Competency-Based Models
As early as 1999, Lucia and Lepsinger (1999) offered this deﬁnition of a competency:
“… a cluster of related knowledge, skills, and attitudes that affects a major part of
one’s job (a role or responsibility), that correlates with performance on the job, that
24
Digital Earth Education
767
can be measured against well-accepted standards, and that can be improved via
training and development.” This deﬁnition leads to a formula where competencies
(C) are proper subsets of well-accepted industry standards (IS), training (T), and
performance on the job (PJ):
C ⊂IS + T + PJ
(24.1)
This is a formula for training, but competencies also are becoming a major focus
in education. Competency-based education provides the foundational knowledge,
skills, and, most importantly, attitudes towards a profession. The purpose of “educa-
tion” is to ensure the attainment of these speciﬁed knowledge, skills, and “attitudes”
(Banathy 1968). Attitudes in particular are very volatile competencies and depend
on external inﬂuences and self-motivation. They also are very difﬁcult to assess and
thus improve. In education, the previous formula would look different as it would
need to incorporate these attitudes as essential in teaching students why to use the
system and how to improve it (at the graduate level), not just how to build and
operate it (technical training). Thus, the education formula is where competencies
(C) are proper subsets of well-accepted (industry) standards (IS), education (E), and
apprenticeship (A):
C ⊂IS + E + A
(24.2)
Both education and apprenticeship help build not only knowledge and skills, but
also attitudes designed and assessed according to industry standards. With changing
demographics in student populations (e.g., an increase in adult learners), as well as
changes in the modes of delivering educational and training content, attitudes are
becoming an important competency to consider in both education and training.
24.4.2
Geospatial Frameworks
Looking back at the geospatial credentials market, despite all the societal advances in
technology and connectivity, the 1999 view on competency-based training remains
unchanged while education continues to grow more interconnected with industry
standards. The major shifts in both have been witnessed by industry standards and
attitudes which in turn have impacted knowledge and skills or abilities expected from
the workforce. In building the geospatial workforce, several organizations have been
using collaborative and cross-industry efforts to identify job speciﬁc competencies
that are then followed by developing geospatial frameworks for competency-based
collegiate (4 year and vocational) and training offerings.
Two prominent frameworks are the Geospatial Technology Competency Model
(GTCM) designed by the National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence
(GeoTech Center) and the Geospatial Intelligence Essential Body of Knowledge
(EBK) designed by USGIF. Both competency-based models have been developed
768
C. Wang et al.
with help from subject matter experts (SMEs) from across industry, government, and
academia. The results should reﬂect the competencies needed by today’s geospatial
professionals and guide both educational and training curriculum development.
The GTCM was submitted to the U. S. Department of Labor (USDOL) in August
2018 and a working version was released in September 2018 (GeoTech Center 2018).
The GTCM has become an important resource for deﬁning the geospatial indus-
try and a valuable tool for educators within the domain of geospatial technology.
The University of Southern Mississippi’s Geospatial Workforce Development Cen-
ter conducted an initial effort in the early 2000s to deﬁne skills and competencies,
an effort that led to the ﬁrst draft of the GTCM. Work continued under the direction
of the Geographic Information and Technology Association (GITA), the American
of Association Geographers (AAG), and the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania (DiBiase et al. 2006) but it remained a draft. In early
2009 the GeoTech Center became involved in the effort to complete the GTCM. A
broad-based panel of geospatial experts were convened and suggested including two
industry-related technical competencies: industry-wide and industry-speciﬁc, in the
model. Public comments were sought, and comments were addressed with a ﬁnal
GTCM draft submitted to the U. S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Train-
ing Administration’s (DOLETA) Geospatial Technology Competency Model. The
draft was approved by DOLETA in 2010. The industry has continued to evolve and
grow and the GeoTech Center has undertaken the work to update the 2010 version
of the GTCM. Partnering with DOLETA, the GeoTech Center updated the GTCM in
2014. The USDOL prefers that competency models are updated every four (4) years
(GeoTech Center 2018). The 2018 GTCM update focuses on Tiers 1–5 as deﬁned
below:
• Industry-Related Technical Competencies:
Tier 5—Industry-Speciﬁc Technical Competencies
Tier 4—Industry-Wide Technical Competencies
• Foundational Competencies
Tier 3—Workplace Competencies
Tier 2—Academic Competencies
Tier 1—Personal Effectiveness
USGIF produced the Geospatial Intelligence EBK by conducting a cross-industry
job analysis to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities critical to the geospa-
tial intelligence workforce in consultation with psychometric consultants and the
geospatial intelligence community. Qualiﬁed Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from
government, industry, and academia participated in each phase of the job/practice
analysis to ensure an accurate reﬂection of geospatial intelligence practices. The
Geospatial Intelligence EBK was revised in 2018 and published in 2019 with major
additions and improvements. The GEOINT EBK describes geospatial intelligence
competency and practice in terms of key job tasks and essential knowledge, skills,
and abilities required for a professional to be successful. These are organized into
four competency areas as described below.
24
Digital Earth Education
769
• Competency I: GIS & Analysis Tools describes the knowledge necessary to ensure
the various elements and approaches of GIS and analysis are properly understood
in order to successfully capture, store, manage, and visualize data that is linked
directly to a location.
• Competency II: Remote Sensing & Imagery Analysis describes the knowledge
necessary to generate products and/or presentations of any natural or human-
made feature or related object of activity through satellites, airborne platforms,
unmanned aerial vehicles, terrestrially based sensors, or other similar means. This
competency area contains the knowledge necessary to synthesize technical, geo-
graphic, and intelligence information derived through the interpretation or analysis
of imagery and collateral materials as well as the processes, uses, interpretations,
and manipulations of imagery for dissemination.
• Competency III: Geospatial Data Management describes the knowledge required
to acquire, manage, retrieve, and disseminate data to facilitate integration, analysis,
and synthesis of geospatial information.
• CompetencyIV:DataVisualizationdescribestheuseofcartographicandvisualiza-
tion principles to generate products that represent information about the physical
environment that can be easily understood by decision-makers.
The Geospatial Intelligence EBK also includes cross-functional knowledge areas.
These are necessary when there are widely accepted knowledge, skills, and abilities
that transcend speciﬁc core competencies or where competencies are found across
the full scope of practice. Cross-functional geospatial intelligence knowledge, skills,
and abilities generally reﬂect:
• Qualitative “soft skills” used in geospatial intelligence,
• Unique aspects of the universal geospatial intelligence tradecraft applicable to the
majority of practitioners and,
• Common geospatial intelligence knowledge and practices that, if followed, will
improve the performance of a practitioner (USGIF 2018).
The Geospatial Intelligence EBK was initially developed for working profession-
als, not geared towards an academic curriculum. With the growth in the number of
academic institutions offering geospatial intelligence credentials (certiﬁcates and,
more recently, degrees), the EBK needed to be restructured for its broader audi-
ence. To make it more “academic friendly”, USGIF has invested in recent updates
of the Geospatial Intelligence EBK to include learning objectives at four different
experience levels and designed with regards to Bloom’s Taxonomy levels and psy-
chometrics. Faculty will now be able to devise and maintain a master course map
with formative and summative learning objectives as well as improve teaching and
learning assessments. Assessment data, captured by faculty, will be used to evaluate
student success with respect to each competency at the end of each semester. The
academic certiﬁcates are expected to provide a basal measure of competency across
the full spectrum of the Geospatial Intelligence EBK topics aimed at an “Essentials”
exam (already piloted during Spring of 2019) level that will allow students who
pass the exam to enter the professional world and gain an entry-level certiﬁcation.
770
C. Wang et al.
A geospatial intelligence degree is expected to provide the knowledge and skills
required at the Certiﬁed GEOINT Professional (CGP) exam level. Institutionally
designed frameworks for assessing student mastery is expected to be incorporated
into their existent learning management systems (i.e. Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas)
and the resulting data will be used to guide self-improvement. Student success rates
with credentialing exams taken post-graduation and job placement also could serve
as a secondary means of assessing program effectiveness. The 2018–2019 revision
and updating of the Geospatial Intelligence EBK started from a “matrix” tool that
was developed for each competency in the current EBK, followed by the identi-
ﬁcation of Emerging Geospatial Intelligence Competencies. Each matrix includes
competency speciﬁc topic areas in the left column, as well as questions pertaining to
each proﬁciency level (i.e., Prerequisites, Foundation, Application, Mastery/UGP)
in the subsequent columns. The questions read as:
• Question 1: What do you need to know to be ready to learn about the Topic Area
at a fundamental level?
• Question 2: What do you need to learn about the Topic Area at the fundamental
level?
• Question 3: What do you need to know to apply the Topic Area?
• Question 4: What do you need to know to advance fundamental knowledge in the
Topic Area?
The SMEs were then assigned a speciﬁc matrix to author, and added content
indicating the knowledge and skills necessary to adequately address each topic area
at the speciﬁed proﬁciency levels. Then, learning objectives for each matrix subtopic
(i.e., knowledge and skills) were generated by the SMEs (Table 24.2).
Therefore, the new EBK features the following:
• Vetted learning objectives for each subtopic identiﬁed during the “deep dive”
process.
• A numbering scheme for the EBK to facilitate easy communication and identiﬁ-
cation of learning objectives.
• A progression of subtopic knowledge necessary to grow and advance within a
given competency.
The new EBK format is signiﬁcantly more academic curriculum friendly and
helps guide the pathway into geospatial intelligence learning starting from high
school, moving into college, and then into the professional workforce. In addition,
the newly updated Geospatial Intelligence EBK has identiﬁed and recognized the
importance of a number of emerging areas, namely: Data Science, Use of varied
datasets, Machine Learning, Virtual reality, Neural networks/AI, small Unmanned
Aerial Systems (sUAS), Automation, and Critical thinking. Therefore, geospatial
intelligence has both human and technical scopes. People are essentially trained to
utilize various technical tools to understand human geospatial behaviour.
Today, the geospatial intelligence academic programs initially built upon the
GTCM are shifting their curriculum towards the Geospatial Intelligence EBK to
better reﬂect the program’s growth, maturity, and establishment as a standalone

nership between the GeoTech Center and USGIF to leverage the use and fusing of
both frameworks for the beneﬁt of the greater geospatial community. These frame-
works are being updated so that all the programs of study can maintain currency and
relevance to the discipline. To provide a balance of theory, technical skills devel-
opment, and ethical reﬂection, the presentation of knowledge required to achieve
professional competency would be sequential and interlocking. Programs of study
should aim to ﬁrst orient students to fundamentals before embarking on specializa-
tion, whereas specialization should serve as a means of broadening knowledge rather
than limiting practice.
In addition to the GTCM and Geospatial Intelligence EBK, the National Sci-
ence Foundation also has supported various projects aimed at the development
of job/occupation speciﬁc Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) frameworks (e.g.,
GeoTech Center produced a DACUM for GIS & Remote Sensing, Northland Com-
munity College DACUM for the sUAS maintenance technician, etc.). These newly
updated competency models demonstrate a movement towards making them more
“education friendly” via the introduction of learning objectives and outcomes as
well as a separation into levels of expertise based on Bloom’s Taxonomy. This again
demonstrates the need for a continuum between education and training in building
career pathways.

24.4.3
Geospatial Credentials: Certiﬁcate Versus
Certiﬁcation
Despite signiﬁcant efforts towards establishing, maintaining, and updating the com-
petency models in the geospatial community, the geospatial credentialing market
use of the terms certiﬁcate and certiﬁcation is confusing. There is ambiguity over the
terms as well as the credit value between course-based academic certiﬁcates offered
by numerous universities and those certiﬁcates and certiﬁcation obtained after attend-
ing an hour, a half-day, a full-day, or several days/weeks/months of training in person
or online.
The Cambridge Dictionary deﬁnes certiﬁcation as “a proof or document providing
that someone is qualiﬁed for a particular job, or that something is of good quality”.
It then goes further to imply that, for example, more adult workers are going back
to school for a certiﬁcation to improve their job opportunities. Based on the current
credentialing market, the rule of thumb is that certiﬁcations are geared towards to-
be-certiﬁed professionals; that individuals are at least at the journeyman level with a
balanced combination of educational credentials and hands-on, practical work expe-
rience; and that the credential needs to be maintained through Continuing Education
of Professional Development Units. One exception is Esri’s Technical certiﬁcation
that does not require maintenance because it is largely focused on Esri’s software
as opposed to the software agnostic certiﬁcations offered by the aforementioned
professional organizations.
In comparison, an academic certiﬁcate does not require maintenance once stu-
dents complete the required courses. Therefore, certiﬁcations and certiﬁcates can be
divided into three different major categories, all functioning under a larger “creden-
tials” umbrella (Fig. 24.2).
The American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS), the
GIS Certiﬁcation Institute (GISCI), the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
(NGA) GEOINT Professional Certiﬁcation (GPC), and the USGIF Certiﬁed
Fig. 24.2 Geospatial credentials
24
Digital Earth Education
773
GEOINT Professional (CGP) and Universal GEOINT Professional (UGP) are major
players in the professional geospatial certiﬁcation arena (Fig. 24.2). These groups are
making signiﬁcant efforts to maintain software agnostic credentials. These creden-
tials can be earned by documenting relevant educational achievements, professional
experience, contributions to the profession, and by afﬁrming a commitment to ethical
practices.
In brief, ASPRS is a scientiﬁc association serving thousands of professional
members around the world with the mission “to advance knowledge and improve
understanding of mapping sciences to promote the responsible applications of pho-
togrammetry, remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and supporting
technologies” (ASPRS 2004). ASPRS offers ten certiﬁcations (Table 24.3) geared
towards photogrammetrists, mapping scientists, and technologists. GISCI is a non-
proﬁt organization that provides the GIS community with a certiﬁcation program
leading to GISP® (Certiﬁed GIS Professional). NGA offers the government a focused
GEOINT Professional Certiﬁcation (GPC) program as part of a broader Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) initiative to further professionalize the
Department of Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE) workforce (NGA 2018).
USGIF is a more recent addition to the professional certiﬁcation community, but
the only one to offer a sequence of geospatial intelligence credentials that range from
rigorously evaluated academic curricula via USGIF accreditation of certiﬁcates and
degrees to the offering of an Essentials (entry-level) exam and professional certi-
ﬁcations. The USGIF accredited programs offer certiﬁcates that require at least 18
(undergraduate) or 12 (graduate) credits of coursework, including a capstone project
resulting from research, internship, or apprenticeship work. The value of these certiﬁ-
cates is considered superior to that of other “certiﬁcate” credentials given the depth
and breadth of required curricula. With the spring 2019 planned introduction of its
Essentials exam and its ongoing K-12 curricula development efforts, USGIF intends
to bridge the gap between high school prerequisites, collegiate credentials, and pro-
fessional certiﬁcations in a continuum of building blocks based on the Geospatial
Intelligence EBK (USGIF 2018).
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) “provides a consensus process that com-
munities of interest use to solve problems related to the creation, communication and
use of spatial information” through the OGC Standards Program and, lately, its own
certiﬁcation and training (Open Geospatial Consortium 2018). OGC’s standards are
used by its community of interest which includes those in aviation (air travel safety
and operational efﬁciency), built environment and 3D (open standards to support
productivity across the supply chains of the building design, physical infrastructure,
capital project and facilities management industries), energy and utilities, emer-
gency response and disaster management, business intelligence, and defense and
intelligence. In academia, OGC provides a fertile environment in which university
geomatics, computer science, geography, and geoscience departments can modernize
and advance their curricula.

As evidenced in this section, there have been signiﬁcant advances in the geospatial
educational and professional communities. Most organizations agree that competen-
cies are best learned by following updated frameworks that are in line with indus-
try standards as well as through experiential educational practices which include
practicum, cooperative learning, internships, and that have no cost limitations. The
geospatial intelligence community has achieved signiﬁcant partnerships and shared
24
Digital Earth Education
775
credentialing but is still working to achieve full collaboration. A shared understand-
ing of the end value is needed to reduce the uncertainty of value and disruption in
academia.
24.4.4
Geospatial Intelligence Bridging Academic
and Professional Connections
The rapidly evolving geospatial intelligence ﬁeld demands that academic education
and professional training complement each other. The community educates students
in critical spatial thinking and the conceptual use of technology to solve unstruc-
tured problems, while training focuses on increased performance in described cir-
cumstances (Kantor et al. 2018). The critical balance of academic education and
practical skills training, which is necessitated throughout a geospatial intelligence
professional’s career, is illustrated by the age-old adages of individuals “being edu-
cated but poorly trained” or “well-trained and poorly educated” (Burrus 2016).
The core of geospatial intelligence includes providing geospatial insights to deci-
sionmakers about human needs and potentially addressing the impact of false geospa-
tial information that arises in a competitive environment. As a meta-discipline, it
entails a view of professional know-how unbounded by typical academic and orga-
nizational limits and barriers. This is to say, geospatial intelligence is not simply a
collaboration of ﬁelds, but rather a fundamental merging of disciplines in theoretical
and practical ways. This implies that for one to legitimately be an expert in geospatial
intelligence and DE, the individual must have know-how in many traditional domains
including the technical, the human, and the problem’s domain.
Geospatial intelligence also is polymorphic which explains the discipline’s deﬁ-
nitional challenge. This elusive explanation is similar to that described in the Indian
parable of the blind men trying unsuccessfully to identify an elephant by touching
just one of its different parts. As the poet Godfrey Saxe (1816–1997) wrote, “…,
each was partly in the right, they all were in the wrong” (Saxe 1963).
Geospatial intelligence is a sub-discipline of geography being offered in forms
of certiﬁcates and academic degrees at universities in the United States and Europe
and is also cross-disciplinary in nature. It is still evolving. Moving beyond defense-
related issues, the ﬁeld now is leading the integration of concepts and practices in
oil and gas, health, business, precision agriculture, and emergency response to name
a few. It beneﬁts engineers who build and improve weather satellites, scientists who
gather measurements of atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic conditions, database
managers, Big Data analysts, business analysts who conduct cost and marketing
analyses, political scientists involved in national and international conﬂict resolution,
law enforcement in their efforts to not only reduce but mitigate crime, and even
farmers seeking the best options to increase their yields.
776
C. Wang et al.
While some are still hesitant to embrace geospatial intelligence because of its
historic association with the U. S. intelligence community, there is growing under-
standing that geospatial intelligence, like DE, brings a uniﬁed geospatial approach
to addressing the human and environmental challenges of today and tomorrow. It
has been practiced by many nations although often different terminology is used.
Research on the United Kingdom and Russia highlights the lesson that success in
geospatial intelligence is the combination of the utilitarian aspects of technology
mixed with a sophisticated understanding of the mental maps of our self, our part-
ners, and our rivals (Bacastow 2019). Geospatial intelligence’s evolution offers a
model of how DE could leverage education and training to advance the perspective
where politics and culture are resistant. Geospatial intelligence’s experience offers
DE an example of how a cohesive curriculum can advance and help to deﬁne value.
24.5
The Future of Digital Earth Education
Based upon a decade of dialogue hosted by the ISDE, three Pivotal Principles have
been identiﬁed to guide DE development in the 21st Century: open data, real-world
context, and informed visualization for decision support (Desha et al. 2017). These
principles call for higher accessibility and a broader, interdisciplinary context of Big
Earth Data and advanced analytical visualization skills for sustainable governance
and decision making. This is necessary for building an overarching framework for
future DE education from K-12 to professional careers.
24.5.1
DE Future in K-12
DE technologies show great promise and growth potential in K-12 education, how-
ever, a number of impediments remain. Some obstacles are technical while others are
institutional. As technology penetrates classrooms more readily as infrastructure and
hardware costs decrease (more so in developed rather than less developed countries),
it is the latter problem—institutional—that requires greater intervention. Focusing
on improving pre-service teacher training programs to include more geography and
DE technologies can encourage greater use and application. This will need to be fol-
lowed with intensive feedback and coaching with established teachers. Research has
shown that these concerns appear across the globe (Germany, Hong Kong, United
States, United Kingdom, elsewhere); time and monetary resources will need to be put
in place to effect substantive change. A second necessity will be to include DE tech-
nologies within academic standards. These agreed upon learning objectives drive
curriculum, and if DE is speciﬁcally included then usage will rise. A number of
countries have successfully done so already, but these are countries with centralized
national curricula. Countries with decentralized education systems will likely remain
fragmented in their K-12 DE development. In sum, K-12 DE use currently remains
24
Digital Earth Education
777
scattershot and spatially variable. Although exciting projects appear in a few special
cases, large-scale implementation has been elusive, and DE’s K-12 potential remains
untapped.
24.5.2
Micro-credentials
Credentials, in the form known by us today, may be very different in the future.
Customization may include different time frames and delivery formats, as well as
learning content that is narrower and focused on speciﬁc technologies and compe-
tencies, and delivered via transportable and transparent credentials and by traditional
(universities) and/or less traditional (industry) institutions. Ultimately, all credentials
should serve a larger purpose—that of building a networked human society ready to
tackle the environmental, social, and economic challenges that lie ahead.
To address the rapid changes in technology and workforce competency needs,
the future seems to favor a combination of credentials, from the micro-credentials
enhanced by digital badges to degrees and certiﬁcates. More recent on the creden-
tialing market, a micro-credential is a digital currency that recognizes competency
in a speciﬁc task, knowledge, or skill and that the individual can use and share across
various outlets (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook) to enhance their marketability and give
them a competitive edge (e.g. it can be combined with digital badges). Created as
self-paced, shorter modules, micro-credentials can be more easily designed to mir-
ror changing market trends. Also, they can be more affordable and easily digested
by potential students, especially by the adult learners. Micro-credential requirements
vary signiﬁcantly from credential to credential since anyone can grant them and there
are no ofﬁcial requirements.
Typically, micro-credentials are shorter than other credential options like college
degrees or certiﬁcate programs; however, that is not always the case since the require-
ments are usually determined by the credential-granting institution. Because of the
lack of consensus in terms of format and deﬁnition of what micro-credentials should
entail, the reputation of the institution offering them still plays a major role in one’s
decision to pursue these credentials.
If carefully designed and implemented, they represent creative ways to bridge the
gap between traditional higher education and 21st century technology and beyond.
However, while designed for a speciﬁc purpose, micro-credentials should be thought
of and planned in sequences and represent milestones in one’s educational pathway
(e.g. used toward a certiﬁcate and/or degree) and professional development. The
existent geospatial models should be used as frameworks in the design of DE cre-
dentials to reﬂect annual changes and create a common language across the geospatial
community.
778
C. Wang et al.
24.5.3
Challenges and Opportunities for DE Education
and Professional Development
Today, it is not surprising that DE-related credentials support the acquisition, under-
standing, management, analysis, visualization and (to some extent) ethics of data.
According to Grossner and Clarke (2007), the term DE has come to represent a
global technological initiative, but also “an intellectual movement.” While the human
aspects of DE were articulated by Foresman (2008), the current DE focus is still on
the technical issues of the problem without much regard to its human aspects. The
vision of DE should not be solely about space and spatial relations but also about
place, culture and identity, spanning the entire physical and virtual space (Craglia
et al. 2012). This new vision is still only slowly being adopted and there is uncer-
tainty related to the needed competencies required in the preparation of future DE
specialists. The future of DE should be planned on several important pillars:
• Education: provides a liberal arts background, methodologies, and depth as well
as breadth of thinking. The human is ultimately where knowledge work is done
and those insights are produced in geospatial intelligence. It is dependent on the
geospatial analyst’s meta-knowledge.
• Training/Professional development: built on education and expanding the knowl-
edge base for increased performance. The training and professional development
should focus on the human-machine team where there is a focused effort to develop
information about relationships among disparate objects and events.
DE education and professional development can be implemented in several sub-
sets as below:
• Competencies: industry-based but also focused on improving attitudes towards the
discipline and the understanding of its larger, community implications.
• Technology: seen as a needed but also ubiquitous tool where abilities improve
with experience and require ﬂexibility to adjust to rapid changes;
• Leadership: the capacity to have a balanced combination of education and train-
ing/professional development to gain a holistic understanding of the problem
beyond technology, combined with vision, a positive attitude, and strategic think-
ing.
• Research: the capacity to have a higher level of education and training/professional
development coupled with imagination, creativity and positive attitudes to further
contribute to the advancement of geospatial theory and knowledge as well as new
improved technologies and innovative ideas.
• Education research: discipline-based education research (DBER) focused on better
understanding the science of teaching and learning within and across geospatial
disciplines and with sufﬁcient resources to contribute to improved pedagogy and
andragogy.
These subsets can ﬁt under both education and training/professional development
in various forms and shapes. While there is a classic continuum of education mov-
ing into training/professional development, the future movement may not be linear,

but circular in nature. Certiﬁcates, certiﬁcations, and micro-credentials can be cus-
tomized to ﬁt individual pathways at different times in one’s career. High levels
of ﬂexibility, creativity, positive attitudes, and time-relevant education research and
implementation will be vital in a society rapidly embracing the Digital Earth. We
have been deeply transformed by a (geo)digital revolution, reaching a moment where
technology is becoming a commodity more so than a skill. The future will (hope-
fully) bring us back to what makes us intelligent creatures on Earth, ones capable of
innovation, creativity, imagination, and ethical conduct.

Digital Earth Ethics
Yola Georgiadou, Ourania Kounadi and Rolf A. de By
Abstract Digital Earth scholars have recently argued for a code of ethics to protect
individuals’ location privacy and human dignity. In this chapter, we contribute to the
debate in two ways. First, we focus on (geo)privacy because information about an
individual’s location is substantially different from other personal information. The
compound word (geo)privacy suggests that location can be inferred from people’s
interests, activities, and sociodemographics, not only from traditional geographic
coordinates. (Geo)privacy is a claim of individuals to determine for themselves when,
how, and to what extent location information about them is communicated to others.
Second, we take an interdisciplinary perspective. We draw from (geo)computing to
describe the transformation of volunteered, observed, and inferred information and
suggest privacy-preserving measures. We also draw from organization studies to dis-
sect privacy into ideal types of social relationships and privacy-preserving strategies.
We take the point of view of Alice, an individual ‘data subject’ encountered in data
protection legislation, and suggest ways to account for privacy as a sociocultural
phenomenon in the future. Although most of the discussion refers to the EU and
the US, we provide a brief overview of data protection legislation on the African
continent and in China as well as various global and regional ethics guidelines that
are of very recent vintage.

Introduction
The previous chapters of the Manual of Digital Earth describe remarkable progress
to date. Key technologies envisioned by Vice President Gore in 1998 are now in place
for the ﬁrst-generation and next-generation Digital Earth (DE). Similar progress in
DE ethics is not yet evident despite the early ethical stirrings in the geographic
community. As early as 1990, at a roundtable on Ethical Problems in Cartography,

Y. Georgiadou et al.
Brian Harley wondered whether cartography was out of step with other disciplines.
He suggested that the real ethical priority is for a map to be a socially responsible
representation of the world: “Can there be an ethically informed cartography and
what should be its agenda? [S]hould we be concerned with transcendental values
that go to the heart of social justice in the world at large?” (Harley 1991, p. 9).
In this chapter, we update Harley’s vocabulary for the current era of dataﬁcation
of everyday life (Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger 2013) and explore the Ethics of
Where instead of the ethics of cartography. This leads us to recent debates on data
justice—fairness in the way people and their resources are made visible, represented
and treated as a result of their digital data production (Taylor 2017).
In 2012, DE scholars observed that any effort to develop a next-generation Digital
Earth will require a principle of privacy protection that minimally guarantees control
over any individual’s locational privacy and the ability to turn it on or off at will.
They noted, “there is also room for a Digital Earth code of ethics that could set
standards for behavior in a complex, collaborative enterprise […] necessary to
tackle the growing issues of privacy and ethics that are associated with access to ﬁne-
resolution geographic information” (Goodchild et al. 2012, pp. 11092–3). In 2014,
some of the authors of the previous paper reiterated the call for privacy and reafﬁrmed
the need for a code of DE Ethics. They argued that “technological advancements
have to be accompanied by the development of a DE code of ethics that ensures
privacy, security, and conﬁdentiality in a world where everybody can be connected
to everybody else and everything all the time. Without solving this critical dilemma
and allowing people to decide whether or not they want to be connected and how
much of their thoughts and emotions they want to share, the dream of a wonderful
virtual future may well turn into DE nightmare” (Ehlers et al. 2014, p. 13). They
boldly suggested that Digital Earth should follow the Kantian ethics of personal
autonomy and human dignity in composing its code.
An obvious source of inspiration and lessons for such a code are the practices of
the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which represents and regulates
the behavior of a global computing community of approximately 100,000 members.
In 2018, the ACM updated its Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to address
the signiﬁcant advances in computing technology and the growing pervasiveness of
computing in all aspects of society (ACM Code Task Force 2018). The responsibility
to respect privacy, one of the seven general ethical principles in the ACM Code of
Ethics, applies to computing professionals in a profound way. The ACM urges com-
puting scholars and professionals to become conversant in the various deﬁnitions
and forms of privacy and understand the rights and responsibilities associated with
the collection and use of personal information. The ACM appeals to all comput-
ing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students,
inﬂuencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Given
that big computing companies have a signiﬁcant impact on society, we should explore
how their views on privacy have diverged over time from the current ACM ideal and
how they contest privacy as a concept. Some consider privacy irrelevant. As early
as 1999, Scott McNealy, the founder and CEO of Sun Microsystems, declared “you
have zero privacy … get over it,” a statement some in the privacy industry took as
25
Digital Earth Ethics
787
tantamount to a declaration of war (Sprenger 1999). Others consider it an evolving
social norm. In 2010, Mark Zuckerberg claimed that “people have really gotten com-
fortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and
with more people,” he said. “The [privacy] social norm is just something that has
evolved over time” (Johnson 2010). Others such as Apple CEO Tim Cook note that
“the poor privacy practices of some tech companies, the ills of social media and the
erosion of trust in [Cook’s] own industry threaten to undermine “technology’s awe-
some potential” to address challenges such as disease and climate change” (Romm
2018).
Privacy is a contested concept for good reasons. First, the etymology—the his-
tory of linguistic forms—reveals how privacy changed meaning from derogatory to
laudatory. The ancient Greek word „δι ´ωτης (pronounced idi¯ot¯es) originally meant a
private man, an ignoramus, as opposed to δημ´oσιoς (pronounced d¯emosios; meaning
‘of the people’), a person of public distinction (Liddell and Scott 1940). Currently,
the stem of idi¯ot¯es forms the word idiot and d¯emos is one of the two stems of democ-
racy. The word private in Latin meant ‘deprived’ of public ofﬁce–privacy designated
a (negative) state of deprivation. For instance, a private in the army is a person with
no rank or distinction and very little privacy (Glanville 2018). Second, privacy is
contested because it can be portrayed in various competing ways—as a positive or
negative right (Floridi 2014); as an instrument for Kantian ethics—human dignity
and personal autonomy; and as an instrument for Aristotelean virtue ethics—per-
sonal development and human ﬂourishing (van der Sloot 2014). The watershed US
Supreme Court case, Kyllo v. United States, reported in Mulligan et al. (2016) and
reproduced in the box below, is an example of how a seemingly simple case of home
privacy violation was contested by the defendant, the federal government and the
Supreme Court in 2001. The ﬁve to four decision of the Supreme Court eventually
upheld the Fourth Amendment—the right of an individual to retreat into his own
home and be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion, in this case, free from
the intrusion of a thermal imaging device deployed by a federal agent to scan the
outside of Kyllo’s home (US Supreme Court 2001).
Kyllo v. United States involved an investigation of a marijuana cultivation and
distribution operation in which a federal agent used a thermal imaging device
to scan the outside of Kyllo’s home. The resulting thermal image was used to
obtain a warrant to search the house. Kyllo moved to suppress the evidence
recovered from the search of his home, arguing that the use of the thermal
imaging device to scan it was an invasion of his reasonable expectation of
privacy. In a ﬁve to four decision, the Supreme Court held that ‘obtaining
by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of the
home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical “intrusion
into a constitutionally protected area”, constitutes a search—at least where
(as here) the technology in question is not in general public use’.

The Kyllo case was contested at every level. The parties disagreed over the
object of privacy under contention. The government argued that Kyllo had no
expectation of privacy in ‘the heat emitted from the home’, while Kyllo argued
that what privacy protected was the ‘private activities’ occurring within the
home. The ﬁve justices who made up the majority determined that the case was
about the ‘use of technology to pry into our homes’, the related matter of the
sanctity of ‘private lives’, and the need to draw a not only ‘ﬁrm but also bright’
line to protect the sanctity of the home and the activities occurring within it.
During oral argument, the justices drew attention to evidence provided to
the appellate court revealing that a thermal image reading could ‘show[ed]
individuals moving . . . inside the building’ to emphasize that what was at risk
was not data, but ‘what’s going on in the house’.
The dissenting justices drew a distinction between ‘through-the-wall
surveillance that gives the observer or listener direct access to information’
and ‘inferences from information in the public domain’ explaining that infer-
ences drawn from ‘gathered data exposed on the outside of petitioner’s home’
did not intrude on privacy. Justice Stevens’s writing for the dissent explained,
‘it would be quite absurd to characterize [the police’s] thought processes’—the
inference they drew from the data that seeped through the walls—as ‘searches’.
The majority justiﬁed its decision to prohibit the use of thermal imagers absent
a warrant in order to protect the privacy of in-home activities on the basis that
‘at the very core’ of the Fourth Amendment ‘stands the right of a man to retreat
into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intru-
sion’. The ruling was justiﬁed by the need to limit the Government’s access to
individuals’ private lives.

Currently, the dissenting judges’ claim that inferences drawn from thermal
imagery of Kyllo’s home were not an intrusion of his privacy but only the ‘police’s
thought processes’ and the government’s assertion that ‘the heat emitted from the
home’ is not private seem normal. In the Netherlands, heat detection from police
helicopters is not considered systematic government observation (Hennepadvocaat
2019) and thus constitutes legal proof. Our location and movement, tweets, emails,
photos and videos, purchases, our every click, misspelled word, and page view—
are routinely observed by government and big tech via mobile phones, surveillance
cameras, drones, satellites, street views, and corporate and government databases to
draw inferences that can control, predict and monetize our behavior. Siegel (2013)
notes that an individual’s data can be purchased for approximately half a cent, but
the average user’s value to the Internet advertising ecosystem is estimated at $1,200
per year. Wall Street values tech giants, not because of the services they provide but
for the data they collect from individuals and its worth to advertisers (Halpern 2013).
Ironically, these data may be emitted by millions of automated accounts, each sold

by obscure companies many times over, or celebrities, businesses or anyone desiring
to exert inﬂuence online, according to a New York Times investigation (Confessore
et al. 2018).
These facts have not escaped the public’s attention. The Snowden revelations
(Greenwald and MacAskill 2013) and the Cambridge Analytica scandal (The
Guardian 2018) were probably the biggest contributors to citizens’ changing per-
ceptions of privacy, though not in the way Zuckerberg predicted in 2010. People care
now more about privacy, and liberal governments responded accordingly. A 2018
survey by The Atlantic found that in the USA, “overall, 78.8 percent of people said
they were “very” or “somewhat” concerned about the privacy of their information on
social media, and 82.2 percent said they self-censor on social media” (Beck 2018).
In 2018, legislation was passed in Vermont to regulate data brokers and California
gave its residents the right to be informed about the kinds of personal information
companies have collected about them, as well as the right to request that their per-
sonal information be deleted. Colorado-based companies will be required to, among
other things, dispose of certain kinds of personally identifying information. The dif-
ferent types of information prone to compromise individual privacy are explained in
detail in Sect. 25.2. Overall, two thirds of Americans are now eager to see stricter
privacy laws (Halpern 2018). On May 25, 2018 the General Data Protection Regu-
lation (GDPR) came in force to protect individuals in the 28 member countries of
the European Union, even if their data is processed elsewhere. The GDPR applies to
publishers, banks, universities, most Fortune 500 companies, ad-tech companies and
the Silicon Valley tech giants. With the GDPR,“companies must be clear and concise
about their collection and use of personal data like full name, home address, loca-
tion data, IP address, or the identiﬁer that tracks web and app use on smartphones.
Companies have to spell out why the data is being collected and whether it will be
used to create proﬁles of people’s actions and habits. Moreover, consumers will gain
the right to access data companies store about them, the right to correct inaccurate
information, and the right to limit the use of decisions made by algorithms” (Tiku
2018).
Ethical issues arising in studies of our planet, as a system involving natural, man-
made and hybrid processes, are enmeshed with scientiﬁc or industrial practices.
Professional codes of ethics safeguard the public good by requiring honesty, trust
and fairness, and the avoidance of harm. Respect for privacy and other people’s work
addressesconcernsofintrusionandintellectualproperty.Studiesinvolvinggeospatial
information may be riddled with ethical ambiguity because professional responsibil-
ity requires acknowledging that the proposed methods may not travel well to other
geographies. In short, location is burdened with contextual speciﬁcs. If such speciﬁcs
are not parameterized, the earth sciences are vulnerable to the reproducibility crisis
(Baker 2016). Ethics in Digital Earth methods are thus fundamentally important to
study, and we expect open science approaches (Vicente-Saez and Martinez-Fuentes
2018) to mature in coming years and allow improvement of their methodical robust-
ness.
In this chapter, we contribute to the Ethics of Where in two ways. First, we focus on
information privacy, and location privacy, or (geo)privacy. This is necessary because
790
Y. Georgiadou et al.
information about an individual’s location is substantially different from other kinds
of personal information. The reasons for this include the ease of capturing an individ-
ual’s location, the improvement of a service when the user shares their location with
a service provider, and the potential to infer sensitive information about social, eco-
nomic or political behavior from location history (Keßler and McKenzie 2018). Data
inferred from an individual’s location are socially constructed. If a society considers
a given mode of personal behavior—e.g., political opinion, sexual orientation, reli-
gious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership—to be socially legitimate,
then these data are deemed personal and worthy of protection. We deﬁne privacy as a
positive right concerning “the claim of individuals to determine for themselves when,
how, and to what extent location information about them is communicated to others”
because control of location information is the central issue in location privacy (Duck-
ham and Kulik 2006, p. 36). Second, we complement other studies that describe the
current state of the art and formulate challenges (Keßler and McKenzie 2018; Zook
et al. 2017) or describe different scenarios concerning the development of geopri-
vacy (Wegener and Masser 1996) and revisit them (Masser and Wegener 2016) by
taking an interdisciplinary perspective. We draw from the ﬁeld of (geo)computing
to describe the transformation of volunteered, observed, and inferred information
(Sect. 25.2) and suggest privacy-preserving measures (Sect. 25.4). We draw from
organization studies to dissect privacy into some ideal types of social relationships
and strategies (Sect. 25.3), and draw from cultural theory to suggest future research
(Sect. 25.5). The ﬁnal section provides a brief overview of data protection legislation
on the African continent and in China as well as various global and regional ethics
guidelines.
We use the compound word (geo)privacy to suggest that, although control of loca-
tion information is the central issue, location can be inferred from people’s interests,
activities, and sociodemographics, not only from ‘traditional’ location information,
e.g., geographic coordinates (Keßler and McKenzie 2018). Further, we emphasize
the distinction between privacy as a negative right (freedom from interference) and
privacy as a positive right (freedom to control). This is because old, predigital tech-
nologies—such as the instantaneous photographs and newspaper tabloids in Brandeis
and Warren’s time—restricted individuals to claiming privacy as a negative right only,
as freedom from interference or ‘the right to be left alone’ (Warren and Brandeis
1890). New digital technologies can reduce or signiﬁcantly enhance privacy as a
positive right, i.e., the freedom to control (Floridi 2014), often in combination with
social and/or organizational and/or legal measures/strategies (Mulligan et al. 2016).
25.2
Transforming Volunteered and Observed Data
to Inferred Data
We distinguish three types of personal data: volunteered, observed and inferred data.
These new types replace the old, ‘personal, nonpersonal’ data distinction, which has
outlived its usefulness in the era of dataﬁcation. We deﬁne the three data types as
25
Digital Earth Ethics
791
suggested by the World Economic Forum (2011, p. 7): “Volunteered data are created
and explicitly shared by individuals, e.g. social network proﬁles. Observed data are
captured by recording the actions of individuals, e.g. location data when using cell
phones. Inferred data are data about individuals based on analysis of volunteered
or observed information, e.g. credit scores.” These three types involve both spatial
and nonspatial data. We deﬁne spatial data as data that includes explicit coordinates
interpretable in an open, well-known system. Examples are map coordinates, postal
codes and street addresses. We do not think of mobile cell tower numbers as spatial
data because special insight into the coding mechanism is required to understand
their location.
To explain how volunteered and/or observed spatial data can be transformed into
inferred data, we describe spatial data types with private or conﬁdential components
and provide examples of possible inference attacks on them. In principle, the subjects
of these data types can be humans, organizations, groups of people, animals, nonliv-
ing physical objects such as buildings, or other conﬁdential information with location
attributes. Here, we focus on individual humans as data subjects. Hence, we drop the
term ‘conﬁdentiality’ and focus on ‘privacy’ because data classiﬁed as conﬁdential
(e.g., health records) is also private at an individual level. Similarly, inferences or
inference attacks refer to private data that can be derived for each individual included
in a spatial dataset.
We deﬁne a key identiﬁer as an attribute that can be exploited with minimal effort
to identify a subject. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil-
ity Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, some common key identiﬁers are a person’s name,
telephone number, fax number, street address, electronic mail address, social secu-
rity number, vehicle license plate, device identiﬁer, biometric identiﬁer, facial image,
Internet protocol (IP) address, and web universal resource locator (URL) (U.S. Gov-
ernment Publishing Ofﬁce 2009). Other potential key identiﬁers are account names
on Internet platforms (e.g., in social media applications) and coordinate pairs of pri-
vate information (e.g., location of households). In some cases, a key identiﬁer links
private information to a single individual only for a subset of the data. For example,
in a dataset with locations of households, a small percentage corresponds to single-
family houses (or detached houses) with only one occupant. The key identiﬁer is a
direct identiﬁer for this subset. In other cases, a key identiﬁer links private infor-
mation to a small group of people closely related to the subject. This group may be
family members who become emotionally traumatized if their private information is
released or may be other house occupants that are incorrectly identiﬁed as the sub-
jects. In addition, we deﬁne a quasi-identiﬁer as an attribute that pinpoints a subject
uniquely or almost uniquely, when combined with at least one other quasi-identiﬁer
attribute. A unique identiﬁer (UID) is an attribute that allows for uniquely identifying
single subjects. In some cases, a UID can be a key identiﬁer (e.g., social security
number, which identiﬁes a subject), in others, its value may not be subject-speciﬁc,
for instance, if it identiﬁes a drug brand or a pharmaceutical factory process number,
which cannot be used to disclose private information. Finally, a private attribute is
any attribute that is not a key identiﬁer, a quasi-identiﬁer, or a UID, and contains
792
Y. Georgiadou et al.
other information about the subject from which inferences regarding privacy can be
drawn.
The above data typology focuses on the usefulness of spatial or non-spatial data
in inferences that affect privacy. Below, we discuss a second data typology that
characterizes the roles of spatial and temporal attributes.
The simplest spatial data type is ‘discrete location data’ (abbreviated Dd); it is
a collection of one or more key spatial identiﬁers. The disclosure of this data type
implies disclosure of subjects linked to the private information or to a small circle of
possible subjects for each key identiﬁer. Examples of Dd are the locations of domestic
violence events and addresses of cancer patients. In both these cases, subjects can
be identiﬁed as a person living at the disclosed location. As with all the data types
discussed here, we assume that the data holder can interpret the data because they are
aware of the contextual information that deﬁnes the search (e.g., “this is a collection
of addresses of cancer patients”).
A second data type is ‘discrete location data with covariates,’ hereafter referred to
as Dd + . The “+” symbol extends the notion of Dd by including additional attributes.
The additional attributes are one or more quasi-identiﬁers. Quasi-identiﬁers are
demographic, social, or economic attributes. A private attribute may or may not
be present. An example of Dd + is a crime dataset of locations of offences (key
identiﬁer), the age of the victim (quasi-identiﬁer), the ethnicity of the victim (quasi-
identiﬁer), and the type of the offence (private attribute). The location of offence is a
key identiﬁer, at least for that subset of the data collection where the type of offence
occurs predominantly in residential addresses.
An inference attack on Dd and Dd + data types aims to identify (or re-engineer)
the location of some subject(s). The data may not be disclosed but presented as a
printed or a digital map. Such media can be geoprocessed to re-engineer the locations
with considerable accuracy (Brownstein et al. 2006; Leitner et al. 2007). Multiple
anonymized copies of the data can be disclosed, accompanied by speciﬁcations of
the anonymization technique, for instance, for scientiﬁc transparency and repro-
ducibility. This can provide hints to the attacker and, depending on the strength of
the technique, locations can be re-engineered with the Gaussian blurring algorithm
(Cassa et al. 2008).
A third data type is ‘space-time data,’ hereafter referred to as STd. Data of this
type contains location and timestamps for one or more subjects, which can be dis-
tinguished with a UID. Each location represents or approximates where a subject
was at a particular time. Typical examples are call data records (CDR) and data used
in location-based services (LBS). Unless the identity of the subject is known (e.g.,
when UIDs are real names), there is no key identiﬁer or quasi-identiﬁer. Neverthe-
less, the subjects’ spatiotemporal whereabouts can be analyzed to draw a plethora
of inferences such as their home address, work address, time spent away from work,
and places visited during weekends (Alrayes and Abdelmoty 2014).
Gambs et al. (2010) analyzed GPS mobility traces of 90 taxi trails in San Fran-
cisco, US. They attempted to infer the home location of the drivers using a heuristic
approach of the ﬁrst and last recorded locations during working days. However, they
did not have validation data to assess the accuracy of their approach. De Montjoye
25
Digital Earth Ethics
793
et al. (2013) focused on the uniqueness of spatiotemporal trajectories and analyzed
mobility data from mobile phone interactions (calls and messengers) for approx-
imately 1.5 million people. They found that four random locations are enough to
uniquely characterize 95% of mobile users for a sample in which the location of
a user is speciﬁed hourly, with a spatial resolution equal to that determined by the
carrier’s antennas.
The fourth and last data type is the ‘space-time-attribute’ data, hereafter referred
to as STd + . As with Dd + , the “+” symbol denotes an extended version of STd, which
includes additional attributes that can be quasi-identiﬁers or private attributes. An
example of STd + is the georeferenced data of a Twitter user. Twitter data contains
spatial and temporal information as well as the short message text posted by the
user. Inferences can be made similar to those for STd. Additionally, the textual or
otherwise semantic information may reveal private matters about the sender such
as interests, beliefs, and attitudes. For instance, Preo¸tiuc-Pietro and Cohn (2013)
exploited the primary venue type in Foursquare check-ins (i.e., professional and
other, travel and transport, residence, food, nightlife spots, university, outdoors, arts
and entertainment, and shop and service) to cluster users by behavioral patterns and
estimate their next activity based on the history of past venue visits. In another real-
word but small-scale study, LBS network data of university volunteers was analyzed
based on location similarity. Inferences were made to predict the users’ demographics
such as education level and gender (Li et al. 2018).
Participatory sensing data are data collected by volunteers, mainly for research,
using mobile sensors such as biometric bracelets, smartwatches or smartphones.
They include data from mobile devices such as sensors carried by ‘humans as sensor
operators,’ sensors carried by ‘humans as objective sensors,’ and devices carried by
‘humans as subjective sensors’ (Kounadi and Resch 2018). Participatory sensing data
are the STd + type. For example, participants in a participatory research campaign
may use mobile apps that track their space-time information and report their level
of stress (i.e., sensitive information) throughout their activity spaces (Zeile et al.
2011). In participatory sensing data, private attributes are observed or volunteered
geoinformation whereas private attributes are also inferred geoinformation in LBS
network data. Thus, due to the error of the inference process, the disclosure risk of
LBS network data may be lower than that of participatory sensing data.
The four types of spatial data are illustrated in Fig. 25.1, where:
• S1…k is the spatial attribute such as the coordinates, postal codes, or street
addresses;
• T1…n is the temporal attribute such as hour, date, or month; and
• A1…m are quasi-identiﬁers and/or private attributes.
All spatial data types include a spatial attribute. Two of the data types contain a
temporal attribute (STd and STd +) and two contain additional attributes (Dd + and
ST +).

A Typology for (Geo)Privacy
Privacy is always relational. It does not make sense for a lonely man on a desert
island. At its simplest, privacy relates two parties—a human to a human, a human
to a group of humans, a human to a private corporation or a human to a government
institution. Theserelations canbearrangedinatypologyof (geo)privacy(Table 25.1).
This grouping is a gross simpliﬁcation of reality. For instance, LBS involve no less
than thirteen human, machine and software parties—the mobile device, the hardware
manufacturer, the operating system, the operating system manufacturer, the mobile
application, the mobile application developer, the core application, the third-party
software, the third-party software developer, the LBS, the LBS provider, the network
operator and government (Herrmann 2016). Further, government institutions and
private corporations often cooperate. The National Security Agency obtained direct
access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US Internet giants as
part of the Prism program, which allows for ofﬁcials to collect material including
search history, the content of emails, ﬁle transfers and live chats (Greenwald and
MacAskill 2013). Nevertheless, the four ideal types of relations help create a rough
grid into which ﬁner resolution grids may be inserted in future iterations.
At the heart of the typology is Alice. We may imagine her as a member of ACM
who must comply with the ACM Code of Ethics or as a member of a (geo)computing
department at a European university, which must comply with the GDPR. Alice val-
ues (geo)privacy as a positive right, a right that obliges action by individuals, groups,

or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent informa-
tion about them is communicated to others (Westin 1967). To transfer from Westin’s
times to the information age, Alice values privacy as the positive right of individuals,
groups, or institutions “to control the life cycle (especially the generation, access,
recording, and usage) of their information and determine when, how, and to what
extent their information is processed by others” (Floridi 2014, p. 114). The relational-
ity of privacy highlights the possibility that the privacy goals of two binary parties can
be incongruous and results in the horizontal dimension of the typology in Table 25.1.
Incongruity can be low or high. The vertical dimension refers to Alice’s ability to
control the transformation process of her volunteered, observed or inferred informa-
tion or that of her research subjects. Her ability is high when she can control the entire
transformation process—the behavior of humans (incl. herself) and machines and
outputs. It is low when she can control some or none of these (Ouchi 1979; Ciborra
1985). Alice’s ability (low or high) to control the transformation process results in
the vertical dimension in Table 25.1.
In Cell (1), two humans (Alice and Bob) are interacting face-to-face in a private
or public space. This is the archetypal human-to-human interaction. Both Alice and
Bob are conscious of being observed by each other and other humans and have
similar privacy goals—to uphold a tacit social code, the ‘right and duty of partial
display.’ The sociologist Erving Goffman (1957) described how all humans reveal
personal information selectively to uphold this code while constructing their public
personae. Hence, the low incongruity between Alice’s and Bob’s goals to protect
their privacy—both strive to uphold this tacit social code, to protect (or curate) their
public personae, and modulate it gradually over time, as the relation expands or
shrinks. As Fried (1968) explains, Alice may not mind that Bob knows a general fact
about her but may feel her privacy is invaded if he knows the details. For instance,
Bob may comfortably know that Alice is sick, but it would violate her privacy if he
796
Y. Georgiadou et al.
knew the nature of the illness. If Bob is a good friend, he may know what particular
illness Alice is suffering from but it would violate her privacy if he were actually
to witness her suffering. Both control their behavior and the knowledge they share
(outputs) about each other and may choose to modulate them over time. Goffman’s
theory applies in settings where participants can see one another face-to-face and
has implications for technology-mediated interactions, e.g., in email security (Agre
and Rotenberg 1997). When emailing each other, Alice and Bob may choose from a
continuum of strategies to safeguard their privacy depending on context. They may
refrain from emailing, they may email each other but self-censor, they may delegate
privacy protection to mail encryption and ﬁrewalls, or they can work socially and
organizationally to ensure that members of their community understand and police
norms about privacy (Bowker et al. 2010).
Cell (2) describes the interaction of a human, e.g., Alice, the research leader of a
participatory sensing campaign, with a group of campaign participants (Bob, Carol,
Dan, Eric, etc.).
The goal incongruity between Alice and the group may be high if the group
members are not aware of possible breaches to their privacy and their implications.
As campaign leader, Alice has a high ability to control outputs and the behaviors of
group members and machines and takes a series of privacy-preserving measures for
the entire group before, during and after the campaign, a strategy Kounadi and Resch
(2018) call ‘geoprivacy by design.’ Kounadi and Resch (2018) propose detailed
privacy-preserving measures in four categories, namely, 6 measures prior to the start
of a research survey, 4 measures for ensuring secure and safe settings, 9 measures
for processing and analysis of collected data, and 24 measures for safe disclosure of
datasets and research deliverables. Table 25.2 provides illustrative examples in each
category. Interestingly, measures to control human behavior include two subtypes:
Table 25.2 Examples of measures that control the transformation process

human behavior (participation agreement, informed consent,
institutional approval); outputs (deﬁned criteria of access to

information, using disclaimers, avoiding the release of multiple
versions of anonymized data, avoiding the disclosure of
anonymization metadata, planning a mandatory licensing
agreement, authenticating data requestors)
25
Digital Earth Ethics
797
outreach measures, e.g., participation agreements, and measures of self-restraint,
e.g., the use of disclaimers, avoiding release.
Cell (3) describes the interaction of Alice with a private corporation, as a user of
a location-based service, of which Google Maps is the most popular and commonly
used. Alice volunteers her locationtotheLBStoget directions toadesireddestination
(Herrmann 2016). In this case, the goal incongruity between Google and Alice is
high, as evident from comparing Alice’s commitment to (geo)privacy with that of
Google’s former executive chair Eric Schmidt. “If you have something that you don’t
want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the ﬁrst place” (Newman
2009). Alice’s ability to control how her location information is used by LBS to infer
other information about her is low. As an EU citizen, she can rely on the GDPR
to (partly) control the behavior of the LBS provider. Another strategy is lodging a
complaint to her national Data Protection Authority (DPA). DPAs are independent
public authorities in each EU state that supervise application of the GDPR and handle
complaints lodged concerning violations of GDPR. If the private corporation where
Alice works systematically monitors its employees, including their workstations and
Internet activity, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may be required.
Cell (4) describes the interaction of Alice with government institutions. Alice
trusts that her government will respect her right to information privacy (thus the
goal incongruity is low) but may be in the dark regarding the transformation process
unless a whistleblower leaks a secret surveillance program (e.g., Greenwald and
MacAskill 2013) or the abuse of private data (The Guardian 2018). Further, if the
public organization where Alice works engages in processing that is likely to result
in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, Alice may lodge a complaint
to the DPA and request a DPIA. Such processing may include the systematic and
extensive evaluation of personal aspects of an individual, including proﬁling, the
processing of sensitive data on a large scale, or the systematic monitoring of public
areas on a large scale.
Another strategy for Alice is collective, e.g., participating in popular resistance to
unpopular government action. When the government of the Federal Republic of Ger-
many announced a national census on 27th April 1983, German citizens protested so
strongly that a dismayed German government had to comply with the Federal Con-
stitutional Court’s order to stop the process and take into account several restrictions
imposed by the Court in future censuses. Asking the public for personal informa-
tion in 1983, the ﬁftieth anniversary of the National Socialists’ ascent to power, was
apparently bad timing, to say the least (Der Spiegel 1983). When the census was
ﬁnally conducted in 1987, thousands of citizens boycotted (overt resistance) or sab-
otaged (covert resistance) what they perceived as Orwellian state surveillance (Der
Spiegel 1987).
Notably, these remarkable events took place in an era where the government
was the only legitimate collector of data at such a massive, nationwide scale and
at a great cost (approx. one billion German marks). Currently, state and corporate
surveillance are deeply entangled. In response, technologically savvy digital rights
activists have been inﬂuential in several venues, including the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
798
Y. Georgiadou et al.
(ICANN), through the Noncommercial User Constituency (NCUC) caucus. How-
ever, their efforts have largely remained within a community of technical experts
(‘tech justice’) with little integration with ‘social justice’ activists (Dencik et al.
2016).

Measures to Preserve Geoprivacy
In Sect. 25.2, we characterized various data types that deserve speciﬁc scrutiny when
privacyis concerned. This characterizationwas motivatedbytheperspectiveof avari-
ety of attackers’ strategies (either theoretically possible or practically realized) to
identify private information on a subject. Below, we describe geoprivacy-preserving
measures to counter such attacks. Section 25.3 highlighted the relationality of privacy
and described the four fundamental relations that are critical to understanding privacy
as a societal phenomenon. In real life, the social graph is not bipartite and humans
cannot be bluntly labeled as either ‘attacked’ or ‘attacker’. Relations are often tran-
sitive and privacy-relevant information may travel along longer paths, which implies
that intermediate agents may have dual, possibly frictional, roles. One rather regu-
lated, yet much-discussed case, is that of patients whose hospital visits are covered
by health insurance companies. Geoprivacy may be related to the living or working
conditions of the patient. The patient’s typical direct relation with the insurance com-
pany does not make this case less trivial. A second example that played out recently
in the Netherlands was that of a citizen with a tax dispute, and the national museum
foundation that had issued an annual pass to that person (van Lieshout 2018). The
tax ofﬁce accessed the person’s museum visit details to prove that he actually lived
in the Netherlands, and not abroad, as he claimed.
To identify core geoprivacy measures, we must deﬁne the landscape of variables
and the values they take, and explore their interrelationships. Six fundamental vari-
ables are discussed below, along with their values, and are summarized in Table 25.3.
The ﬁrst variable is the ‘attacked’, who is any subject in a dataset that may be harmed
from potential inferences. The attacked is an individual such as Alice—i.e., aware
of privacy risks and subscribing to the ACM code of Ethics—or someone who is
unaware of privacy risks and relevant legislation and regulations. The second vari-
able is the ‘attacker’, who could use the data for a malevolent purpose. The attacker
may be a government institution, corporation, researcher, or other individual. The
third variable is the ‘data type’, any of the four types discussed in Sect. 25.2 (i.e.,
Dd, Dd+, STd, or STd +). The fourth variable is the ‘purpose of attack’, which may
assume two values: (a) private attribute(s) of the attacked are identiﬁed (attribute(s)
is unknown but the attacked is known) and (b) the attacked who has certain private
attribute(s) is identiﬁed (attacked is unknown but the attribute(s) is known). In attacks
of the ﬁrst category, the attacker knows that the attacked’s details are contained in
a dataset and the attacker aims to draw inferences on the attacked. In those of the
second category, the attacker knows the private information and aims to infer the
identity of the attacked.

We have used terminology from Sects. 25.2 and 25.3 to deﬁne four of the six
fundamental variables. Two more variables in the geoprivacy landscape are discussed
next. The ﬁfth is the ‘attacker’s strategy’ (also referred to as “inference attacks”)
that can take seven forms: (a) key-identiﬁer exploitation, (b) combine to uniqueness,
(c) re-engineering locations, (d) analyzing locations, (e) homogeneity attack, (f)
background attack, and (g) composition attack.
The simplest type of inference is key-identiﬁer exploitation. It requires the pres-
ence of key identiﬁers in the dataset. The accuracy of such inferences range from low
to high depending on the relationship type that the data represents (i.e., one-to-many
or one-to-one). For example, a location representing a block of ﬂats links it to many
households (and even more people) whereas an address in a single-family residen-
tial area only links the location to a small number of family members. Other key
identiﬁers represent a strict one-to-one relationship (e.g., a ﬁngerprint or iris scan).
Datasets collected by a governmental institution are more likely to contain such key
identiﬁers, while subjects such as Alice have little control over the inferences that
the institution can draw about them.
Individuals may be identiﬁed if the data comprise a combination of quasi-
identiﬁers in the dataset that allows for the unique identiﬁcation of subjects (i.e.,
combine to uniqueness). Unlike pseudonyms, quasi-identiﬁers are real attributes
such as sex and age, which can be further processed or linked to external data to
800
Y. Georgiadou et al.
disclose the subject’s identity. Such disclosure may occur if hospitals share their
medical records with governmental institutions such as a country’s census bureau
(Cell (4) relation). A hypothetical Dd + contains attributes such as the date of visit,
age, gender, occupation, municipality of residence, and ﬁnal diagnosis. A data ana-
lyst from the census bureau can identify a unique combination of quasi-identiﬁers
in which there is a visitor diagnosed with a given disease who is male, lives in a
known municipality, and has a known professional occupation. The combination of
such facts in a certain municipality may lead to unique subject identiﬁcation with a
simple Internet search. However, only a fraction of the subjects may be identiﬁed in
this way.
As explained in Sect. 25.2, in examples regarding Dd and Dd +, re-engineering
of locations is performed using geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques. When
these locations represent private information, re-engineering of location implies iden-
tiﬁcation of the attacked. For example, a researcher publishes a map of the distribution
of pregnant teenagers in a study area as dots on a map (a Cell (2) relation). The map
is georeferenced to a known coordinate system, and the dots are digitized as circles.
Then, the centroid of each circle can be extracted as a single location. Geocoding
can be used to reveal the addresses of the studied teenagers.
The analysis of locations of individuals may yield various inferences including
the location of their home, which is a key identiﬁer for a data subject. When key
identiﬁers are inferred or re-engineered, the risk of identiﬁcation is typically lower
than when the key identiﬁer is available in the dataset because of possible errors and
inaccuracy in the inferencing processes. For example, an LBS stores the time and
location of all user service requests (a Cell (3) relation). An attacker who has access
to data on service requests may wish to infer the home locations of the users. First,
the attacker excludes all service requests during working hours and weekends and
splits the dataset by user. The remaining datasets represent sets of possible home
locations for each user—requests sent at night and during weekdays, where people
are more likely to be at home. The following analysis may be repeated for each
user separately: (a) apply spatial clustering and identify the cluster with the highest
density and (b) extract the point with the smallest accumulated distance to all other
points (i.e., a point set centroid) within the highest density cluster. The extracted
point is inferred as the home location of the user.
Anonymized data may disclose information if they yield homogeneous groups of
subjects regarding their private attributes. This strategy is referred to as a homogeneity
attack and requires that a dataset (either in its current form or after processing)
includes a private attribute of categorical or ratio scale. For example, a researcher
collects Twitter data during a three-month period (a Cell 2 relation). The home
location of subjects is estimated using spatial analysis and the subjects’ political
preference (i.e., a categorical private attribute) is inferred using natural language
processing and machine learning techniques. The researcher publishes the dataset in
anonymized form, aggregating the home locations to zip code, including the political
preference, and excluding all Twitter-relevant information (e.g., account names). An
attacker knows a subject who uses Twitter frequently and where this person lives.
However, all records associated with the zip code of the subject display a single
25
Digital Earth Ethics
801
political preference. Thus, that subject’s political preference is disclosed due to a
lack of diversity in the private attribute.
A background attack is possible when an attacker has knowledge (in the form
of background information) on the distribution of a private attribute. For instance,
mobile operators collect call data records that contain the location, time and a user
identiﬁer for each call (a random UID distinguishes users) (a Cell (3) relation). The
operator can apply spatiotemporal analytics to infer the most visited venue during
weekends for each subject. Anonymized copies of the data may be shared with
another corporation for advertising purposes. The operator may have aggregated
subject home locations by zip code (the home location is already known to the
operator because of contract information), and may include visited venues during
weekends in addition to other information. An attacker from the corporation knows
that a subject is in the dataset and may know their home address. In the records of
the zip code of the known person, it is possible that four different restaurants are
revealed as frequently visited. The attacker knows that due to the subject’s religion,
three out of the four restaurants are unlikely. Thus, private information about the user
is disclosed using background information.
The term composition attack refers to a privacy breach that occurs when exploiting
independent anonymized datasets from different sources that involve overlapping
subject populations (Ganta et al. 2008). A composition attack may build on the
attacker’s knowledge about a subject or the distribution of the private attribute and
relies on the existence of further sources of auxiliary information. For example, in
the mobile operator case, a subject may visit only two restaurants due to their eating
habits. The data may have been anonymized to include the zip code and the most
visited venues during weekends. Because the attacker also possesses Foursquare
check-in data and knows that the subject is a frequent Foursquare user, they can
search the venue results within the subject’s zip code. There may be six distinct
venues in the second dataset but only one appears in both datasets for the same zip
code, and so the most visited venue by the attacked during weekends is disclosed.
The sixth variable is the ‘privacy-preserving measures’ that mitigate an attack
strategy by controlling the ﬁnal digital outputs (Table 25.3). Data holders with full
control of the transformation process may apply various privacy-preserving mea-
sures. Alice, as a sophisticated attacked, should consider the attacker’s strategies and
the privacy-preserving measures and intervene in her outputs by controlling, blur-
ring, or censoring her digital behavior. The degree to which this is possible depends
on her ability to control the transformation process (see Table 25.1). Next, we discuss
ﬁve measures at her disposal, namely, (a) pseudonymity, (b) k-anonymity, (c) spatial
k-anonymity, (d) l-diversity, and (e) differential privacy.
Pseudonymity is the use of pseudonyms as identiﬁers (or as key identiﬁers) (Pﬁtz-
mann and Köhntopp 2001). Unlinked pseudonyms are fake identities associated with
data subjects. A pseudonym can be used to permit a subject’s distinguishability, such
as a UID as a random number. If distinguishability is not needed, given the use forms
of the data, all key identiﬁers should be removed. However, if we consider that the
attacker can apply strategies beyond key identiﬁer exploitation, such as combine to
uniqueness, pseudonymity mitigates but does not eliminate disclosure risk. Combine
802
Y. Georgiadou et al.
to uniqueness can be prevented with k-anonymity, which ensures that any subject is
a member of a group of size k with the same values of the quasi-identiﬁers (Samarati
and Sweeney 1998). Thus, a key-identiﬁer exploitation attack is mitigated by a k level
of anonymity. The larger the k, the more difﬁcult it is to identify a subject.
A similar measure to k-anonymity is spatial k-anonymity, in which a location
cannot be distinguished among k-1 other locations. This can mitigate the risk from
analyzing locations, and its application varies depending on the data type. For exam-
ple, to prevent re-engineering from a Dd, every location should be an approximation
of k locations (such as residential addresses) within an area. In this case, randomly
displacing residential addresses based on some uniform distribution is preferable over
a normal distribution because the latter may provide hints to potential attackers (see
Sect. 25.2). To prevent the inference of home locations from an STd, each subject’s
location should ambiguously map information to at least k other subjects for every
moment in time. This approach can be done by decreasing the spatial resolution.
Machanavajjhala et al. (2006) showed that k-anonymity mitigates but does not
prevent identiﬁcation due to homogeneity and background attacks. The authors pro-
posed the l-diversity privacy measure, which requires a k-anonymous dataset to have
at least l ‘well-represented’ values for the private attributes in each equivalence class.
The characteristic l is the minimum number of times a value of a private attribute
appears in a dataset. The last measure is differential privacy, which guarantees that
any disclosure from the data does not change signiﬁcantly due to the absence or pres-
ence of a subject in the database (Dwork 2006). Differential privacy returns answers
to aggregate queries and, according to Ganta et al. (2008), certain variations of the
measure may satisfy conditions to prevent composition attacks.
25.5
Toward a Sociocultural Understanding of Privacy
In the previous sections, we explored the Ethics of Where from the point of view of
Alice, an individual complying with the ACM Code of Ethics and/or the rules of a
GDPR-compliant European university. Alice’s technological sophistication enables
her to control (part of) the transformation process (from volunteered/observed to
inferred information) and preserve her privacy from attackers (Table 25.3), as well
as the privacy of her research subjects (Table 25.2). Her knowledge of GDPR legis-
lation reassures her that the behavior of corporations and government institutions is
controlled by law and enforced by sanctions. GDPR instruments (e.g., DPIA) enable
her to lodge complaints to preserve her privacy as a private or public sector employee.
She may tackle perceived privacy breaches of the data protection legislation by alert-
ing her representative in the legislature, by joining a collective movement of peaceful
protest or by bringing a case of privacy violation to a court of law, as in Kyllo v. United
States.
In the future, we should tackle privacy at the sociocultural level, starting from a
basic premise in social theory, as Alice’s (privacy) preferences and commitments are
shaped by and shape the culture of her community and society (Georgiadou et al.
25
Digital Earth Ethics
803
2019). Her individual preferences and the culture—i.e., the shared beliefs, attitudes,
way of life, or world view—of the community or society in which she is socialized
are deeply enmeshed and mutually reinforcing, and there is no way to determine the
dependent and independent variables. This means that we should consider privacy a
social construction to account for the substantial differences in social organization in
countries around the world, each with different preferred ways of social organizing
and different attitudes to privacy. We may distinguish four ideal types of social orga-
nizing—individualist, hierarchist, egalitarian, or fatalistic (Douglas and Wildavsky
1983). Each type is supported by (and supports) a ‘cultural bias’: a compatible pat-
tern of perceiving, justifying, and reasoning about nature, human nature, justice, risk,
blame, and privacy. These ideal types do not exist in unadulterated form, but can help
us identify which hybrids may be most effective in which institutional settings, and
how these hybrids change over time.
Individualiststendtoframeinformationprivacyasaproductthatcanbeexchanged
in the marketplace for a fair price. An excellent recent example of this approach is
the advocacy of the GenerationLibre think tank (Laurent 2018) to extend the private
property paradigm to personal data. GenerationLibre aspires to change the way the
digital ecosystem works by giving user-producers: “(1) The possibility for e-citizens
to negotiate and conclude contracts with the platforms (possibly via intermediaries)
regarding the use of their personal data, so that they can decide for themselves
which use they wish to make of them; (2) The ability to monetise these data (or not)
according to the terms of the contract (which could include licensing, leasing, etc.);
(3)The ability, conversely, to pay the price of the service provided by the platforms
without giving away our data (the price of privacy?)” (p. 7).
Hierarchists may be willing to surrender some of their privacy to a legal/rational
authority (e.g., government) they trust in exchange for another public good they
value, e.g., security or economic growth. The Chairperson of the German Social
Democratic Party (SPD), Andrea Nahles (2018), framed the problem: “Empires like
Google and Amazon cannot be beaten from below. No start-up can compete with
their data power and cash. If you are lucky, one of the big Internet whales will
swallow your company. If you are unlucky, your ideas will be copied.” Her solution
is a Data-for-all law: “The dividends of the digital economy must beneﬁt the whole
society. An important step in this direction: we [the state] must set limits to the
internet giants if they violate the principles of our social market economy. […] A
new data-for-all law could offer decisive leverage: As soon as an Internet Company
achieves a market share above a ﬁxed threshold for a certain time period, it will be
required to share a representative, anonymized part of their data sets with the public.
With this data other companies or start-ups can develop their own ideas and bring
their own products to the market place. In this setting the data are not “owned”
exclusively by e.g. Google, but belong to the general public.” However, as Morozov
(2018) argues, Nahles’ agenda “needs to overcome a great obstacle: citizens’ failing
trust in the state as a vehicle of advancing their interests,” especially in a country
such as Germany with a long history of data privacy activism.
Morozov (2018) argues for an egalitarian approach to privacy as constitutive of
who we are and as radical citizen empowerment. “We should not balk at proposing
804
Y. Georgiadou et al.
ambitious political reforms to go along with their new data ownership regime. These
must openly acknowledge that the most meaningful scale at which a radical change
in democratic political culture can occur today is not the nation state, as some
on the left and the right are prone to believe, but, rather the city. The city is a
symbol of outward-looking cosmopolitanism–a potent answer to the homogeneity
and insularity of the nation state. Today it is the only place where the idea of exerting
meaningful democratic control over one’s life, however trivial the problem, is still
viable.” Similarly, the Oxford-based Digital Rights to the City group proposes a
deeper meaning to the right to information that amounts to the declaration that “we
will no longer let our information be produced and managed for us [presumably by
the state or corporations], we will produce and manage our information ourselves”
(Shaw and Graham 2017). Fatalists are those persuaded by the abovementioned
slogans “you have zero privacy…get over it” or “if you have something that you
don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the ﬁrst place.”
However, as Snowden said, “arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy
because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about
free speech because you have nothing to say” (Reddit 2015).
25.6
Toward Digital Earth Ethics: The Ethics of Where
In the previous sections, we mentioned privacy arrangements in the legal systems
of two polities—the United States and the European Union—a serious limitation
in a chapter on Digital Earth Ethics that encompasses the entire planet. However,
it is possible to see how privacy is dealt with differently in these two cases. The
word privacy is not mentioned in the US Constitution except indirectly in the Fourth
Amendment, which protects the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. In contrast, in the
European Union, privacy is a human right according to Article 8 of the European
Convention on Human Rights: a “right to respect for private and family life, home
and correspondence.” This is largely due to the events around World War II, where
personal information was often used to target individuals and groups and facilitate
genocide. In 2018, we witnessed a serious shake-up of the treatment of privacy, data
protection, and cybersecurity by legal systems around the world. The EU’s GDPR,
put in place in 2018, is a landmark development for privacy and how we perceive it.
In this transitional period, a number of countries seem to follow a similar pathway
as the GDPR: for instance, Canada, Japan, and India are looking at comparable
extraterritorial privacy regimes. A common denominator between them is privacy as
a constitutional right. Similar legislative developments are manifesting in China and
the African continent.
In China, the Cybersecurity Law, the most important Internet legislation to be
passed in the country thus far, came into effect on June 1, 2017. The law is intended
to align China with global best practices for cybersecurity. Network operators must
store select data within China and Chinese authorities may conduct spot-checks on
25
Digital Earth Ethics
805
a company’s network operations. “The Cybersecurity Law provides citizens with an
unprecedented amount of protection to ensure their data privacy. The law deﬁnes
“personal information” as information that can be used on its own or in conjunction
with other information to determine the identity of a natural person, including but not
limited to a person’s name, birthday, identity card number, biological identiﬁcation
information, address, and telephone number. In other words, once such information is
de-identiﬁed, it will no longer be subject to the requirement for personal information
in the Cybersecurity Law” (Lee 2018, p. 87). Other countries such as Korea and
Singapore are less decided and may be consciously delaying their legislative moves
until the scene becomes clearer.
In the African continent, approximately 40% of the countries have enacted data
protection legislation that abides the OECD standards (1st generation), the EU DPD
1995 standards (2nd generation), or even features GDPR elements (3rd generation).
The latter refers to Mauritius, one of Africa’s dynamic but small economies, which
updated its 2004 law in 2017 with a new Data Protection Act 2017 featuring ele-
ments of the GDPR. In June 2014, the African Union (AU) adopted the Convention
on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, known as the Malabo Convention,
the ﬁrst treaty outside the EU to regulate the protection of personal data at a continen-
tal level. The Convention aims to establish regional and national legal frameworks
for cybersecurity, electronic transactions and personal data protection, but its actual
impact will depend on ratiﬁcations, which had not occurred by early 2016. In 2018,
the AU created data protection guidelines that are broadly aligned with the GDPR
for its Member States, with contributions from regional and global privacy experts
including industry privacy specialists, academics and civil society groups (Geor-
giadou et al. 2019). On a global scale, there is a substantial imbalance in sensitive
data ﬂows, with mostly American Internet tech companies sourcing data globally.
This imbalance is the substrate for a continuation of developments in technology, the
legal scenery and contractual arrangements that we do not expect to be settled soon.
Unfortunately, privacy and data protection as global goods intersect with cyberse-
curity and counterterrorism, which gives little hope for transparency and focus on
solutions. Nevertheless, we should follow these developments closely (Raul 2018).
In addition to legislative efforts, global and regional institutions are busy develop-
ing ethical principles and guidelines. The UNESCO Declaration of Ethical Principles
in relation to Climate Change addresses the responsibility to overcome the challenges
and reinforces ethics at the center of the discussion on climate change. Member states
have mandated UNESCO with promoting ethical science: science that shares the ben-
eﬁts of progress for all, protects the planet from ecological collapse and creates a solid
basis for peaceful cooperation. The Global Ethics Observatory (GEObs), a system
of databases with worldwide coverage in bioethics and environmental ethics, science
ethics, and technology ethics, helps researchers identify Who’s Who in Ethics, Ethics
Institutions, Ethics Teaching Programs, Ethics-Related Legislation and Guidelines,
Codes of Conduct and Resources in Ethics. Other global actors in the responsible
data movement, e.g., UN Global Pulse (2017), Red Cross/Red Crescent 510 (2018)
and UNOCHA (2019), also develop data ethics guidelines as a cornerstone of their
groundwork.
806
Y. Georgiadou et al.
At the European Union level, the High-Level Expert Group on Artiﬁcial Intel-
ligence (AI HLEG) proposed the ﬁrst draft AI ethics guidelines to the European
Commission in December 2018. These cover issues such as fairness, safety, trans-
parency, the future of work, democracy and the impacts of application of the Charter
of Fundamental Rights, including privacy and personal data protection, dignity, con-
sumer protection and nondiscrimination. The European Group on Ethics in Science
and New Technologies (EGE) provides the Commission with high-quality, indepen-
dent advice on ethical aspects of science and new technologies in relation to EU
legislation or policies. The EGE is an independent advisory body founded in 1991
and is tasked with integrating ethics at the international level, at the interinstitutional
level with the European Parliament and the Council, and within the Commission
itself. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is the EU’s cen-
ter of fundamental rights expertise. It helps ensure that the fundamental rights of
people living in the EU are protected. Fundamental rights set minimum standards to
ensure that a person is treated with dignity. The Agency seeks to instill a fundamental
rights culture across the EU by collecting pertinent and timely data and information,
by sharing evidence-based insights and advice with policy- and decision-makers,
by raising rights awareness and promoting fundamental rights through cutting-edge
communications, and by engaging with a wide array of diverse stakeholders from
local and international levels.
However, requiring global and regional guidelines and principles to conceptualize
ethics and privacy across diverse cultural and political contexts and to substitute for
lacking or existing weakly enforced legislation (Taylor 2017) may further deplete
local institutional capacity and harm citizens. The question of how to improve dig-
ital data ﬂows between local and global institutions while maximizing the use of
innovative geospatial technologies and protecting citizens’ rights as well as local
institutions is particularly relevant in view of the increasing use of artiﬁcial geospa-
tial intelligence, mobile technology and social media to extract information about
individuals and communities.
Finally, legal and social strategies and privacy-preserving technological measures
should form the backbone of university curricula for students and working profes-
sionals. The advent of the GDPR in 2018 created a sudden educational demand for
university courses, of which the massive open online course (MOOC) ‘Privacy by
Design and GDPR’, designed by computer scientists at Karlstad University in Swe-
den, is a recent EU-focused example (Fischer-Hübner et al. 2018). The educational
challenge is to gradually expand the content of such courses for a global audience of
students from countries with emergent privacy and data protection legal frameworks,
different understandings of privacy and different social organization as well as dif-
ferent levels of technological sophistication in countering privacy attacks, because
The Ethics of Where should eventually be everywhere.

Digital Earth Challenges and Future
Trends
John van Genderen, Michael F. Goodchild, Huadong Guo, Chaowei Yang,
Stefano Nativi, Lizhe Wang and Cuizhen Wang
Abstract The previous 25 chapters introduced relevant technologies, applications,
and other topics related to Digital Earth. Respective challenges and future research
were also proposed by various authors. In this concluding chapter, we brieﬂy review
Digital Earth past and present, followed by a set of challenges and future trends,
speculating on how Digital Earth may evolve over the coming years. Such challenges
and trends are discussed in the context of science drivers, technological advances,
application adoption, and relevant virtual—physical community building.

California Science Center in 1998 (Gore 1998). And then the First International
Symposium on Digital Earth was held in Beijing in 1999 (ISDE 1999). Since then,
the symposium has been held every two years, and the International Society of Digital
Earth (ISDE) registered in Beijing in 2006. With the establishment of the Society,
rapid progress was made. The Society launched the International Journal of Digital
Earth (IJDE) in 2008, and this journal was accepted by the Science Citation Index
after only 18 months of existence. Started as a quarterly journal, it is now published
twelve times a year, with almost 100 scientiﬁc papers being published per year. The
Big Earth Data open-access journal was also established in 2017 to further advance
the data aspect of Digital Earth. Now the Society organizes, besides its ﬂagship event
of the biannual symposium, a series of summits, which focus on a narrower set of
topics and issues. The Society has now established several national and regional
chapters and a national committee around the world, and more will no doubt follow
over the coming years. Moreover, ISDE has become a Participating Organization
Member of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and an Afﬁliated Member of
theInternationalScienceCouncil(ISC)since2009and2017,respectively.AlsoISDE
has been accepted as a new member of the United Nations Committee of Experts
on Global Geospatial Information Management—Geospatial Societies (UN-GGIM
GS) in August 2019.
By analyzing the Google and Web of Science (SCI-E) academic indexing systems,
we found that: a) Google Scholar has indexed ~20,000 publications since 1992 on
“Digital Earth” with a steady annual increase, and b) a more restrictive search of the
Web of Science using “Digital Earth” as the topic and as all ﬁelds returned values
of 553 (left of Fig. 26.1) and 6669 (right of Fig. 26.1), respectively (as of May 26,
2019). Publication numbers jumped during 2008−2010 when IJDE was ofﬁcially
launched and when it received the ﬁrst SCI-E impact factor. The diversity of research

activities is reﬂected in the worldwide distribution, which has engaged all developed
countries and many developing countries, with the U.S. and China as the top-tier
contributors (Fig. 26.1). The collaboration between different countries also signiﬁes
the internationalization of the Digital Earth effort.
In the remainder of this chapter, we will look at a selection of the major challenges
the Society will face, plus we shall do some crystal-ball gazing, and speculate on
some of the major new trends in Digital Earth research over the coming years.
26.2
Major Challenges for Digital Earth
26.2.1
Big Data Management in Digital Earth
In discussing the challenges highlighted in earlier chapters of this manual, the authors
have demonstrated the tremendous volume, variety, veracity, and velocity (the four
Vs) challenges for Big Earth Data (Guo et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2017). The four Vs
impose new requirements on computing, data management, information extraction,
and knowledge discovery, as well as the detection of events of interest, needed to
realize the value (the ﬁfth V) of Big Earth Data for Earth science and applications
(Guo et al. 2014; Lee and Kang 2015; Shu 2016;Yang et al. 2019).
According to Filchev et al. (2018), up to 95% of the Earth observation (EO) data
present in existing archives has never been accessed, so the potential for increasing
exploitation is very large. Many satellite agencies are now changing their data archive
holdings to cloud-based or hybrid storage. Maintaining the balance of cost, usage,
transmission, and analytical services in the cloud is quite a challenge (Yang et al.
2017).
In the new era of Big Earth Data, geoscience can only achieve its full potential
through the fusion of diverse Earth observations and socio-economic data, together
with additional information from a vast range of sources. Such data sources include
observations obtained at different spectral and spatiotemporal resolutions, and obser-
vations from different platforms (e.g., satellite and in situ), orbits, and sensors, the
Internet of Things, and also unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) (Pohl and van
Genderen 2014). Fusion, given the variety, veracity, and velocity challenges of the
data, is only possible with well-designed architectures, reference systems, and stan-
dards. Hence, image and data fusion methods will require new and creative solutions
to meet the needs of the next generation of Digital Earth, where social science aspects
such as volunteered information, citizen science (public participation in scientiﬁc
research), etc., will need to be fused with Earth observation data from space, air,
ground, and subsurface (Pohl and van Genderen 2017). There are still many issues to
be resolved ﬁrst, such as how to ensure that data found in multiple data systems agree
with one another. Accuracy of the data and information, currency, and reliability are
all aspects likely to be investigated over the coming years in this ﬁeld of image, data,
and information fusion.
814
J. van Genderen et al.
A major challenge for the next generation of Digital Earth is that of common
standards for transforming the increasingly massive amounts of data (Bermudez
2017). The new Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) speciﬁcation of the Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provides a concrete way of addressing this challenge,
but only addresses the spatial aspect; how the other aspects of orbits, sensors, and
spectral and temporal resolution should be standardized still presents a challenge.
These issues may demonstrate a path forward towards the realization of the “Digital
Twin”—where our engagement and understanding of the physical Earth can seam-
lessly interact with the Digital Earth, and vice versa (see 5.1 in Chap. 2). Flexible
solutions are also needed in the area of the Internet of Things (IoT) for, whilst many
government and private organizations are starting to implement IoT solutions, devel-
oping an appropriate vision where things will work together, seamlessly and reliably
is still a huge challenge (see Chap. 11).
As detailed in Chaps. 6 and 9, addressing the four Vs of Big Earth Data in order
to obtain actionable information for end users is computationally intensive (Yang
et al. 2008). Utilizing cutting-edge computing is desirable, and how to coordinate
the process is a signiﬁcant challenge. Cloud computing has been adopted in the
past few years to address challenges and relevant issues (Yang and Huang 2013).
GPU, MPI, Quantum, Edge, and Mobile computing may also assist Digital Earth
computing. However, picking the best computing mode and transitioning between
different computing modes to best leverage each of them for speciﬁc Digital Earth
tasks is also still quite a challenge (Yang et al. 2013).
26.2.2
Large-Scale Digital Earth Platform Implementation
and Construction
A major challenge for Digital Earth over the coming years will be to develop a new
generation of Digital Earth science platforms in order to provide a new impetus for
interdisciplinary, cross-scale, macro-scientiﬁc discoveries in the era of Big Data and
to make planet Earth more sustainable. As Digital Earth platforms use geospatial
information infrastructures, the speed of technological progress is one of the main
challenges facing the further development of Digital Earth.
It is generally recognised that DE can ﬂourish only if supported by a robust com-
puting infrastructure and good-quality data. As to data, we argue in favour of learning
from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interac-
tivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. By adopting this paradigm
(known as Dataﬁcation), we can develop ecosystems of public administration, ﬁrms,
and civil society, enriching the data to make it ﬁt for AI applications responding to
DE needs (Craglia et al. 2018).
The Australian 2026 Spatial Industry Transformation and Growth Agenda ﬁnds
that the age of “viewing everything through an application lens is coming to an
end”. Instead, platform architectures will be selected primarily to cope with soaring
26
Digital Earth Challenges and Future Trends
815
volumes of data and the complexity of data management, not for their ability to
support applications. In the report, the authors show how the Digital Earth approach
uses a variety of Earth observation data, from the global to the local scale. By using
quantitative spatial analysis methods, Digital Earth allows a deeper understanding of
global-change mechanisms, allowing us to evaluate global change from the perspec-
tives of regional responses and zonal characteristics caused by the Earth’s rotation.
Furthermore, the Digital Earth approach enables us to display and demonstrate the
global-change mechanisms and their temporal effects, in order to better inform deci-
sion makers of potential regional and global schemes for environmental protection.
26.2.3
Strengthening Fundamental Research for Digital
Earth
Asanevolvingdiscipline,DigitalEarthneedsthefollowingquestionstobeanswered:
What is the basic theory of Digital Earth? What are its core characteristics? What
is the difference between Digital Earth and geospatial technology? And what is the
relationship between Digital Earth and Big Earth Data? (Guo 2018).
With the development of Digital Earth, it is necessary to gain a profound under-
standing and make an in-depth analysis of the expanding scope of the concept of
Digital Earth, as well as the impacts of Digital Earth on the interdisciplinary sci-
ences and social progress.
We should pay attention to cross-disciplinarily research in the ﬁelds of Earth
science, information science, space science and related technologies to broaden the
research directions of Digital Earth, and so further help Earth system research reach
new heights.
We should realize that Digital Earth is becoming ever more relevant as the
world undergoes a profound digital revolution. The increasing volume of data being
amassedbyEarthsystemscienceandgeo-informationscienceispromptingexpertsto
investigate and experiment with highly automated and intelligent systems in order to
extract information from enormous datasets, thus driving future innovative research
that will greatly beneﬁt from developments in Digital Earth technologies and systems
(Guo 2017).
It should be realized that Digital Earth can help to bridge the information gap for
the general public by integrating data and information from multiple sources includ-
ing those from space, social networks, and economic data. By developing intelligent
models and data-intensive computing algorithms, Digital Earth can generate useful
information and scientiﬁc knowledge to support the functioning of social services.
As we enter this new age, Digital Earth has been endowed with the new mission
of integrating natural and social sciences so that it can respond to the challenges of
global sustainability, environmental change and digital economic society that human
beings are facing. Digital Earth is being pushed towards contributing to the discovery
816
J. van Genderen et al.
of new knowledge that can support our understanding of the planet and enable us to
live on it in a sustainable manner (Guo et al. 2014).
26.2.4
Developing an Ecosystem for Digital Earth
For the development of Digital Earth systems, an ecosystem should include scientists,
engineers for implementation, and users, as well as applications that make use of the
Digital Earth system services. Furthermore, new aspects such as privacy, security,
education, and training, which have often been ignored in the past, should be put on
the “to-do-list”.
Many Digital Earth datasets, such as volunteered geographic information (Good-
child 2007), raise issues of privacy, security of business, intellectual merit, or intel-
ligence. It is a big challenge to provide proper access to such data and to protect
such information from misuse by unauthorized users. The adoption of a dataﬁcation
approach (i.e., shifting the focus from data sharing to intelligence generation in a
collaborative way) promises to address these challenges.
All the challenges relating to the future of Digital Earth, as described above, plus
the many new opportunities and trends described below, will demand a large increase
in the number of scientists, academics, and business professionals to be trained and
educated in the Digital Earth concept in all its many facets; none more so than in
the ﬁeld of citizen science, as explained and shown in the education chapter of the
Manual. Young people are the key to developing solutions to meet such challenges.
Especially challenging for ISDE will be the need to attract younger researchers and
post-graduate students to become involved in deﬁning how Digital Earth moves
forward.
26.2.5
Addressing Social Complexities
The increasing complexity of the Digital Earth system, and the engagement of an
ever-increasing number of people in building and using the system, will require a
sophisticated approach for leveraging advances in the relevant social and natural sci-
ences,tofacilitateasustainablerateofprogress(seeChap.12SocialMediaandSocial
Awareness). The challenges include cross-cultural and cross-jurisdiction boundaries,
disparate languages, interdisciplinary gaps, and potential misunderstanding (Lane
et al. 2009). The engagement of social media and citizen science in providing more
real-time and social data also pose privacy and related concerns (see Chap. 18 on
Citizen Science in Support of Digital Earth). Engendering trust in the quality of
data and information is a signiﬁcant challenge when massive numbers of users are
contributing data and the information extraction process passes through many steps
that include human intervention. Developing proper models for the measurement of
accuracy or quality is a key to ensure trust (Goodchild and Li 2012).
26
Digital Earth Challenges and Future Trends
817
The advance of Digital Earth will expose many of the privacy concerns associ-
ated with Big Data, such as ﬁne-resolution imagery and data on personal activities
at ﬁne spatiotemporal resolution. How to properly avoid the exposure of personal
information to unauthorized users needs both research and policy attention. Ethical
issues may also be brought up when such information is viewable across cultural and
jurisdiction boundaries or across religious groups (Gross and Acquisti 2005). How
to develop methods to measure privacy exposure and to protect privacy is a challenge
presented in Chap. 25.
In addition to the social concerns raised by Digital Earth, other social challenges
(such as counter-terrorism and presidential election analyses; Braha and de Aguiar
2017) can be addressed by developing new methodologies (such as social network
analyses and social simulations) using a Digital Earth platform or systems. Such
advances would also beneﬁt initiatives of signiﬁcant social complexity, such as the
implementation of the United Nations’ 17 sustainability goals.
26.2.6
Diversiﬁed Curricula Toward Digital Earth Education
With Digital Earth being embraced in our society, there has been a classic continuum
of education (from K−12 to higher education) moving toward training/professional
development such as internships, certiﬁcates and professional certiﬁcations (see
Chap. 24 Digital Earth Education). Because of the difﬁculties related to data acces-
sibility, interdisciplinary connections, and the natural as well as the social context of
Digital Earth, it is challenging to build an overarching framework for the transfor-
mation.
There is a need in K−12 education to improve pre-service teaching training pro-
grams by including more geography and DE technologies in classrooms to better
reﬂect this rapidly evolving geospatial world. Curriculum development is driven by
up-to-date learning objectives and the encouragement of greater DE applications.
In higher education, various curriculum development efforts such as experiential
learning courses and certiﬁcates have been introduced. To promote professional
development, the interaction and partnership between higher education, non-proﬁt
organizations and the geospatial industry are closer than ever. However, there remain
discrepancies between academic education and the career readiness of the next gener-
ation. Misrepresentation of competencies and credentials in the curricula may make
our students “well educated but poorly trained” or “well trained but poorly edu-
cated” (Burrus 2016). (A) diversiﬁed standard(s) is/are thus required to evaluate and
guide future curriculum development, and to bridge the gaps between academia and
industry, education and training, knowledge and skills, etc.
Reﬂecting the interdisciplinary nature of Digital Earth, we call for society-wide
efforts within the ISDE to establish its unique body of knowledge (BoK). A hierar-
chical BoK structure may cover a wide range of knowledge from general geospatial
education to skill-driven competencies. This BoK will provide fundamental guidance
to future DE education.

New Opportunities and Future Trends in Digital Earth
26.3.1
New Technologies
(1) IoT
IoT has been developing rapidly in recent years, with billions of connected
devices being developed and deployed in different domains and regions (such
as urban trafﬁc, ecosystem monitoring, and driverless cars). These devices not
onlysenseessentialelementsofourEarthenvironment,butalsoprovideprocess-
ing capabilities at the edge of the networked environment, pushing innovative
paradigms for distributed computing, such as edge and fog computing. As IoT
matures it will be possible to link EO data with 3D data and with airborne,
UAV, and both surface and underground data, just as Al Gore envisaged twenty
years ago. IoT is becoming a global infrastructure, enabling advanced services
through the interconnection of things that belong to both the physical and virtual
worlds. IoT will signiﬁcantly contribute to implementing a sort of “digital ner-
vous system of the globe, actively informing on events happening on (or close
to) the Earth’s surface by connecting to sensor networks and situation-aware
systems” (Craglia et al. 2012).
(2) Blockchain
Blockchain was developed to support the bitcoin currency, and has the char-
acteristics of decentralization, persistence, anonymity, and auditability. These
characteristics provide a potential solution to the data security and privacy prob-
lems in Earth data, and different aspects of these are being investigated to sup-
port Digital Earth. However blockchain relies on very intensive computing, and
absorbs vast amounts of electrical energy. As such it is clearly not sustainable
or scalable. The example of blockchain raises a fundamental question for Dig-
ital Earth: while it is a powerful way of addressing the sustainability problems
facing humanity, it nevertheless requires growing investment in technology and
growing power consumption, creating its own sustainability problem.
(3) Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality
The demand for all types of interactive experiences, whether from scientists,
business people, government decision makers, or ordinary citizens, will con-
tinue to grow (notwithstanding the issues raised in the previous paragraph). The
foundation of VR/AR/MR lies in geospatial technology. For example, geospa-
tial technology is contributing to the market for wearable technology, which
enables users to track their steps, heart rate, etc., and thus helps them to have a
better understanding of their activities during the day.
26
Digital Earth Challenges and Future Trends
819
(4) Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), a broad term that includes deep learning, knowledge
graphs, and brain-inspired computing, is one of the most prominent technolo-
gies currently being advanced. It is a hot topic for researchers and offers great
opportunities for Digital Earth knowledge discovery, but is also raising a num-
ber of important concerns even among the world’s greatest technological minds
(Craglia et al. 2018). While generalizability across space and time has always
been a requirement of basic science, AI requires a somewhat looser interpreta-
tion of the term, and its popularity may even have a fundamental effect on the
conduct of science and its epistemological underpinnings. The strength of AI
may lie in prediction, whereas science has long emphasized explanation and
understanding. It is also far from clear what role the principles of geographic
information science—spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, etc.—can play
in an AI that is virtually theory-free.
The development of AI is strongly linked to an exponential increase in the avail-
ability and quality of data on which AI applications are built. The development
of new connectivity via 5G, new computing infrastructure, and sensor networks
in the Internet of Things offers major opportunities to create ecosystems of
shared data across the public sector, commercial sector, and civil society so that
AI applications address the most pressing needs of our planet and society, at
both local and global levels (Craglia et al. 2018).
(5) Hyper-Connectivity
The volume of available data is now growing at an unprecedented pace. World-
wide, citizens, public administration, and private companies generate and store
a vast volume of data daily. A driving factor behind this is certainly increasing
Internet connectivity. In the past, the Internet evolved from a network of online
resources—today, there exist more than 1 billion websites (Netcraft 2019) tar-
geted by over 6 billion Google queries per day (Internet Live Stats 2019)—to a
global social network, connecting people and communities worldwide. In 2018
there were more than 2.3 billion Facebook (Facebook 2019) and 321 million
Twitter (Twitter 2019) active users monthly; every day, around 4 billion videos
are viewed on Youtube (MerchDope 2019), and 95 million photos and videos
are shared on Instagram (Instagram 2019). According to some global market
experts, in 2025 each connected person will have at least one data interaction
every 18 s (IDC and Seagate 2018). For example, digital payments are expected
to hit 762 billion by 2020 (Capgemini and BNP Paribas 2018), while Inter-
net devices carried by individuals (e.g., smartphones or wearable technology)
will continuously record and upload to the Internet data on humans’ behaviour
(digital “footprints”), such as location, physical activity, and health status.
820
J. van Genderen et al.
(6) 5G, Fog/Edge Computing
Many connected devices (including those using AI) require the transmission of
huge amounts of data to the cloud for storage and processing. The advent of the
5G (the ﬁfth generation of mobile wireless technologies) network will dramat-
ically increase this demand in the next few years—and, in particular, demand
for real-time processing services. Critical applications using IoT devices (for
example in sectors like health, energy, or automobiles) will depend on the reli-
ability of communication networks. In addition to time latency, this raises other
important challenges, such as security, privacy, and energy efﬁciency for data
moving and processing. For these reasons, novel data computing architectures
have been introduced—in particular, fog and edge computing. The advent of
5G will be disrupting for mobile connectivity, because not only will it deliver
faster broadband to consumers, it will also enable emerging technologies such
as autonomous vehicles and the IoT to become a reality for both industries and
consumers. Meanwhile, we should consider the environmental impact of 5G on
energy consumption and human exposure.
(7) Progress in Computing and Microelectronics
Big Data analytics and AI require new types of computing to address emerg-
ing needs—for example, to support parallel and tensor processing, overcome
the traditional computer architecture latency problem, embed machine learning,
deploy processor-in-memory, 4D virtual reality and augmented reality, to visu-
alize and, notably, to consume less energy. Traditional CPUs have been replaced
by innovative (and green) processing technologies, often developed by big ICT
companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel, Tesla) that are better suited
to AI. These technologies include GPU, TPU, cloud chips, neuromorphic com-
puting, reversible computing, and quantum computing. Recent developments
also include ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-speciﬁc
integrated circuits (ASICs) as the next primary chips for AI/ML. The main idea
behind FPGAs is that they are reconﬁgurable: the chip hardware wiring can be
changed as easily as writing code.
(8) In-memory Computing
In-memory computing stores data in RAM rather than in databases hosted on
disks. This eliminates the I/O latency and the need to implement database trans-
actions reliability and consistently. This technology speeds data access exponen-
tiallybecauseRAM-storeddataisavailableinstantaneously,whiledatastoredon
disks is limited by network and disk speeds. In-memory computing requires that
massive amounts of data be cached, enabling extremely fast response times, and
that session data be stored to help achieve optimum performance; for instance,
see HP in-memory solutions. This approach allows quick analysis of massive
volumes of data in real time at very high speeds, and also supports the detection
of patterns.
26
Digital Earth Challenges and Future Trends
821
26.3.2
New Services
There are many new trends involving the development of innovative products by
government departments, space agencies, and private companies. These offer funda-
mentally new services based on machine learning, and also integration with related
services and technologies, such as navigation, geolocation, artiﬁcial intelligence,
IoT, Big Earth Data, blockchain, and many others.
It is clear that the new, disruptive technology trends will transform many strate-
gies across the globe. At the intersection of technology, government, science, and
industry, clashes and resistance to change may impede progress in ﬁnding solutions
to many of the world’s most vexing problems. On the other hand, it is clear that new
technologies can sometimes create more problems than they solve when not all of
their consequences are anticipated.
26.3.3
New Applications
With advances in Earth system science, the need for sustainable development has
been well understood in the scientiﬁc community, in government, and in human
society. Digital Earth will serve as an enabling platform and system for Earth system
science as well as research into global climate change.
With regard to the challenges facing the use of Digital Earth in studying climate
and environmental changes, we have seen in earlier chapters of the manual (e.g.,
Chap. 14) that, due to cloud cover, aerosols in the atmosphere, seasonal snow cover,
sensor failure, and limited observation geometry, existing remote sensing products
suffer from noise, and time and space discontinuity. These defects severely constrain
the study of land-surface processes and climate change simulations that are driven by
spatial data parameters, and therefore reduce the reliability of climate-change projec-
tions. It is necessary to synthesize multi-sensor remote sensing data to obtain high-
quality and spatiotemporally continuous data on land-surface parameters. This will
allow more accurate evaluation of the spatiotemporal variation of climate-sensitive
parameters, improve the accuracy of climate models, and also allow the accurate
monitoring of the locations of disturbances, the extent of their impact, and the con-
sequent future changes (e.g., Shupeng and van Genderen 2008). This challenge also
applies to the utilization of Digital Earth to support most advances in geoscience
(Yang and Huang 2013).
Digital Earth should evolve in a sustainable way by considering the vision, tech-
nology, workforce, policy, and many other aspects; for example, how to apply, adapt,
and integrate the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the next Dig-
ital Earth system (Anderson et al. 2017; Scott and Rajabifard 2017). Among the 17
goals, at least 8 could be realized by beneﬁting in different ways from Digital Earth
Data. These goals include clean water, affordable energy, sustainable cities, climate
change, life below water, life on land, good health, and peace. Digital Earth can play
a very important role in these ﬁelds (Guo 2017).
822
J. van Genderen et al.
26.3.4
New Paradigms
The Web has seen many developments, connecting more and more elements of our
society, and, all the time, creating new business intelligence. Today, the Web enables
the externalization of practically any digital capability and service, moving most
of society’s transactions and processes onto the network by exploiting the platform
economy, hyper-connectivity, and Cloud computing. IoT and 5G are promising to
further expand the Web by connecting vast numbers of devices and generating new
business intelligence. In the future, simple objects (e.g., devices), complex real-
time systems (e.g., moving vehicles), and sophisticated analytical and forecasting
models will all be online and exchanging information. Real-world objects (sensing
and acting upon the physical world) will be represented in the virtual world, and
their interconnection will enable advanced services. Enabling technologies include
mobile technology (5G), cloud computing (virtual computing), big data, and AI (deep
analytics).
This will lead to an ecosystem of diverse (Internet-based) platforms and domain
applications, which is termed the Web of Things (WoT) by W3C. WoT aims to
connect real-world objects and systems to the Web, creating a decentralized IoT
wherethingsarelinkable,discoverable,andusable(W3C2019).Insuchaframework,
a promising interaction pattern is called a digital twin: a digital model of a real
connected object or a set of objects representing a complex domain environment.
Depending on its complexity, a digital representation (i.e., the twin) may reside in
a cloud or on an edge system. A digital twin can be used to represent real-world
things and systems that may not be continuously online, or to run simulations of new
applications and services before they are deployed to the real world.
In the future, it might be possible to connect (in the virtual world) diverse digital
twins representing extremely complex and vast domains, such as natural phenomena
and social processes. Virtual forms of future digital twins might even be developed
to model the Earth domain, a digital twin of our planet, or Earth twin. This paradigm
would support the ISDE’s vision of Digital Earth as “multiple connected infrastruc-
tures based on open access and participation across multiple technological platforms
addressing the needs of different audiences”.
26.3.5
New Challenges
(1) Sustainability challenges
The digital transformation of our society is facing an increasing problem: the
severe mismatch between the processing and storage needs of the escalating
volumes of data available, and the need to have a sustainable energy footprint. A
report prepared for Greenpeace (2012) claimed that if the cloud were a country,
it would have the ﬁfth largest energy demand in the world, while Vidal (2017)
suggested that the data tsunami could consume one ﬁfth of global electricity
by 2025. Trust (including cyber-security) and ICT energy consumption will be
26
Digital Earth Challenges and Future Trends
823
two important determinants of the long-term sustainability of the next digital
(r)evolution. The constant innovation in digital technologies promises to address
sustainability issues; however, side and rebound effects must also be considered.
For instance, while blockchain promises to address some important security and
trust issues, ledger-based networks (like blockchain technology) still remain to
be investigated, in particular, in terms of their energy consumption (Nascimento
et al. 2018). Another valuable example is represented by the development of
green(i.e.,lessenergy-consuming)devices,which,astheybecomecheaper,will
likely have the effect of increasing the number of devices being commercialized
and the amount of time for which they are used. Finally, concerns have already
been raised about the environmental impact of 5G technology, especially in
relation to energy consumption and human health issues (Van Chien et al. 2016):
unlike 4G networks, 5G uses extremely high frequencies that do not travel as far
as 4G waves, and, therefore, requires much smaller cells and a higher density
of transmitters.
(2) Ethical and security challenges
It is important to think about how the digital transformation of our society
(and in particular the adoption of AI) might bring new challenges in relation
to individual human beings. In this context, it is crucial to consider how the
concepts of autonomy and the identity of individuals as well as security, safety,
and privacy issues might change. AI systems are currently limited to narrow
and well-deﬁned tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their
human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. Ethical
and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to building trust in this disruptive
technology, but we also need the broader engagement of civil society in the val-
ues to be embedded in digital transformation and future developments (Craglia
et al. 2018).
(3) New governance challenges
The development of DE and the digital transformation of our society provide
many new opportunities for a deeper understanding of both physical and social
phenomena, and new tools for collective action. As we see in the environmen-
tal domain, however, it takes a long time and a consistent effort to forge a
shared view of both problems and solutions, and to reach agreements which,
even then, are not without setbacks and challenges. Digital transformation adds
a new dimension to the governance challenge because it reshufﬂes the power
relationships between governments, the commercial sector, and civil society.
Increasingly, the control of data conveys power. Whilst many governments
have begun to realize that their ability to understand and govern society is
diminishing, the IoT and AI revolution may bring new actors into the game:
machine-to-machine data generation, elaboration, and autonomous action may
give machines an agency as yet unforeseen, challenging further the ability to
824
J. van Genderen et al.
govern the system. This, therefore, requires a collective response by the interna-
tional community, including the setting of new ground rules to ensure continued
human control of the direction of travel and how to get there.
26.4
Conclusions
When the concept of Digital Earth was ﬁrst mooted, it had several drivers, including
scientiﬁc questions, technological developments, critical thinking about the domain,
and our capabilities for content handling. The challenges of the concept have driven
us to adopt new technologies and approaches, and to develop new solutions. All these
new Digital Earth technologies and the multitude of new Earth observation data from
satellites offer new possibilities for DE scholars to advance our understanding of
how the ocean, atmosphere, land, and cryosphere operate and interact as part of an
integrated Digital Earth system. They also bring both challenges and opportunities
to career preparedness for the next generation, especially to curriculum development
for education at all levels.
Since the vision put forward by Al Gore, which he illustrated by imagining a young
girl experiencing the Earth through the medium of virtual reality, many advances have
been made at various levels and in various aspects, but we are still some distance from
the ultimate Digital Earth as envisioned by Gore. While technology has advanced in
leaps and bounds, and an approximation to Digital Earth is now available to anyone
through readily available devices, a host of new challenges present themselves. Tech-
nology which was once seen as a utopian solution to many human problems is now
recognized as having the potential to create almost as many problems as it solves.
Future research will need to focus not only on the technology and on the science
that it makes possible, but also on its societal context: on its sustainability, on equity
of access, and on the dystopias it can create alongside the utopias. Meanwhile we
can expect that a steady stream of new technologies will sustain interest and ensure
steady progress toward the dream of a Digital Earth.

The Digital Earth: Understanding Our Planet
in the 21st Century
TheSpeechDeliveredbytheFormerUSVicePresident,AlGoreattheCalifornia
Science Center, Los Angeles, California, on January 31, 1998.
A new wave of technological innovation is allowing us to capture, store, process
and display an unprecedented amount of information about our planet and a wide
variety of environmental and cultural phenomena. Much of this information will be
“georeferenced”—that is, it will refer to some speciﬁc place on the Earth’s surface.
The hard part of taking advantage of this ﬂood of geospatial information will
be making sense of it.—turning raw data into understandable information. Today,
we often ﬁnd that we have more information than we know what to do with. The
Landsat program, designed to help us understand the global environment, is a good
example. The Landsat satellite is capable of taking a complete photograph of the
entire planet every two weeks, and it’s been collecting data for more than 20 years.
In spite of the great need for that information, the vast majority of those images
have never ﬁred a single neuron in a single human brain. Instead, they are stored in
electronic silos of data. We used to have an agricultural policy where we stored grain
in Midwestern silos and let it rot while millions of people starved to death. Now we
have an insatiable hunger for knowledge. Yet a great deal of data remains unused.
Part of the problem has to do with the way information is displayed. Someone
once said that if we tried to describe the human brain in computer terms, it looks
as if we have a low bit rate, but very high resolution. For example, researchers have
long known that we have trouble remembering more than seven pieces of data in our
short-term memory. That’s a low bit rate. On the other hand, we can absorb billions
of bits of information instantly if they are arrayed in a recognizable pattern within
which each bit gains meaning in relation to all the others—a human face, or a galaxy
of stars.
The tools we have most commonly used to interact with data, such as the “desktop
metaphor” employed by the Macintosh and Windows operating systems, are not
really suited to this new challenge. I believe we need a “Digital Earth”. A multi-
resolution, three-dimensional representation of the planet, into which we can embed
vast quantities of geo-referenced data.

Imagine, for example, a young child going to a Digital Earth exhibit at a local
museum. After donning a head-mounted display, she sees Earth as it appears from
space. Using a data glove, she zooms in, using higher and higher levels of resolution,
to see continents, then regions, countries, cities, and ﬁnally individual houses, trees,
and other natural and man-made objects. Having found an area of the planet she is
interested in exploring, she takes the equivalent of a “magic carpet ride” through a
3-D visualization of the terrain. Of course, terrain is only one of the many kinds of
data with which she can interact. Using the systems’ voice recognition capabilities,
she is able to request information on land cover, distribution of plant and animal
species, real-time weather, roads, political boundaries, and population. She can also
visualize the environmental information that she and other students all over the world
have collected as part of the GLOBE project. This information can be seamlessly
fused with the digital map or terrain data. She can get more information on many
of the objects she sees by using her data glove to click on a hyperlink. To prepare
for her family’s vacation to Yellowstone National Park, for example, she plans the
perfect hike to the geysers, bison, and bighorn sheep that she has just read about. In
fact, she can follow the trail visually from start to ﬁnish before she ever leaves the
museum in her hometown.
She is not limited to moving through space, but can also travel through time. After
taking a virtual ﬁeld-trip to Paris to visit the Louvre, she moves backward in time
to learn about French history, perusing digitized maps overlaid on the surface of the
Digital Earth, newsreel footage, oral history, newspapers and other primary sources.
She sends some of this information to her personal e-mail address to study later. The
time-line, which stretches off in the distance, can be set for days, years, centuries,
or even geological epochs, for those occasions when she wants to learn more about
dinosaurs.
Obviously, no one organization in government, industry or academia could under-
take such a project. Like the World Wide Web, it would require the grassroots efforts
of hundreds of thousands of individuals, companies, university researchers, and gov-
ernment organizations. Although some of the data for the Digital Earth would be
in the public domain, it might also become a digital marketplace for companies
selling a vast array of commercial imagery and value-added information services.
It could also become a “collaboratory”—a laboratory without walls—for research
scientists seeking to understand the complex interaction between humanity and our
environment.
Technologies Needed for a Digital Earth
Although this scenario may seem like science ﬁction, most of the technologies and
capabilities that would be required to build a Digital Earth are either here or under
development. Of course, the capabilities of a Digital Earth will continue to evolve
over time. What we will be able to do in 2005 will look primitive compared to the
Appendix E: The Digital Earth: Understanding Our Planet in the 21st Century
845
Digital Earth of the year 2020. Below are just a few of the technologies that are
needed:
Computational science: Until the advent of computers, both experimental and
theoretical ways of creating knowledge have been limited. Many of the phenomena
that experimental scientists would like to study are too hard to observe—they may
be too small or too large, too fast or too slow, occurring in a billionth of a second or
over a billion years. Pure theory, on the other hand, cannot predict the outcomes of
complex natural phenomena like thunderstorms or air ﬂows over airplanes. But with
high-speed computers as a new tool, we can simulate phenomena that are impossible
to observe, and simultaneously better understand data from observations. In this way,
computational science allows us to overcome the limitations of both experimental
and theoretical science. Modeling and simulation will give us new insights into the
data that we are collecting about our planet.
Mass storage: The Digital Earth will require storing quadrillions of bytes of
information. Later this year, NASAs Mission to Planet Earth program will generate
a terrabyte of information each day. Fortunately, we are continuing to make dramatic
improvements in this area.
Satellite imagery: The Administration has licensed commercial satellites sys-
tems that will provide 1-meter resolution imagery beginning in early 1998. This
provides a level of accuracy sufﬁcient for detailed maps, and that was previously
only available using aerial photography. This technology, originally developed in the
U.S. intelligence community, is incredibly accurate. As one company put it, “It’s like
having a camera capable of looking from London to Paris and knowing where each
object in the picture is to within the width of a car headlight.”
Broadband networks: The data needed for a digital globe will be maintained by
thousands of different organizations, not in one monolithic database. That means that
the servers that are participating in the Digital Earth will need to be connected by
high-speed networks. Driven by the explosive growth of Internet trafﬁc, telecommu-
nications carriers are already experimenting with 10 gigabit/second networks, and
terrabit networking technology is one of the technical goals of the Next Generation
Internet initiative. The bad news is that it will take a while before most of us have
this kind of bandwidth to our home, which is why it will be necessary to have Digital
Earth access points in public places like children’s museums and science museums.
Interoperability: The Internet and the World Wide Web have succeeded because
of the emergence of a few, simple, widely agreed upon protocols, such as the Internet
protocol. The Digital Earth will also need some level of interoperability, so that
geographical information generated by one kind of application software can be read
by another. The GIS industry is seeking to address many of these issues through the
Open GIS Consortium.
Metadata: Metadata is “data about data.” For imagery or other georeferenced
information to be helpful, it might be necessary to know its name, location, author or
source, date, data format, resolution, etc. The Federal Geographic Data Committee is
working with industry and state and local government to develop voluntary standards
for metadata.
846
Appendix E: The Digital Earth: Understanding Our Planet in the 21st Century
Of course, further technological progress is needed to realize the full potential
of the Digital Earth, especially in areas such as automatic interpretation of imagery,
the fusion of data from multiple sources, and intelligent agents that could ﬁnd and
link information on the Web about a particular spot on the planet. But enough of the
pieces are in place right now to warrant proceeding with this exciting initiative.
Potential Applications
The applications that will be possible with broad, easy to use access to global geospa-
tial information will be limited only by our imagination. We can get a sense of the
possibilities by looking at today’s applications of GIS and sensor data, some of which
have been driven by industry, others by leading-edge public sector users:
Conducting virtual diplomacy: To support the Bosnia peace negotiations, the
Pentagon developed a virtual-reality landscape that allowed the negotiators to take
a simulated aerial tour of the proposed borders. At one point in the negotiations,
the Serbian President agreed to a wider corridor between Sarajevo and the Muslim
enclave of Gorazde, after he saw that mountains made a narrow corridor impractical.
Fighting crime: The City of Salinas, California has reduced youth handgun vio-
lence by using GIS to detect crime patterns and gang activity. By collecting infor-
mation on the distribution and frequency of criminal activities, the city has been able
to quickly redeploy police resources.
Preserving biodiversity: Planning agencies in the Camp Pendelton, California
region predict that population will grow from 1.1 million in 1990 to 1.6 million in
2010. This region contains over 200 plants and animals that are listed by federal or
stateagenciesasendangered,threatened,orrare.Bycollectinginformationonterrain,
soil type, annual rainfall, vegetation, land use, and ownership, scientists modeled the
impact on biodiversity of different regional growth plans.
Predicting climate change: One of the signiﬁcant unknowns in modeling climate
change is the global rate of deforestation. By analyzing satellite imagery, researchers
at the University of New Hampshire, working with colleagues in Brazil, are able to
monitor changes in land cover and thus determine the rate and location of deforesta-
tion in the Amazon. This technique is now being extended to other forested areas in
the world.
Increasingagriculturalproductivity:Farmersarealreadybeginningtousesatel-
lite imagery and Global Positioning Systems for early detection of diseases and pests,
and to target the application of pesticides, fertilizer and water to those parts of their
ﬁelds that need it the most. This is known as precision farming, or “farming by the
inch.”

The Way Forward
We have an unparalleled opportunity to turn a ﬂood of raw data into understand-
able information about our society and out planet. This data will include not only
high-resolution satellite imagery of the planet, digital maps, and economic, social,
and demographic information. If we are successful, it will have broad societal and
commercial beneﬁts in areas such as education, decision-making for a sustainable
future, land-use planning, agricultural, and crisis management.
The Digital Earth project could allow us to respond to manmade or natural
disasters—or to collaborate on the long-term environmental challenges we face.
A Digital Earth could provide a mechanism for users to navigate and search for
geospatial information—and for producers to publish it. The Digital Earth would be
composed of both the “user interface”—a browsable, 3D version of the planet avail-
able at various levels of resolution, a rapidly growing universe of networked geospa-
tial information, and the mechanisms for integrating and displaying information from
multiple sources.
A comparison with the World Wide Web is constructive. [In fact, it might build
on several key Web and Internet standards.] Like the Web, the Digital Earth would
organically evolve over time, as technology improves and the information available
expands. Rather than being maintained by a single organization, it would be com-
posed of both publically available information and commercial products and services
from thousands of different organizations. Just as interoperability was the key for the
Web, the ability to discover and display data contained in different formats would be
essential.
I believe that the way to spark the development of a Digital Earth is to sponsor
a testbed, with participation from government, industry, and academia. This testbed
would focus on a few applications, such as education and the environment, as well
as the tough technical issues associated with interoperability, and policy issues such
as privacy. As prototypes became available, it would also be possible to interact with
the Digital Earth in multiple places around the country with access to high-speed
networks, and get a more limited level of access over the Internet.
Clearly, the Digital Earth will not happen overnight.
In the ﬁrst stage, we should focus on integrating the data from multiple sources
that we already have. We should also connect our leading children’s museums and
science museums to high-speed networks such as the Next Generation Internet so
that children can explore our planet. University researchers would be encouraged to
partner with local schools and museums to enrich the Digital Earth project—possibly
by concentrating on local geospatial information.
Next, we should endeavor to develop a digital map of the world at 1 meter
resolution.
In the long run, we should seek to put the full range of data about our planet and
our history at our ﬁngertips.
In the months ahead, I intend to challenge experts in government, industry,
academia, and non-proﬁt organizations to help develop a strategy for realizing this
848
Appendix E: The Digital Earth: Understanding Our Planet in the 21st Century
vision. Working together, we can help solve many of the most pressing problems
facing our society, inspiring our children to learn more about the world around them,
and accelerate the growth of a multi-billion dollar industry.
