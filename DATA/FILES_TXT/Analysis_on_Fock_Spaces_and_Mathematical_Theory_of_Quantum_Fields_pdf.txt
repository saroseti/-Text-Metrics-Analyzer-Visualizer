Preface to the Second Edition
In this new edition, the author has made mainly the following revisions
to the ﬁrst edition, in addition to some minor changes and corrections of
minor errors:
(1) A relatively great expansion of Chapter 1 with some rewriting.
(2) A little expansion of Chapters 5, 6 and 8.
(3) Two subjects, which were missing in the ﬁrst edition, are added: occu-
pation number representations (Sections 2.10, 5.8 and 6.10) and Haag’s
theorem (Section 8.14). The latter is important in understanding the
mathematical structure of quantum ﬁeld theory.
(4) In view of the importance of the concept of spontaneous symmetry
breaking in modern quantum physics, a new chapter, Chapter 15, is
added as an introduction to this subject.
(4) The bibliography in the ﬁrst edition is also revised but not intended to
be complete.
The author thanks readers for their comments and remarks on the ﬁrst
edition.

Preface to the First Edition
The notion of a quantum ﬁeld was introduced in physics in the later part of
the 1920s to unify the particle and wave pictures of quantum particles, such
as electrons and photons, which have the so-called wave–particle duality.
After pioneering work on quantization of wave functions (the so-called “sec-
ond quantization”) by Dirac (1927), Jordan & Klein (1927), Jordan (1927)
and Jordan & Wigner (1928), Heisenberg and Pauli (1929, 1930)1 presented
a general theory of quantum ﬁelds which uniﬁes the foregoing theories,
where a quantum ﬁeld is “deﬁned” by the “canonical quantization” of a
classical wave ﬁeld.
A basic class of quantum ﬁelds is called free quantum ﬁelds, which
describe free (non-interacting) elementary particles. As far as free quantum
ﬁelds are concerned, the quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) by Heisenberg and
Pauli was successful in unifying the wave and particle pictures of elemen-
tary particles with a general theoretical framework for quantum systems,
in which the number of elementary particles may change. However, if one
applies the formalism of QFT to an interacting system of quantum ﬁelds
and calculates the physical quantities of interest in an approximate way
(formal perturbation theory), then one encounters divergent integrals and
hence meaningless results. This is the so-called “diﬃculty of divergence”
in QFT.2
Later, in the 1940s, a prescription to avoid the diﬃculty of divergence
and to obtain meaningful results which can be compared with experiments
1Heisenberg, W. and Pauli, W. Zur Quantendynamik der Wellenfelder I. Z. Phys. 56:
1–61; ibid. II, Z. Phys. 59: 168–190.
2There are two kinds of divergences: ultraviolet and infrared. The former (resp., latter)
is a divergence with respect to large momenta (resp., small momenta in the case of
massless quantum particles).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
was invented by Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga. The prescription
is called “renormalization theory,” with which QFT as a physical theory
revived. In particular, quantum electrodynamics (QED), a QFT describ-
ing the interaction of electrons (the quantum electron ﬁeld) and photons
(the quantum radiation ﬁeld), explains experimental results with surpris-
ingly high precision.3 From a mathematically rigorous point of view, how-
ever, the diﬃculty of divergence in QFT remains unsolved; it was unclear
what kind of mathematics can justify QFT with renormalization theory.4
In these situations, mathematically rigorous investigations of QFT were
started in the 1950s to give it a sound mathematical basis. Since then,
mathematical studies on quantum ﬁelds have formed a major stream of
research in modern mathematical physics. Many interesting mathematical
theories have been born from studies on mathematical problems in QFT and
are still developing in various directions, having close relations mutually.
These developments show the richness of mathematics that the concept of
quantum ﬁeld has in itself and suggest that QFT may have something to
do with almost all areas in mathematics, explicitly or implicitly. Quantum
ﬁelds are so fascinating but not so easy to understand in their totality.
The purpose of this book is to describe and explain to beginners the basic
aspects of the mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds.
In mathematical studies on QFT, there are basically two approaches: an
axiomatic one and a constructive one. The former assumes a set of axioms
that a quantum ﬁeld should obey and investigates what results can be
derived from the axioms. This approach is useful in the analysis of general
aspects of QFT which are independent of individual quantum ﬁeld models.
QFT based on this approach is called axiomatic QFT. On the other hand,
the latter approach is concerned with showing the mathematical existence
of concrete models in QFT and deriving their properties in a mathemat-
ically rigorous way. This kind of QFT is called constructive QFT.5 But
this classiﬁcation of QFT is just for convenience; these two approaches are,
3See, for example, Kinoshita, T. (ed.) (1990). Quantum Electrodynamics. Singapore:
World Scientiﬁc. The three physicists mentioned above were awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics in 1965 for their contributions to the construction of QED with the renor-
malization theory (Nobel Lectures, Physics Vol. 4, 1972, Elsevier Publishing Company,
Amsterdam New York).
4At present (as of April 10, 2024), this problem is not solved yet for QFT in four-
dimensional space-time.
5Originally, the name “constructive QFT” was used for mathematical approaches con-
structing concretely relativistic interacting quantum ﬁeld models. However, here, we use
the word in a wider sense.

in fact, complementary. Rather, by employing these two approaches, one
may arrive at a deeper, higher and wider cognition of the nature of the
microscopic world described by quantum ﬁelds.
This book consists of two parts. Part I, which is from Chapter 1 to
Chapter 7, is devoted to giving a detailed description of the theory of Fock
spaces, which are basic spaces in the mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds.
From a purely mathematical point of view, a Fock space is a general and
natural type of Hilbert space in the sense that it is deﬁned as the inﬁnite
direct sum of tensor products of a Hilbert space (see Chapters 4–6 for
details), i.e., in a Fock space, the concept of sum is incorporated with the
concept of product in a general and natural form in terms of a Hilbert
space with the concept of inﬁnity (recall that “sum” and “product” are
fundamental concepts which appear in almost all places in the mathematical
world, taking various forms). Historically, as its name suggests, the ﬁrst
concrete forms of Fock spaces were presented by Fock6 in 1932 in relation
to the aforementioned “second quantization.” In the context of QFT, a Fock
space is used to describe the state vectors of a quantum system in which
inﬁnitely many elementary particles may exist. It is well known that there
are two kinds of families of elementary particles, i.e., bosons and fermions.
Corresponding to this fact, there are three types of Fock spaces. A Fock
space describing the state vectors of a quantum system consisting of the
same kind of bosons (resp., fermions) is called a boson (resp., fermion) Fock
space, and a Fock space describing the state vectors of a quantum system
consisting of the same kinds of bosons and fermions is called a boson–
fermion Fock space.7 In fact, a boson Fock space (resp., a fermion Fock
space) is identiﬁed with a closed subspace of a larger Hilbert space, called
a full Fock space. From this point of view, in this book, a description of the
theory of Fock spaces begins with a full Fock space in Chapter 4. The theory
of boson Fock space (resp., fermion Fock space and boson–fermion Fock
space) is discussed in Chapter 5 (resp., Chapters 6 and 7). In particular,
in Chapter 7, a theory of inﬁnite-dimensional Dirac-type operators on a
boson–fermion Fock space, which is a new theory developed by the author
of this book in connection with supersymmetric QFT, is described in detail.
As far as the author knows, this is the ﬁrst time that the theory has been
presented as part of a book.
6Fock, V. Konﬁgurationsraum und zweite Quantelung. Z. Phys. 75: 622–647.
7There is another type of Fock space, called a q-Fock space, which interpolates a boson
Fock space and a fermion Fock space. But, in this book, we do not discuss it.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In Part II, which is from Chapter 8 to Chapter 14, QFT is described
as an application of the mathematical theories in Part I. Except in
Chapter 8, in which the general theories of QFT including axiomatic QFT
are described, concrete quantum ﬁeld models and their basic properties
are discussed. In Chapters 9–12, we construct four kinds of free quan-
tum ﬁelds: (i) de Broglie ﬁeld: a non-relativistic matter ﬁeld (Chapter 9);
(ii) Klein-Gordon ﬁeld: a relativistic scalar ﬁeld (Chapter 10); (iii) radi-
ation ﬁeld (Chapter 11); and (iv) Dirac ﬁeld: a relativistic spinor ﬁeld
(Chapter‘12). Free quantum ﬁelds do not describe interacting elementary
particles. In Chapter 13, we treat a simple interacting quantum ﬁeld model,
called the van Hove model, or the van Hove–Miyatake (vHM) model. This
model is a prototype for interacting quantum ﬁeld models and has been
extensively studied. In this book, an abstract version of the model is deﬁned
and analyzed in detail. This approach makes clear the general structures
behind the concrete vHM model. It is shown how the problems of ultra-
violet divergence and infrared divergence are solved in the abstract vHM
model. In the last chapter, we present a list of interacting quantum ﬁeld
models, which are more complex and/or realistic than the vHM model, and
give a short description of each model. To make the book as self-contained
as possible, appendices are added.
This book is based on the author’s books Fock Spaces and Quantum
Fields I and II (2000, Nippon-Hyoron-Sha, Tokyo) written in Japanese, but
it is not just an English translation of them: in this English edition, expan-
sions as well as alterations have been made (e.g., Chapter 1 is newly added
and Chapter 0 (heuristic arguments on QFT in physics) in the Japanese
edition is not included). This book is primarily intended to be an introduc-
tory textbook, not a monograph, as are the Japanese editions. Hence, the
bibliography in the book is partial and far from complete. It also includes
textbooks and monographs written in Japanese, some of which are cited
in the Japanese editions. They may be helpful for readers who can read
Japanese. The author thanks the readers of the Japanese editions for their
comments, remarks and questions, which have been useful in writing this
revised and enlarged edition.

Reader’s Guide
Chapter 1 is a preliminary chapter which is devoted to the description of
elements of the theory of linear operators (in particular, unbounded self-
adjoint operators) on Hilbert spaces. Those who are familiar with these
topics can skip Chapter 1 and start reading from Chapter 2. In this book,
Chapter 7 is not necessarily needed to read Chapters 8–14. Therefore, for
the ﬁrst reading, one can skip Chapter 7.

Chapter 1
Theory of Linear Operators
This chapter is devoted to mathematical preliminaries: the fundamentals
of the theory of linear operators on Banach and Hilbert spaces are reviewed within
the scope of the following chapters. We assume that the reader is familiar with
the elements of Banach space theory as well as those of Hilbert space theory.
1.1
Linear Operators on Vector Space
Throughout this book, the symbol K denotes R (the set of real numbers)
or C (the set of complex numbers). An element of K is called a scalar.
1.1.1
Deﬁnitions
Let X and Y be vector spaces over K. Recall that a non-empty subset
D of X is called a subspace of X if, for all Ψ, Φ ∈D and α, β ∈K,
αΨ + βΦ ∈D. A linear operator T from X to Y is a mapping from a
subspace D of X to Y (i.e., T : D →Y ) such that, for all Ψ, Φ ∈D and
α, β ∈K,
T (αΨ + βΦ) = αT (Ψ) + βT (Φ)
(linearity).
The subspace D is called the domain of T and denoted as D = D(T ).
We also write T (Ψ) = T Ψ. If D(T ) = X , then T is said to be every-
where deﬁned. A linear operator from X to Y is also called a linear
transformation from X to Y .
We sometimes simply say “operator” instead of “linear operator.”

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows from the deﬁnition of a linear operator that, for all n ∈N
(the set of natural numbers), Ψj ∈D(T ) and αj ∈K (j = 1, . . . , n),
T
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠=

j=1
αjT Ψj.
We denote the set of linear operators from X to Y by L(X , Y ). In
the case where X = Y , we use the following symbol:
L(X ) := L(X , X ).
As a convention, an element T in L(X ) is said to be a linear operator on
X even if it is not everywhere deﬁned.
We denote by IX the identity operator (or the identity) on X :
IX (Ψ) := Ψ, Ψ ∈X .
Remark 1.1. In the case where X and Y are complex vector spaces, there
is another class of mappings from the subspaces of X to Y which makes a
contrast with L(X , Y ). Let D be a subspace of X . A mapping A : D →Y
is said to be anti-linear if
A(αΨ + βΦ) = α∗A(Ψ) + β∗A(Φ),
Ψ, Φ ∈D, α, β ∈C,
where α∗is the complex conjugate of α. In this case, A is called an anti-
linear operator from X to Y with domain D(A) := D.
For T ∈L(X , Y ), the set
Ran(T ) := {T Ψ | Ψ ∈D(T )}
is called the range of T , or the image of T . It is easy to see that Ran(T )
is a subspace of Y . We sometimes write Ran(T ) = RanT .
The direct sum of the vector spaces X and Y is the vector space
deﬁned by
X ⊕Y := {(Ψ, Φ)|Ψ ∈X , Φ ∈Y }
with addition (Ψ, Φ) + (Ψ ′, Φ′) := (Ψ + Ψ ′, Φ + Φ′) and scalar multiplication
α(Ψ, Φ) := (αΨ, αΦ) (Ψ, Ψ ′ ∈X , Φ, Φ′ ∈Y , α ∈K).
For a linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ), the subset
G (T ) := {(Ψ, T Ψ) ∈X ⊕Y |Ψ ∈D(T )}
(1.1)
of X ⊕Y becomes a subspace of X ⊕Y . This subspace is called the graph
of T .
Theory of Linear Operators
5
For a subset D ⊂D(T ), a subset of Y is deﬁned as follows:
T D := T (D) := {T Ψ|Ψ ∈D}.
If T ∈L(X ) and D ⊂D(T ) is a subspace of X such that T D ⊂D, then
one says that T leaves D invariant. In this case, D is called an invariant
subspace of T .
Two linear operators S, T ∈L(X , Y ) are said to be equal if D(T ) =
D(S) and T Ψ = SΨ, Ψ ∈D(T ). In this case, we write T = S. This type of
equality on operators is called operator equality.
If there exists a subspace D ⊂D(S) ∩D(T ) such that, for all Ψ ∈D,
SΨ = T Ψ, then we say that S is equal to T on D; in this case, we write
as “S = T on D.” Note that this notion of equality on operators is weaker
than that of operator equality.
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be injective, or one to one,
if Ψ1 ̸= Ψ2 (Ψ1, Ψ2 ∈D(T )), then T Ψ1 ̸= T Ψ2 (this is equivalent to that, if
T Ψ1 = T Ψ2 (Ψ1, Ψ2 ∈D(T )), then Ψ1 = Ψ2). In this case, one can deﬁne a
linear operator T −1 ∈L(Y , X ) as follows:
D(T −1) := Ran(T ),
T −1Φ := Ψ, Φ ∈D(T −1),
where Ψ ∈D(T ) is the unique vector satisfying T Ψ = Φ. The operator T −1
is called the inverse of T , or the inverse operator of T . It follows that
T −1T = ID(T ),
T T −1 = IRan(T ).
If Ran(T ) = Y , then T is said to be surjective.
If T is injective and surjective, then T is said to be bijective and is
called a bijection.
It is easy to see that T is injective if and only if the kernel
ker T := {Ψ ∈D(T ) | T Ψ = 0}
of T is equal to {0}.
1.1.2
Eigenvalues
Let T ∈L(X ). In this case, there is a structure which relates T to numbers.
A number λ ∈K is called an eigenvalue of T if there exists a non-zero
vector Ψ ∈D(T ) such that T Ψ = λΨ. Such a vector Ψ is called an eigen-
vector of T with eigenvalue λ. The subspace spanned by all eigenvectors
of T with eigenvalue λ is called the eigenspace of T with eigenvalue λ.
We denote the set of eigenvalues of T by σp(T ) and call it the point
spectrum of T .
6
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is obvious that Ψ is an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue λ if and only
if Ψ ∈ker(T −λ)\{0} (T −λ := T −λIX ).1 Hence, the eigenspace of T
with eigenvalue λ is equal to ker(T −λ).
For a vector space V , we denote its dimension by dim V ∈N ∪{∞}.
The dimension dim ker(T −λ) of the eigenspace ker(T −λ) is called the
multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ. If dim ker(T −λ) = 1 (resp., dim ker(T −
λ) ≥2), then the eigenvalue λ is said to be simple (resp., degenerate).
1.1.3
Sum and product of linear operators
For T1, . . . , Tn ∈L(X , Y ) with n ≥2, the sum n
j=1 Tj = T1 + · · · + Tn in
L(X , Y ) is deﬁned as follows:
D
⎛
⎝
n

j=1
Tj
⎞
⎠:= ∩n
j=1D(Tj),
⎛

⎠(Ψ) :=
n

j=1
TjΨ,
Ψ ∈D
⎛
⎝
n

j=1
Tj
⎞
⎠.
Let Xj (j = 1, . . . , n + 1, n ≥1) be a vector space over K. Then, for
Tj ∈L(Xj, Xj+1) (j = 1, . . . , n), the product Tn · · · T1 ∈L(X1, Xn+1) is
deﬁned as follows:
D(Tn · · · T1) := {Ψ ∈D(T1)|Tk · · · T1Ψ ∈D(Tk+1), k = 1, . . . , n −1},
(Tn · · · T1)Ψ := Tn(Tn−1(· · · (T1Ψ) · · · )),
Ψ ∈D(Tn · · · T1).
For a linear operator T on X (i.e., T ∈L(X )) and n ∈{0}∪N, the nth
power T n of T is deﬁned as follows: T 0 := IX and, for n ≥1, T n := T · · · T
(the n-fold product of T ). We have T 1 = T .
1.1.4
A partial ordering in linear operators
A linear operator S ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be an extension of a linear
operator T ∈L(X , Y ) if D(T ) ⊂D(S) and T Ψ = SΨ, Ψ ∈D(T ). This
relation is written as T ⊂S, or S ⊃T .
Note that S = T if and only if S ⊂T and T ⊂S.
1For subsets A and B of a set X, A\B := {x ∈A|x ̸∈B} = A ∩Bc, where Bc := {x ∈
X|x ̸∈B}, the complement of B.
Theory of Linear Operators
7
Let T ∈L(X , Y ) and D ⊂D(T ) be a subspace. Then, one can deﬁne
a linear operator T ↾D by
D(T ↾D) := D,
(T ↾D)Ψ := T Ψ,
Ψ ∈D.
The operator T ↾D is called the restriction of T to D. It is obvious that
T ↾D ⊂T .
The relation ⊂in L(X , Y ) is a partial ordering.
The partial ordering ⊂in L(X , Y ) is preserved for product operations
of linear operators.
Proposition 1.1. Let S, T ∈L(X , Y ) such that T ⊂S. Let W and Z be
vector spaces over K. Then, for all Q ∈L(W , X ) and R ∈L(Y , Z ),
T Q ⊂SQ,
RT ⊂RS.
Proof. An easy exercise (Problem 2).
□
1.1.5
Commutator
For S, T ∈L(X ), the commutator [S, T ] ∈L(X ) is deﬁned by
[S, T ] := ST −T S.
By the deﬁnition of the sum of linear operators, one has
D([S, T ]) = D(ST ) ∩D(T S).
It follows that
[S, T ] = −[T, S]
(anti-symmetry).
The operators S and T are said to commute if, for all Ψ ∈D([S, T ]),
[S, T ]Ψ = 0. In this case, one says that S commutes with T .
If there exists a subspace D ⊂D([S, T ]) such that [S, T ] = 0 on D, then
we say that S and T commute on D.
The notion of commutator yields a notion of diﬀerential in the space
L(X ) described as follows. For each A ∈L(X ), one can deﬁne a mapping
δA : L(X ) →L(X ) by
δA(X) := [A, X],
X ∈L(X ).
It is easy to see that, for all X, Y ∈L(X ) and α, β ∈K,
δA(αX + βY ) ⊃αδA(X) + βδA(Y ).
(1.2)
8
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In particular, if D(A) = X and D(X) = X = D(Y ), then the operator
equality δA(αX + βY ) = αδA(X) + βδA(Y ) holds. By direct computations,
one can show that, for all X, Y ∈L(X ),
δA(XY ) = δA(X)Y + XδA(Y )
(Leibniz rule)
(1.3)
on D([A, X]Y )∩D(X[A, Y ]). Note that δA(X) and Y (resp., X and δA(Y ))
do not necessarily commute. Formulae (1.2) and (1.3) mean that δA is, in
a sense, a “diﬀerential” mapping on L(X ). The mapping δA is called the
derivation on L(X ) with respect to A.
For calculations of the commutator of operators, the formulae stated in
the following lemma are basic.
Lemma 1.1. Let A, B, Si, Tj ∈L(X ) (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m, n,
m ∈N).

(1.4)

Proof. (i) It is easy to see that, for all A ∈L(X ), [A, m
j=1 βjTj] =
m
j=1 βj[A, Tj] on ∩m
j=1D([A, Tj]). Let A = n

Linear Operators on Banach Space
We assume that the reader is familiar with the elements of Banach space
theory. We next consider the case where the vector spaces X and Y are
Theory of Linear Operators
9
Banach spaces over K with norm ∥·∥X and ∥·∥Y , respectively.2 A Banach
space over C (resp., R) is called a complex (resp., real ) Banach space. In
what follows, we sometimes use the term “Banach space” to mean “Banach
space over K.”
We recall that a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in a Banach space X is said to
converge to a vector Ψ ∈X if limn→∞∥Ψn −Ψ∥X = 0. In this case, one
writes limn→∞Ψn = Ψ.
For a subset D ⊂X , the set
D :=

Ψ ∈X | ∃Ψn ∈D (n ∈N) such that lim
n→∞Ψn = Ψ

is called the closure of D. If D = X , then D is said to be dense in X .
1.2.1
Continuous mappings
Let D be a non-empty subset of X . A mapping f : D →Y is said to be
continuous at Ψ0 ∈D if, for any ε > 0, there exists a constant δ > 0 such
that, for all Ψ ∈D satisfying ∥Ψ −Ψ0∥X < δ, ∥f(Ψ) −f(Ψ0)∥Y < ε. If f is
continuous at every vector in D, then f is said to be continuous on D.
1.2.2
Bounded linear operators
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be bounded if there exists a
constant C ≥0 such that ∥T Ψ∥Y ≤C∥Ψ∥X , Ψ ∈D(T ). In this case, the
ﬁnite quantity
∥T ∥:=
sup
Ψ∈D(T )\{0}
∥T Ψ∥Y
∥Ψ∥X
,
the supremum of {∥T Ψ∥Y /∥Ψ∥X |Ψ ∈D(T )\{0}}, is called the operator
norm (or simply norm) of T . It follows that
∥T Ψ∥Y ≤∥T ∥∥Ψ∥X ,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.5)
Remark 1.2. For an anti-linear operator T from X to Y , the boundedness
and operator norm of T are deﬁned in the same form as above.
For a subspace D of X , we denote by B(D, Y ) the set of bounded
linear operators T ∈L(X , Y ) with D(T ) = D:
B(D, Y ) := {T ∈L(X , Y )|T is bounded}.
(1.6)
2We sometimes omit the subscript X in the norm ∥· ∥X if there is no danger of
confusion.
10
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is easy to see that B(D, Y ) is a vector space and the following hold:
(i) ∥T ∥= 0 (T ∈B(D, Y )) ⇐⇒T = 0D (the zero operator from D to Y ).
(ii) ∥αT ∥= |α| ∥T ∥,
α ∈K, T ∈B(D, Y ).
(iii) (triangle inequality) ∥T + S∥≤∥T ∥+ ∥S∥, T, S ∈B(D, Y ).
Hence, the operator norm ∥· ∥: B(D, Y ) →K is certainly a norm.
Property (iii) above implies the following inequality:
| ∥T ∥−∥S∥| ≤∥T −S∥.
(1.7)
A bounded linear operator is continuous on its domain.
Proposition 1.2. Let T ∈L(X , Y ) be bounded. Then, for every sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(T ) (Ψn ∈D(T ), n ∈N) such that limn→∞Ψn = Ψ ∈D(T ),
limn→∞T Ψn = T Ψ.
Proof. We have ∥T Ψn −T Ψ∥Y = ∥T (Ψn −Ψ)∥Y ≤∥T ∥∥Ψn −Ψ∥X (by
(1.5)) →0 (n →∞).
□
Proposition 1.2 implies that a bounded linear operator is continuous at
the origin 0 ∈X in particular. In fact, the converse is true, as shown in
the following.
Proposition 1.3. If T ∈L(X , Y ) is continuous at the origin, then T is
bounded.
Proof. Based on the present assumption, for any ε > 0, there exists a con-
stant δ > 0 such that, for all Φ ∈D(T ) satisfying ∥Φ∥X < δ, ∥T Φ)∥Y < ε.
Let Ψ ∈D(T )\{0} and Θ := δ(1 + δ)−1Ψ/∥Ψ∥X . Then, Θ ∈D(T ) and
∥Θ∥X < δ. Hence, ∥T Θ∥Y < ε, which gives ∥T Ψ∥Y ≤C∥Ψ∥X with
C := ε(1 + δ)/δ, including the case Ψ = 0. Hence, T is bounded.
□
It is easy to see that a linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is continuous at
the origin if and only if T is continuous on D(T ). Thus, Propositions 1.2
and 1.3 show that the boundedness of a linear operator from one Banach
space to another is equivalent to its continuity.
The following theorem shows that every element in B(X , Y ) (the case
of D = X in B(D, Y )) is uniquely determined by its operation on a dense
subspace of X .
Theorem 1.1. Let T, S ∈B(X , Y ). Suppose that there exists a dense
subspace D of X such that T = S on D. Then, T = S.

n=1 in D (Ψn ∈D, n ∈N) such that limn→∞Ψn = Ψ. Based
on the present assumption, we have T Ψn = SΨn, n ∈N. Since T and S
are bounded, it follows from Proposition 1.2 that limn→∞T Ψn = T Ψ and
limn→∞SΨn = SΨ. Hence, T Ψ = SΨ, ∀Ψ ∈X . Thus, T = S.

Let
B(X ) := B(X , X ),
(1.8)
the set of everywhere deﬁned, bounded linear operators on X .
For the product of bounded linear operators, we have the following
theorem.
Theorem
1.2. Let X1, . . . , Xn+1 (n

Tj ∈B(Xj, Xj+1). Then, Tn · · · T1 ∈B(X1, Xn+1) and ∥Tn · · · T1∥≤
n
j=1 ∥Tj∥.
In particular, if T ∈B(X ), then ∥T n∥≤∥T ∥n.
Proof. An easy exercise (Problem 3).
□
We say that T ∈L(X , Y ) is densely deﬁned if D(T ) is dense in X .
The following theorem is a basic one on a densely deﬁned, bounded linear
operator.
Theorem 1.3 (Extension theorem). Let T
∈
L(X , Y ) be densely
deﬁned and bounded. Then, there exists a unique bounded linear operator
T ∈B(X , Y ) such that T ⊂T. Moreover, ∥T∥= ∥T ∥.
Proof. For each Ψ ∈X , there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(T ) such that
limn→∞Ψn = Ψ. Then, it follows from the boundedness of T that {T Ψn}∞
n=1
is a Cauchy sequence in Y . Hence, the limit TΨ := limn→∞T Ψn exists in
Y . It is easy to show that the limit is independent of the choice of {Ψn}∞
n=1.
Therefore, the operator T is well deﬁned with D( T ) = X . It is obvious
that TΨ = T Ψ, ∀Ψ ∈D(T ) (take Ψn = Ψ, ∀n ∈N). Hence, T ⊂T. We have
∥TΨ∥= limn→∞∥T Ψn∥≤∥T ∥∥Ψ∥. Hence, T is bounded with ∥T∥≤∥T ∥.
On the other hand, for all Ψ ∈D(T ), ∥T Ψ∥= ∥TΨ∥≤∥T∥∥Ψ∥, implying
that ∥T ∥≤∥T∥. Therefore, ∥T∥= ∥T ∥. The uniqueness of T follows from
Theorem 1.1.

Remark 1.3. Theorem 1.3 can be extended to the case where X and
Y are complete normed spaces (see, for example, Reed and Simon, 1972,
Theorem 1.7).

Closed operators
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be closed if, for every sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(T ) (i.e., Ψn ∈D(T ), n ∈N)3 such that limn→∞Ψn = Ψ ∈X
and limn→∞T Ψn = Φ ∈Y , it holds that Ψ ∈D(T ) and Φ = T Ψ.
Proposition 1.4. Every element in B(X , Y ) is closed.
Proof. An easy exercise (Problem 4).
□
In what follows, a closed linear operator is simply called a closed
operator.
For T ∈L(X , Y ), we deﬁne
∥Ψ∥T := ∥Ψ∥X + ∥T Ψ∥Y ,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
It follows that the mapping ∥· ∥T : D(T ) →[0, ∞) is a norm. Let
∥(Ψ, T Ψ)∥G(T ) := ∥Ψ∥T ,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
Then, ∥· ∥G (T ) is a norm of the graph G (T ) of T and G (T ) becomes a
normed space with the norm ∥· ∥G (T ). The norm ∥· ∥G (T ) (or ∥· ∥T ) is
called the graph norm of T .
The domain D(T ) is a normed space with norm ∥· ∥T. It is easy to see
that the normed space (D(T ), ∥· ∥T ) is a Banach space if and only if T is
closed.
The importance of the concept of closed operator is shown in the fol-
lowing theorem.
Theorem 1.4 (Closed graph theorem). Let
T
∈
L(X , Y )
with
D(T ) = X . Then, T is bounded if and only if T is closed.
Proof. See, for example, Reed and Simon (1972), Theorem III.12.
□
An important application of the closed graph theorem is as follows.
Theorem 1.5. Let T ∈L(X , Y ) be closed and bijective. Then, T −1 ∈
B(Y , X ).
Proof. Based on the present assumption, we have T −1 ∈L(Y , X ) and
D(T −1) = Y . According to the closed graph theorem, we need only to
3We sometimes write {Ψn}∞
n=1 ⊂D to mean that {Ψn}∞
n=1 is a sequence in the set D
(i.e., Ψn ∈D, ∀n ∈N).

show that T −1 is closed (then, T −1 is bounded, i.e., T −1 ∈B(Y , X )). Let
{Φn}∞
n=1 be a sequence in Y such that Φn →Φ ∈Y and T −1Φn →Ψ ∈X
(n →∞). Then, letting Ψn = T −1Φn, we have Ψn →Ψ, T Ψn →Φ (n →∞).
Hence, by the closedness of T , Ψ ∈D(T ) and T Ψ = Φ. Hence, Ψ = T −1Φ.
Therefore, T −1 is closed.
□
A linear operator T ∈L(X , Y ) is said to be closable if it has a
closed extension (i.e., there exists a closed operator S ∈L(X , Y ) such
that T ⊂S). It is obvious that every closed operator is closable. In what
follows, a closable linear operator is simply called a closable operator.
Proposition 1.5. Let T ∈L(X , Y ). Then, the following are equivalent:
(i) T is closable.
(ii) If
a
sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1
in
D(T )
satisﬁes
the
condition
that
limn→∞Ψn = 0 and limn→∞T Ψn = Φ ∈Y , then Φ = 0.
Proof. Assume (i). Then, there exists a closed operator S ∈L(X , Y ) such
that T ⊂S. Let {Ψn}∞
n=1 be the sequence assumed in (ii). Then, SΨn →Φ
(n →∞). Since S is closed, it follows that Φ = S0 = 0.
Assume (ii). We deﬁne an operator T as follows:
D(T ) := {Ψ ∈X | ∃Ψn ∈D(T ) (n ∈N) such that lim
n→∞Ψn = Ψ
and ∃lim
n→∞T Ψn}
(1.9)
TΨ := lim
n→∞T Ψn,
Ψ ∈D(T).
(1.10)
Based on the assumed condition (ii), the limit limn→∞T Ψn is independent
of the choice of {Ψn}∞
n=1 and hence T is well deﬁned. For each Ψ ∈D(T ),
one can take Ψn to be equal to Ψ. Then, Ψ ∈D(T ) and TΨ = T Ψ. Hence,
T ⊂T. It is not so diﬃcult to prove that T is closed. Thus, (i) holds.
□
According to Proposition 1.5 and its proof, each closable operator
T ∈L(X , Y ) has the closed extension T deﬁned by (1.9) and (1.10). The
operator T is called the closure of T . It follows that T is the smallest closed
extension of T (i.e., for all closed extensions S of T , T ⊂S). In particular,
if T is closed, then T = T .
It is easy to see that, for two closable operators S, T ∈L(X , Y ), the
following holds:
T ⊂S =⇒T ⊂S.
(1.11)
14
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
This means that the closure operation T →T for the closable operator T
preserves the partial ordering of linear operators.
For an operator T ∈L(X , Y ), a subspace D ⊂D(T ) is called a core
of T if, for each Ψ ∈D(T ), there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D such that
limn→∞Ψn = Ψ and limn→∞T Ψn = T Ψ.
It follows that, in the case where T is closed, a subspace D ⊂D(T ) is a
core of T if and only if T ↾D = T .
The following theorem gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the
sum A + B of two closed operators A, B ∈L(X , Y ) to be closed.
Theorem 1.6. Let A and B be closed operators from X to Y . Then, A+B
is closed if and only if there exists a constant C > 0 such that
∥AΨ∥+ ∥BΨ∥≤C(∥(A + B)Ψ∥+ ∥Ψ∥), Ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B).
(1.12)
Proof. Suppose that A + B is closed. Then, as remarked above, D(A + B)
is a Banach space with the norm ∥· ∥A+B. We deﬁne a linear operator
J : (D(A + B), ∥· ∥A+B) →(D(A), ∥· ∥A) by JΨ := Ψ, Ψ ∈D(A + B).
Then, it is easy to show that J is closed. Hence, according to the closed
graph theorem, J is bounded. Therefore, there exists a constant C1 > 0
such that ∥Ψ∥A ≤C1∥Ψ∥A+B, Ψ ∈D(A + B). This implies that ∥AΨ∥Y ≤
C1(∥Ψ∥X +∥(A+B)Ψ∥Y ), Ψ ∈D(A+B). Similarly, there exists a constant
C2 > 0 such that ∥BΨ∥Y ≤C2(∥Ψ∥X + ∥(A + B)Ψ∥Y ), Ψ ∈D(A + B).
Thus, (1.12) holds with C = C1 + C2. Conversely, it is easy to show that
(1.12) implies the closedness of A + B.
□
Remark 1.4. Theorem 1.6 is sometimes useful in perturbation theory.

Resolvent set and spectra of linear operator
Let X be a complex Banach space. Let T ∈L(X ). The subset of C
ρ(T ) := {λ ∈C|Ran(T −λ) = X , T −λ is injective and
(T −λ)−1 is bounded}
is called the resolvent set of T . For each λ ∈ρ(T ), the bounded operator
(T −λ)−1 is called the resolvent of T at λ.

Mapping properties of T −λ and spectra of T.
The complement of ρ(T )
σ(T ) := C\ρ(T )
is called the spectrum of T . One can also consider the following subsets
of σ(T ):
σr(T ) := {λ ∈C | T −λ is injective and Ran(T −λ) ̸= X },
σc(T ) := {λ ∈C | Ran(T −λ) = X , T −λ is injective and
(T −λ)−1 is unbounded},
which are called, respectively (Fig. 1.1), the residual spectrum and and
continuous spectrum of T .
The four sets ρ(T ), σr(T ), σc(T ) and σp(T ) are mutually disjoint, and
C = ρ(T ) ∪σr(T ) ∪σc(T ) ∪σp(T ),
σ(T ) = σr(T ) ∪σc(T ) ∪σp(T ).
(1.13)
An eigenvalue λ of T is called a discrete eigenvalue of T if the multi-
plicity of λ is ﬁnite and λ is an isolated point of σ(T ). The set of all discrete
eigenvalues of T is called the discrete spectrum of T and denoted by
σd(T ). Obviously, σd(T ) ⊂σp(T ).
A basic theorem on the spectrum of a linear operator is the following.
Theorem 1.7. For all T ∈B(X ), σ(T ) is a non-empty bounded closed
subset in C with σ(T ) ⊂{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤∥T ∥}.
Proof. See, for example, Reed and Simon (1972), p. 191, Corollary.

□
In the case of closed operators, one has the following simple criterion to
identify ρ(T ).
Proposition 1.7. Let T be closed. Then, λ ∈ρ(T ) if and only if T −λ is
bijective.
Proof. Let λ ∈ρ(T ). Then, Ran(T −λ) = X and T −λ is injective,
with (T −λ)−1 being bounded. Using the closedness of T −λ and the
boundedness of (T −λ)−1, one can show that Ran(T −λ) = Ran(T −λ).
Hence, Ran(T −λ) = X . Thus, T −λ is a bijection.
Conversely, suppose that T −λ is bijection. It is easy to see that T −λ
is closed. Hence, according to Theorem 1.5, (T −λ)−1 is bounded. Thus,
λ ∈ρ(T ).

1.2.5
Compact operators
There is an important class of bounded linear operators from the Banach
space X
to the Banach space Y . An operator T
∈L(X , Y ) with
D(T ) = X is said to be compact, or completely continuous, if, for
every bounded sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in X (i.e., Ψn ∈X , ∥Ψn∥X ≤M, n ∈N,
for some constant M > 0), there exists a subsequence {Ψnk}∞
k=1 such that
{T Ψnk}∞
k=1 converges. It follows that a compact operator is bounded. More-
over, T ∈L(X , Y ), with D(T ) = X , is compact if and only if T maps
every bounded set in X to a pre-compact set in Y .
The fundamental properties of a compact operator can be found in
most textbooks on functional analysis. Here, we only recall a basic spectral
property of a compact operator.
Lemma 1.2. Let T be a compact operator on the Banach space X . Then,
σ(T )\{0} consists of only discrete eigenvalues of T , and if σ(T )\{0} is an
inﬁnite set {λn}∞
n=1, then limn→∞λn = 0.

Linear Operators on Hilbert Space
Let H be an inner product space (pre-Hilbert space) over K.4 We denote
its inner product and norm by ⟨, ⟩H (anti-linear, or conjugate linear, in

Hilbert space theory.

the ﬁrst variable and linear in the second variable in the case K = C) and
∥· ∥H , respectively. But we sometimes omit the subscript H if there is
no danger of confusion in the context under consideration. Recall that a
Hilbert space is a complete inner product space and is hence a Banach
space. Therefore, we can apply the theory of linear operators on a Banach
space to linear operators on a Hilbert space.
1.3.1
Dual spaces
Let H be a Hilbert space over K. Then, an element in
H ∗:= B(H , K)
is called a bounded (or continuous) linear functional on H . The set
H ∗is called the dual space of H . The following theorem is important.
Theorem 1.8 (Riesz’s representation theorem). For each F ∈H ∗,
there exists a unique vector ΦF ∈H such that F(Ψ) = ⟨ΦF , Ψ⟩, Ψ ∈H .
Moreover, ∥F∥= ∥ΦF ∥H .
Proof. See textbooks on Hilbert space theory.5

Adjoint operators
Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces over K. For a densely deﬁned linear
operator T ∈L(H1, H2), a linear operator T ∗∈L(H2, H1), called the
adjoint of T , is deﬁned as follows:
D(T ∗) := {Φ ∈H2|∃ΘΦ ∈H1 such that ∀Ψ ∈D(T ), ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩= ⟨ΘΦ, Ψ⟩},
T ∗Φ := ΘΦ, Φ ∈D(T ∗).
If T ∗is densely deﬁned, we denote its adjoint by T ∗∗, i.e., T ∗∗:= (T ∗)∗.
Let T, S ∈L(H1, H2) be densely deﬁned. Then, the following is easily
proved:
T ⊂S =⇒S∗⊂T ∗.
(1.14)
Proposition 1.8. Let T ∈L(H1, H2) be densely deﬁned. Then:
(i) T ∗is closed.
(ii) T is closable if and only if T ∗is densely deﬁned. In that case, T
∗= T ∗
and T = T ∗∗.

Suppose that T ∗is bounded. Then, T ∗∈B(H2, H1). Then, by Proposi-
tion 1.8(ii), T = (T ∗)∗∈B(H1, H2). But this is a contradiction. Thus, T ∗

With regard to the adjoint of the sum (resp., product) of two densely

Hilbert space) be densely deﬁned.
(i) Suppose that T + S is densely deﬁned. Then, (T + S)∗⊃T ∗+ S∗. In
particular, if T is bounded with D(T ) = H1, then (T + S)∗= T ∗+ S∗.
(ii) Suppose that RT ∈L(H1, H3) is densely deﬁned. Then, (RT )∗⊃
T ∗R∗. In particular, if R is bounded with D(R) = H2, then (RT )∗=
T ∗R∗.

Topologies of convergence of bounded linear operators
There are three kinds of concepts on convergence for sequences in
B(H1, H2).
Theory of Linear Operators
19
Let {Tn}∞
n=1 be a sequence in B(H1, H2) and T ∈B(H1, H2).
(C.1) {Tn}∞
n=1 is said to converge to T uniformly or in opera-
tor norm as n →∞if limn→∞∥Tn −T ∥= 0. In this case, we write
u- limn→∞Tn = T , and T is called the uniform limit of {Tn}∞
n=1.
(C.2) {Tn}∞
n=1 is said to converge strongly to T as n →∞if, for all
Ψ ∈H1, limn→∞∥TnΨ −T Ψ∥H2 = 0. In this case, we write s- limn→∞Tn =
T , and T is called the strong limit of {Tn}∞
n=1.
(C.3) {Tn}∞
n=1 is said to converge weakly to T as n →∞if, for all
Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2, limn→∞⟨Φ, TnΨ⟩H2 = ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩H2. In this case, we
write w- limn→∞Tn = T , and T is called the weak limit of {Tn}∞
n=1.
Remark 1.5. The above deﬁnitions also apply to the case where {Tn}∞
n=1
is replaced by a subset {Tλ}λ∈Λ of B(H1, H2) indexed by an open set Λ of
Rd (d ∈N).6 In that case, “n →∞” is replaced by “λ →a” (a ∈Rd). See
also Remark 1.6 in the following.
The logical relations shown in Fig. 1.2 hold.
Remark 1.6. The space B(H1, H2) possesses three kinds of topologies:
(i) (standard one) For each δ > 0 and T ∈B(H1, H2), the set Uδ(T ) :=
{S ∈B(H1, H2)| ∥S −T ∥< δ} is called a δ-neighborhood of T , or
an open ball of radius δ with center T . A subset O of B(H1, H2)
is called an open set if, for each T ∈O, there exists a δ > 0 such
that Uδ(T ) ⊂O. The set of all open sets in B(H1, H2) is called the
uniform operator topology, or the operator-norm topology, on
B(H1, H2). The space B(H1, H2) is a Banach space in this topology.
The convergence in operator norm deﬁned in (C.1) above is due to this
topology.
(ii) For each Ψ ∈H1, a mapping EΨ : B(H1, H2) →H2 is deﬁned by
EΨ(T ) := T Ψ, T ∈B(H1, H2). The strong operator topology on
B(H1, H2) is deﬁned as the weakest topology on B(H1, H2) such that,
for all Ψ ∈H1, EΨ is continuous. In this topology, a net7 {Tλ}λ∈Λ in
uniform convergence =⇒strong convergence =⇒weak convergence

Hierarchy of convergences.
6More generally, Λ may be an open set of a complete metric space.
7In general, a net in a topological space X is deﬁned to be a mapping from a directed
system to X , where a directed system is an index set Λ together with a partial ordering ≺
satisfying that, for each pair (α, β) ∈Λ × Λ, there exists an element γ ∈Λ such that

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
B(H1, H2) is said to converge to an operator T ∈B(H1, H2) if, for
all Ψ ∈H1, ∥TλΨ −T Ψ∥→0 (written Tλ
s→T ). In this case, we say
that {Tλ}λ∈Λ converges to T strongly. The strong convergence of a
sequence deﬁned in (C.2) is a special case of this convergence.
(iii) For each pair (Ψ, Φ) ∈H1 × H2, a mapping EΨ,Φ : B(H1, H2) →C
is deﬁned by EΨ,Φ(T ) := ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩, T ∈B(H1, H2). The weak topol-
ogy on B(H1, H2) is deﬁned as the weakest topology on B(H1, H2)
such that, for all Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2, EΨ,Φ is continuous. In this
topology, a net {Tλ}Λ in B(H1, H2) is said to converge to an operator
T ∈B(H1, H2) if, for all Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2, ⟨Φ, TλΨ⟩→⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩
(written Tλ
w→T ). In this case, we say that {Tλ}λ∈Λ converges to
T weakly. The weak convergence of a sequence deﬁned in (C.3) is a
special case of this convergence.
An elementary fact implied by the uniform convergence of operators in
B(H1, H2) is given by the following proposition.
Proposition 1.12. Let Tn, T ∈B(H1, H22) (n ∈N) and u- limn→∞Tn= T .
Then, limn→∞∥Tn∥= ∥T ∥.
Proof. By (1.7), we have | ∥Tn∥−∥T ∥| ≤∥Tn −T ∥→0 (n →∞). Hence,
the desired result follows.
□
The following fact is useful.
Proposition 1.13. Suppose that Tn, T
∈B(H1, H2) (n ∈
N) and
w- limn→∞Tn = T . Then, {Tn}∞
n=1 is bounded, i.e., supn∈N ∥Tn∥< ∞.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈H1 be arbitrarily ﬁxed and deﬁne Fn : H2 →K by
Fn(Φ) := ⟨TnΨ, Φ⟩H2 , Φ ∈H2. Then, Fn ∈H ∗
2 . It follows from the present
assumption that supn∈N |Fn(Φ)| < ∞. Hence, according to the Banach–
Steinhaus theorem (the principle of uniform boundedness),8 supn∈N
∥Fn∥< ∞, we have ∥Fn∥= ∥TnΨ∥H2. Hence, supn∈N ∥TnΨ∥H2 < ∞.
Since Ψ ∈H1 is arbitrary, it follows from the Banach–Steinhaus theorem
again that supn∈N ∥Tn∥< ∞.
□
γ ≻α and γ ≻β. A net in X is written {xλ}λ∈Λ (xλ ∈X ). A net is a generalization of
a sequence. A net {xλ}λ∈Λ in X is said to converge to a point x ∈X (written xλ →x)
if, for any neighborhood N of x, there is an element λ0 ∈Λ such that xλ ∈N if λ ≻λ0.
8[Banach–Steinhaus theorem] Let X be a Banach space and Y be a normed space.
Let F be a family of everywhere deﬁned, bounded linear operators from X to Y such
that, for each Ψ ∈X, {∥TΨ∥Y |T ∈F} is bounded (i.e., supT ∈F ∥TΨ∥Y < ∞). Then,
{T|T ∈F} is bounded, i.e., supT ∈F ∥T∥< ∞.

u- lim
n→∞SnTn = ST.
(1.15)
(ii) Let s- limn→∞Sn = S and s- limn→∞Tn = T . Then, {SnTn}∞
n=1
strongly converges, and
s- lim
n→∞SnTn = ST.
(1.16)
(iii) Let w- limn→∞Sn = S and s- limn→∞Tn = T . Then, {SnTn}∞
n=1
weakly converges, and
w- lim
n→∞SnTn = ST.
(1.17)
Proof. (i) We have
SnTn −ST = Sn(Tn −T ) + (Sn −S)T.
(1.18)
Hence, by the triangle inequality for operator norm, we have
∥SnTn −ST ∥≤∥Sn∥∥Tn −T ∥+ ∥Sn −S∥∥T ∥
→∥S∥· 0 + 0 · ∥T ∥= 0 (n →∞),
where we have used Proposition 1.12. Hence, we obtain (1.15).
(ii) Strong convergence implies weak convergence. Hence, by Proposition
1.13, C := supn≥1 ∥Sn∥< ∞. Therefore, by (1.18), we have, for all Ψ ∈H1,
∥(SnTn −ST )Ψ∥≤C∥(Tn −T )Ψ∥+ ∥(Sn −S)T Ψ∥→0 (n →∞).
Hence, we obtain (1.16).
(iii) Let Φ ∈H3, Ψ ∈H1. Then, we have by (1.18),
⟨Φ, (SnTn −ST )Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, Sn(Tn −T )Ψ⟩+ ⟨Φ, (Sn −S)T Ψ⟩.
Hence,
| ⟨Φ, (SnTn −ST )Ψ⟩| ≤∥Φ∥∥Sn∥∥(Tn −T )Ψ∥+ | ⟨Φ, (Sn −S)T Ψ⟩|.
By Proposition 1.13, supn≥1 ∥Sn∥< ∞. Hence, the right-hand side of the
inequality above converges to 0 as n →∞. Thus, we obtain (1.17).

Graph and core
It is easy to see that, for two linear operators S and T in L(H1, H2), T = S
if and only if G (S) = G (T ), where, for a linear operator L, G (L) denotes
the graph of L (see (1.1)).
22
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For each A ∈L(H1, H2), the graph G (A) of A is an inner product space
with the inner product of the direct sum Hilbert space H1 ⊕H2.9 It follows
that the inner product space G (A) is closed (hence a Hilbert space) if and
only if T is closed.
For a subset D of a Hilbert space H , we denote by D⊥the orthogonal
complement of D in H :
D⊥:= {Ψ ∈H | ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩H = 0, Φ ∈D}.
It follows that D⊥is a closed subspace of H and D⊥= (D)⊥.
Proposition 1.15. Let T be closed and D ⊂D(T ) be a subspace. Then,
D is a core of T if and only if G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}.
Proof. Let D be a core of T , and let (Ψ, T Ψ) ∈G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ). Then,
for all Φ ∈D, ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩+ ⟨T Φ, T Ψ⟩= 0. Since D is a core of T , there exists a
sequence {Φn}∞
n=1 in D such that Φn →Ψ, T Φn →T Ψ (n →∞). Letting
Φ = Φn in the above equation and taking the limit n →∞, we obtain
∥Ψ∥2 + ∥T Ψ∥2 = 0. Hence, Ψ = 0, T Ψ = 0. Thus, G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}.
Conversely, let G (T
↾D)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}. Then, G (T
↾D) is
dense in G (T ). Hence, for each (Ψ, T Ψ) ∈G (T ), there exists a sequence
{(Ψn, T Ψn)}∞
n=1 in G (T ↾D) such that (Ψn, T Ψn) →(Ψ, T Ψ) (n →∞) in
G (T ). Hence, Ψn ∈D, n ≥1 and Ψn →Ψ, T Ψn →T Ψ (n →∞). Thus, D
is a core of T .
□
The following proposition is often used to identify a smaller core of a
closed operator.
Proposition 1.16. Let T ∈L(H1, H2) be closed and D ⊂D(T ) be a core
of T . Let F ⊂D be a subspace of H1 such that, for each Ψ ∈D, there
exists a sequence {Ψn}n in F satisfying Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ (n →∞).
Then, F is a core of T .
Proof. Let (Φ, T Φ) ∈G (T ↾F)⊥∩G (T ). Then, for all Ψ ∈F,
⟨Φ, Ψ⟩+ ⟨T Φ, T Ψ⟩= 0.
By the property of F assumed and a limiting argument, this equation
extends to all Ψ ∈D, implying that (Φ, T Φ) ∈G (T ↾D)⊥∩G (T ). Hence,
by Proposition 1.15, (Φ, T Φ) = 0. Thus, G (T ↾F)⊥∩G (T ) = {0}. By
Proposition 1.15 again, F is a core of T .
□
9The inner product of (Ψ1, Ψ2) ∈H1 ⊕H2 and (Φ1, Φ2) ∈H1 ⊕H2 is deﬁned by

Unitary equivalence
An operator U ∈B(H1, H2) is said to be unitary if Ran(U) = H2 and
⟨UΨ, UΦ⟩H2 = ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩H1 , Ψ, Φ ∈H1.
It is shown that an operator U ∈B(H1, H2) is unitary if and only if
U ∗U = IH1 and UU ∗= IH2.
A unitary operator is also called a unitary transformation.
Let A ∈L(H1) and B ∈L(H2). Then, A and B are said to be unitarily
equivalent (or A is said to be unitarily equivalent to B) if there exists a
unitary operator U : H1 →H2 satisfying
B = UAU −1.
(1.19)
In this case, one says that B is a unitary transform of A by U.
Proposition 1.17. Suppose that A ∈L(H1) is densely deﬁned and U ∈
B(H1, H2) be a unitary operator. Deﬁne B ∈L(H2) by (1.19). Then, B
is densely deﬁned and B∗= UA∗U −1.
Proof. An exercise (Problem 5).

The
spectra
of
a
linear
operator
are
invariant
under
unitary
transformations.
Theorem 1.9 (Unitary invariance of spectra). Let H1 and H2 be
complex Hilbert spaces (i.e., Hilbert spaces over C). Suppose that A ∈L(H1)
and B ∈L(H2) are unitarily equivalent. Then, the following (i)–(iv) hold:
(i) σ(A) = σ(B).
(ii) σp(A) = σp(B) and, for all λ ∈σp(A), dim ker(A −λ) = dim
ker(B −λ).
(iii) σr(A) = σr(B).
(iv) σc(A) = σc(B).
Proof. Under the present assumption, there exists a unitary operator U :
H1 →H2 such that UAU −1 = B. Hence, for all λ ∈C, U(A −λ)U −1 =
B −λ. The facts (i)–(iv) follow from this operator equality.
□
The following proposition is useful for proving the unitary equivalence
between two closed operators.
Proposition 1.18. Let A and B be closed operators on Hilbert spaces
H1 and H2, respectively. Suppose that there exist a unitary operator
24
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
U : H1 →H2 and a core F ⊂H2 of B such that U −1F is a core of
A and
UAU −1 = B
on F.
(1.20)
Then, the operator equality
UAU −1 = B
(1.21)
holds.
Proof. The operator UAU −1 is closed. Hence, (1.20) implies that B ⊂
UAU −1. Relation (1.20) also gives A = U −1BU on U −1F. Since U −1(F)
is a core of A, it follows that A ⊂U −1BU. Hence, by Proposition 1.1,
UAU −1 ⊂B. Thus, (1.21) holds.

A decomposition theorem
The following theorem is very useful.
Theorem 1.10. Let T be a closed operator from a Hilbert space H to a
Hilbert space K . Then:
(i) The kernel of T , ker T , is closed.
(ii) If D(T ) is dense in addition, then
H = ker T ⊕Ran(T ∗).
(1.22)
Proof. Part (i) is easy to prove. By (i), we have the orthogonal decompo-
sition H = ker T ⊕(ker T )⊥. It is easy to show that Ran(T ∗)⊥= ker T (use
Proposition 1.8) and hence (ker T )⊥= (Ran(T ∗)⊥)⊥= Ran(T ∗). Hence,
we obtain (1.22).
□
We call (1.22) the natural orthogonal decomposition of H with
respect to T .
1.3.7
Relative boundedness
Let S and T be linear operators from a Hilbert space H to a Hilbert space
K such that D(T ) ⊂D(S) and there exist constants a, b ≥0 such that
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ),
where we omit the subscripts H and K in the norms ∥· ∥H and ∥· ∥K .
Then, S is said to be T -bounded, or relatively bounded with respect
Theory of Linear Operators
25
to T . In this case, the constant a is called a relative bound of S with
respect to T . The inﬁmum of the relative bounds of S with respect to T is
called the relative bound of S with respect to T , or simply the T -bound
of S.
If a > 0 can be taken arbitrarily small (b may depend on a) (i.e., the
T -bound of S is zero), then S is said to be inﬁnitesimally small with
respect to T .
Theorem 1.11. Let T be closed and S be closable. Suppose that D(T ) ⊂
D(S) and there exist a constant a ∈[0, 1) (i.e., 0 ≤a < 1) and a constant
b ≥0 such that
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.23)
Then, T + S is closed, and any core of T is a core of T + S.
Proof. By (1.23), for all Ψ ∈D(T ),
∥T Ψ∥≤∥(T + S)Ψ∥+ ∥SΨ∥≤∥(T + S)Ψ∥+ a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥.
Hence,
∥T Ψ∥≤
1
1 −a(∥(T + S)Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥).
(1.24)
Now, let Ψn ∈D(T + S) = D(T ), Ψn →Ψ ∈H and (T + S)Ψn →Φ ∈H
as n →∞. Then, by (1.24), {T Ψn}n is a Cauchy sequence. Hence, by the
closedness of T , Ψ ∈D(T ) = D(T + S) and T Ψ = limn→∞T Ψn. Hence,
limn→∞SΨn = Φ −T Ψ, which means that SΨ = Φ −T Ψ. However, since
D(T ) ⊂D(S) ⊂D(S), it follows that SΨ = Φ −T Ψ, i.e., (T + S)Ψ = Φ.
Thus, T + S is closed.
Let D be any core of T . Then, for each Ψ ∈D(T ), there exists a sequence
{Ψn}n in D such that Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ as n →∞. Then, by (1.23),
SΨn →SΨ (n →∞). Hence, (T + S)Ψn →(T + S)Ψ. Thus, D is a core of
T + S.
□
The following proposition describes an extension of an inequality on
relative boundedness.
Proposition 1.19. Let T be closed and S be closable. Suppose that there
exist a subspace D ⊂D(T )∩D(S) and non-negative constants a, b such that
D is a core of T and
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D.
(1.25)
26
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then, D(T ) ⊂D(S) and
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.26)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(T ). Then, there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1, with Ψn ∈D,
such that Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ as n →∞. By (1.25), we have
∥SΨn∥≤a∥T Ψn∥+ b∥Ψn∥,
n ∈N
(1.27)
and
∥SΨn −SΨm∥≤a∥T Ψn −T Ψm∥+ b∥Ψn −Ψm∥,
n, m ∈N.
The
latter
implies
that
{SΨn}∞
n=1
is
a
Cauchy
sequence.
Hence,
limn→∞SΨn exists. Therefore, Ψ ∈D(S) and limn→∞SΨn = SΨ. Hence,
D(T ) ⊂D(S). Taking the limit n →∞in (1.27), we obtain (1.26).

1.3.8
Hermitian, symmetric and self-adjoint operators
Let H be a Hilbert space over K.
A linear operator T on H is said to be Hermitian if, for all Ψ, Φ ∈
D(T ), ⟨Ψ, T Φ⟩= ⟨T Ψ, Φ⟩(Hermitian property).
A densely deﬁned Hermitian operator T on H is called a symmetric
operator. Hence, T is symmetric if and only if D(T ) is dense and T ⊂T ∗.
A densely deﬁned linear operator T on H is said to be self-adjoint if
T = T ∗.
By Proposition 1.8(i), a self-adjoint operator is closed.
Remark 1.7. Some authors use the term “Hermitian operator” to mean
“symmetric operator,” and vice versa. In many books and articles on phys-
ical quantum theory, little attention is given to distinguish among the three
kinds of operators deﬁned above and their domains (Fig. 1.3). It is obvious
that a self-adjoint operator is a closed symmetric operator. But it has to
be emphasized that the converse is not true, i.e., a closed symmetric opera-
tor is not necessarily self-adjoint if the Hilbert space under consideration is
inﬁnite-dimensional. Also, the following theorem should be kept in mind.
Theorem 1.12 (The Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem).
An everywhere deﬁned symmetric operator on a Hilbert space is bounded
(hence, it is a bounded self-adjoint operator).

Theory of Linear Operators

Proof. This follows from an application of the closed graph theorem (Theo-
rem 1.4). Let T be an everywhere deﬁned symmetric operator on a Hilbert
space H . Let {Ψn}∞
n=1 be a sequence in H such that Ψn →Ψ ∈H
and T Ψn →η ∈H as n →∞. By the Hermitian property of T , for all
Φ ∈H , ⟨Φ, T Ψn⟩= ⟨T Φ, Ψn⟩. Hence, taking the limit n →∞, we obtain
⟨Φ, η⟩= ⟨T Φ, Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, T Ψ⟩. Hence, η = T Ψ. Therefore, T is closed. Thus,
according to the closed graph theorem, T is bounded.
□
This theorem implies that an unbounded symmetric operator is not
everywhere deﬁned.
Hermiteness (resp., symmetricity, self-adjointness) of a linear operator
is a unitarily invariant property.
Proposition 1.20. Let H and K be Hilbert spaces over K and U : H →
K be a unitary operator. Let A ∈L(H ) and B := UAU −1. Then:
(i) If A is Hermitian, then B is Hermitian.
(ii) If A is symmetric, then B is symmetric.
(iii) If A is self-adjoint, then B is self-adjoint.
Proof. (i) Let A be Hermitian. Then, for all Φ, Ψ ∈D(B), ⟨Φ, BΨ⟩=

U −1Φ, AU −1Ψ

=

AU −1Φ, U −1Ψ

= ⟨BΦ, Ψ⟩. Hence, B is Hermitian.
(ii) Let A be symmetric. Then, A is densely deﬁned and A ⊂A∗. Hence,
by Proposition 1.1, B ⊂UA∗U −1. By Proposition 1.17, UA∗U −1 = B∗.
Therefore, B ⊂B∗. Thus, B is symmetric.
(iii) This follows from Proposition 1.17.
□
A linear operator S on H is called a symmetric extension of a linear
operator T on H if S is symmetric and S is an extension of T : T ⊂S.
A basic property of a self-adjoint operator is as follows.
Theorem 1.13. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H and
S be a symmetric extension of T . Then, S = T .
Proof. Under the present assumption, we have T ⊂S. Hence, by (1.14),
S∗⊂T ∗= T . Therefore, S∗⊂T ⊂S. But S ⊂S∗since S is symmetric.
Thus, S∗= T = S.
□
Theorem 1.13 is rephrased as “a self-adjoint operator has no non-trivial
symmetric extension.”
It follows from Proposition 1.8(ii) that a symmetric operator is closable.
A symmetric operator S is said to be essentially self-adjoint if the closure
S is self-adjoint.
28
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The expression “essentially self-adjoint” is justiﬁed by the following
proposition.
Proposition 1.21. Suppose that a symmetric operator S is essentially self-
adjoint. Then, S is the unique self-adjoint extension of S.
Proof. Let T be any self-adjoint extension of S: S ⊂T . Then, by (1.11)
and the closedness of T , S ⊂T . Since S is self-adjoint, it has no non-trivial
symmetric extension (Theorem 1.13). Hence, S = T .
□
Let T be a Hermitian operator on H . Then, for all Ψ ∈D(T ), ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩is
a real number. If there exists a constant γ ∈R such that, for all Ψ ∈D(T ),
⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩≥γ∥Ψ∥2, then T is said to be bounded from below, or, simply,
bounded below. In this case, we write T ≥γ, or γ ≤T . In particular, if
γ > 0 (resp., γ = 0), then T is said to be strictly positive (resp., positive,
or non-negative).
If −T is bounded from below with −T ≥−b (b ∈R), then T is said
to be bounded from above. In this case, we write T ≤b, or b ≥T . In
particular, if b < 0 (resp., b = 0), then T is said to be strictly negative
(resp., negative, or non-positive).
If T is bounded from below or bounded from above, then T is said to
be semi-bounded.
A non-negative Hermitian operator has the following good property.
Proposition 1.22. Let T be a non-negative Hermitian operator. Then, for
all Ψ ∈D(T ) and a > 0,
∥(T + a)Ψ∥2 ≥∥T Ψ∥2 + a2∥Ψ∥2.
(1.28)
Proof. This follows from the expansion ∥(T + a)Ψ∥2
=
∥T Ψ∥2 +
2aRe ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩+ a2∥Ψ∥2 and ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩≥0.
□
If T and S are Hermitian operators on H satisfying D(T ) ⊂D(S) and
⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩≤⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩, Ψ ∈D(T ), then we write S ≤T . This is equivalent to
(T −S) ↾D(T ) ≥0.
The relation ≤in the set of symmetric operators is a partial ordering.
Proposition 1.23. Let H be a complex Hilbert space (i.e., a Hilbert space
over C) and T be a Hermitian operator on H . Then, for all z ∈C\R, A−z
is injective and (A −z)−1 is bounded with
∥(A −z)−1∥≤
1
|Im z|,
(1.29)
where Im z denotes the imaginary part of z.
Theory of Linear Operators
29
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(A) and z ∈C. Then, using the Hermiteness of A, one
can show that ∥(A −z)Ψ∥2 = ∥(A −Re z)Ψ∥2 + |Im z|2∥Ψ∥2, where Re z
denotes the real part of z. Hence, ∥(A −z)Ψ∥2 ≥|Im z|2∥Ψ∥2. This implies
that if Imz ̸= 0, then A −z is injective and (A −z)−1 is bounded with
(1.29).

The following theorem states the basic spectral properties of a self-

(i) The spectrum σ(T ) is a non-empty closed subset of R. In particular,
C\R ⊂ρ(T ).
(ii) The residual spectrum σr(T ) is empty (Problem 9) and hence
σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪σc(T ).
(iii) Let λ ∈R. Then, λ ∈σ(T ) if and only if there exists a sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1 of unit vectors in D(T ) (∥Ψn∥= 1, n ≥1) such that

Trace class operator
Let H


n=1
⟨en, T en⟩,
where {en}dim H
n=1
is an orthonormal basis of H . It is shown that Tr T is
independent of the choice of orthonormal bases of H . The number Tr T is
called the trace of T .
We next consider the case where H is an inﬁnite-dimensional separable
Hilbert space. There are two cases:
(a) T ≥0: In this case, for any complete orthonormal system (CONS)

n=1 of H ,
Tr T :=

(b) T is not necessarily non-negative: In this case, T ∗T is a non-negative
bounded self-adjoint operator. Hence, there exists a unique non-negative
self-adjoint operator |T | ∈B(H ) such that |T |2 = T ∗T . The operator |T |
is called the absolute value, or the modulus of T .
If Tr |T | < ∞, then T is said to be a trace class. In this case,
∞
n=1 | ⟨en, T en⟩| < ∞, for all CONSs {en}∞
n=1 of H and ∞
n=1 ⟨en, T en⟩
is independent of the choice of {en}∞
n=1. Hence, one can deﬁne
Tr T :=
∞

n=1
⟨en, T en⟩.
This complex number is called the trace of T .
We denote by T1(H ) the set of all trace class operators on H . The
following proposition is well known.10
Proposition 1.24. The set T1(H ) is a subspace of B(H ). Moreover, for
all T ∈T1(H ) and S ∈B(H ), T ∗, T S and ST are in T1(H ) and
Tr (T S) = Tr (ST ).
The following proposition is easily proved.
Proposition 1.25. Let A, B ∈B(H ) be self-adjoint such that A ≥B ≥0.
Then, Tr A ≥Tr B.
1.3.10
Orthogonal projections
Let M be a closed subspace of a Hilbert space H . Then, according to the
projection theorem, for each Ψ ∈H , there exists a unique pair (ΨM, ΨM ⊥)
of vectors ΨM ∈M and ΨM ⊥∈M ⊥such that
Ψ = ΨM + ΨM ⊥.
Then, one can deﬁne a linear operator PM on H by
D(PM ) = H ,
PMΨ := ΨM.
It follows that PM is a bounded self-adjoint operator satisfying P 2
M =
PM . It is obvious that Ran(PM ) = M . The operator PM is called the
orthogonal projection onto M .
10See, for example, Kato (1967), Section 49, and Reed and Simon (1980), Section VI.6.

The notion of orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace is general-
ized as follows. A bounded linear operator P ∈B(H ) is called an orthog-
onal projection if P 2 = P (idempotent) and P ∗= P (self-adjoint). It
follows that P ≥0 and Ran(P) is a closed subspace of H . Hence, P is the
orthogonal projection onto the closed subspace Ran(P).
Proposition 1.26. Let P be an orthogonal projection on a Hilbert space H
such that Ran(P) is ﬁnite-dimensional. Then, for any orthonormal system

n=1 | ⟨fj, en⟩|2 ≤∥fj∥2 = 1. Hence, (1.30)

that Ran(Pj) is inﬁnite-dimensional. Then, for each m ∈N, there exists
an ONS {ei}m

Weak commutator
There is a weak form of the commutation relation. Let H be a Hilbert
space and A, B ∈L(H ) be densely deﬁned. If there exist a dense subspace
D of H and an operator C ∈L(H ) such that D ⊂D(A)∩D(A∗)∩D(B)∩
D(B∗) ∩D(C) and
⟨A∗Φ, BΨ⟩−⟨B∗Φ, AΨ⟩= ⟨Φ, CΨ⟩,
Φ, Ψ ∈D,
then we say that (A, B) has a weak commutator C on D. Since D is
dense, C is uniquely determined on D. Based on this fact, we write
C ↾D = [A, B]D
w .
Hence,
⟨A∗Φ, BΨ⟩−⟨B∗Φ, AΨ⟩=

Φ, [A, B]D
w Ψ

,
Φ, Ψ ∈D.
(1.32)
If D ⊂D(AB) ∩D(BA), then it follows that
[A, B]D
w = [A, B] ↾D.
In this sense, the weak commutator of two linear operators is regarded as
a weak version of the commutator of two linear operators.

Direct Sum Operators
Let H1, . . . , HN, with N ≥2, be complex Hilbert spaces and
⊕N
j=1Hj = {Ψ = (Ψ1, . . . , ΨN)|Ψj ∈Hj, j = 1, . . . , N}
be their direct sum Hilbert space.11 Let Aj be a linear operator on Hj.
Then, the direct sum operator ⊕N
j=1Aj on ⊕N
j=1Hj is deﬁned as follows:
D(⊕N
j=1Aj) := ⊕N
j=1D(Aj),
(⊕N
j=1Aj)Ψ := (A1Ψ1, . . . , ANΨN),
Ψ ∈D(⊕N
j=1Aj).
Theorem 1.15. Let A := ⊕N
j=1Aj. Then:
(i) For all z ∈C, ker(A −z) = ⊕N
j=1 ker(Aj −z).
(ii) σ(A) = ∪N
j=1σ(Aj).
(iii) σp(A) = ∪N
j=1σp(Aj).
Proof. (i) We have A−z = ⊕N
j=1(Aj −z) · · · (∗), which implies the desired
result.
(ii) The statement is equivalent to ρ(A) = ∩N
j=1ρ(Aj). Hence, we prove
the latter. Let z ∈ρ(A). Then, A−z is injective, and (A−z)−1 is bounded.
Hence, by (i), each Aj −z is injective. The boundedness of (A −z)−1
implies that, for a constant C > 0, ∥(A −z)Ψ∥≥C∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈D(A).
Note that
∥(A −z)Ψ∥2 =
N

j=1
∥(Aj −z)Ψj∥2,
Ψ ∈D(A) · · · (∗∗).
Fixing j = 1, . . . , N and taking Ψ ∈D(A) as Ψk = δjkη (k = 1, . . . , N), with
η ∈D(Aj) being arbitrary, we obtain ∥(Aj−z)η∥≥C∥η∥. Hence, (Aj−z)−1
is bounded. Moreover, Ran(A −z) is dense in ⊕N
j=1Hj. According to this
property and (∗), for each j = 1, . . . , N, Ran(Aj −z) is dense in Hj. Hence,
z ∈ρ(Aj). Thus, ρ(A) ⊂∩N
j=1ρ(Aj).
Conversely, let z ∈∩N
j=1ρ(Aj). Then, each Aj −z is injective, with
(Aj −z)−1 being bounded and Ran(Aj −z) is dense in Hj. The former
implies that A−z is injective, with (A−z)−1 being bounded (use (∗∗)), while
11The inner product is deﬁned by ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩:= N
j=1 ⟨Ψj, Φj⟩(Ψ, Φ ∈⊕N
j=1Hj). Also, in
the case where H1, . . . , HN are real Hilbert spaces, the direct sum Hilbert space ⊕N
j=1Hj
is deﬁned in the same form.
34
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
the latter implies that Ran(A −z) is dense in ⊕N
j=1Hj. Hence, z ∈ρ(A).
Thus, ∩N
j=1ρ(Aj) ⊂ρ(A).
(ii) This easily follows from (i).

Self-Adjoint Operators and Related Subjects
In what follows, we mean by a Hilbert space a complex Hilbert space unless
otherwise stated.
In this section, we present facts on self-adjoint operators and related
subjects which are used later in this book.
1.5.1
Criteria on (essential) self-adjointness for symmetric
operators
In this section, we summarize criteria for a symmetric operator to be (essen-
tially) self-adjoint. As usual, we denote by i the imaginary unit.
Proposition 1.28. Let T be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space H .
Then, the following are equivalent:
(i) T is self-adjoint.
(ii) T is closed and ker(T ∗± i) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T ± i) = H .
Proof. See, for example, Reed and Simon (1972), Theorem VIII.3, or Arai
(1997a, 2014b), Theorem 4.1.
□
A simple application of Proposition 1.28 is given as follows.
Theorem 1.16. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, for all
n ∈N, T n is self-adjoint.
Proof. Let αk := eiπ/2ne2πik/n, k = 0, . . . , n −1, so that αn
k = i, k = 0,
. . . , n −1. Then, T n −i = n−1
k=0(T −αk). Each αk is not real. Hence αk
and α∗
k are in ρ(T ). Therefore, A := (T −αn−1)−1 · · · (T −α0)−1 is in
B(H ) and A∗= (T −α∗
0)−1 · · · (T −α∗
n−1)−1, which is injective. Hence,
using the natural orthogonal decomposition of H with respect to A∗(see
(1.22) or a general fact (Problem 7), Ran(A) is dense in H . But Ran(A) ⊂
D(T n). Hence, D(T n) is dense. It follows that T n is symmetric. For all
Theory of Linear Operators
35
Φ ∈H , we have (T n −i)AΦ = Φ. Hence, Ran(T n −i) = H . Similarly,
one can show that Ran(T n + i) = H . Thus, by Proposition 1.28, T n is
self-adjoint.
□
In the case of a non-negative symmetric operator T , one has simpler
criteria for T to be self-adjoint.
Proposition 1.29. Let T be a non-negative symmetric operator on a
Hilbert space H . Then, the following are equivalent:
(i) T is self-adjoint.
(ii) T is closed, and ker(T ∗+ 1) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T + 1) = H .
Proof. (i) =⇒(ii). Assume (i). Then, T is closed. Let Ψ ∈ker(T ∗+ 1).
Then, by (i), (T + 1)Ψ = 0. Hence, T Ψ = −Ψ. Therefore, ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩=
−∥Ψ∥2 ≤0. But the left-hand side is non-negative due to the non-negativity
of T . Hence, ∥Ψ∥2 = 0, implying Ψ = 0. Thus, ker(T ∗+ 1) = {0}.
(ii) =⇒(iii). Assume (ii). Then, by the natural orthogonal decomposi-
tion H = ker(T ∗+ 1) ⊕Ran(T + 1) with respect to T ∗+ 1 (see (1.22)),
we have H = Ran(T + 1). By inequality (1.28), we have ∥(T + 1)Ψ∥≥
∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈D(T ). Using this inequality and the closedness of T , one can
show that Ran(T + 1) is closed. Hence, (iii) holds.
(iii) =⇒(i). Assume (iii). Since D(T ) ⊂D(T ∗) by the symmetry of T ,
we need only to show that D(T ∗) ⊂D(T ). Let Ψ ∈D(T ∗). Then, there
exists a vector Φ ∈D(T ) such that (T + 1)Φ = (T ∗+ 1)Ψ. Hence, (T ∗+ 1)
(Ψ −Φ) = 0. On the other hand, by the natural orthogonal decomposition
of H with respect to T ∗+ 1, we have ker(T ∗+ 1) = {0}. Hence, Ψ = Φ.
Hence, Φ ∈D(T ). Therefore, D(T ∗) ⊂D(T ).
□
We also need criteria for a symmetric operator to be essentially self-
adjoint.
Proposition 1.30. Let T be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space H .
Then, the following are equivalent:
(i) T is essentially self-adjoint.
(ii) ker(T ∗± i) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T ± i) are dense in H .
Proof. This follows from Proposition 1.28.
□
36
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proposition 1.31. Let T be a non-negative symmetric operator on a
Hilbert space H . Then, the following are equivalent:
(i) T is essentially self-adjoint.
(ii) ker(T ∗+ 1) = {0}.
(iii) Ran(T + 1) is dense in H .
Proof. This follows from Proposition 1.29
□
A symmetric operator T is said to be essentially self-adjoint on a dense
subspace D ⊂D(T ) if T ↾D (the restriction of T to D) is essentially
self-adjoint. In this case, one has T = T ↾D.
Proposition 1.32. Let T be a self-adjoint operator and D be a dense sub-
space such that D ⊂D(T ). Then, D is a core of T if and only if T is
essentially self-adjoint on D.
Proof. The “if part” is obvious. Let D be a core of T . Then, by Proposition
1.28(iii), for each Φ ∈H , there exists a vector Ψ ∈D(T ) such that (T +
i)Ψ = Φ. Since D is a core of T , there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D such
that Ψn →Ψ and T Ψn →T Ψ as n →∞. Hence, (T + i)Ψn →(T + i)Ψ = Φ
as n →∞. This means that Ran((T + i) ↾D) is dense in H . Similarly,
one can show that Ran((T −i) ↾D) is dense in H . Thus, by Proposition
1.30(iii), T is essentially self-adjoint on D.
□
The following proposition may be useful to prove the essential self-
adjointness of a symmetric operator on a suitable subspace.
Proposition 1.33. Let H and K be Hilbert spaces and D be a dense
subspace of K . Let T and S be symmetric operators on H and K , respec-
tively, satisfying the following (i) and (ii):
(i) S is essentially self-adjoint on D.
(ii) There exists a unitary transformation U : H →K such that U −1D ⊂
D(T ) and, for all Ψ ∈D, UT U −1Ψ = SΨ.
Then, T is essentially self-adjoint on U −1D, and the operator equality
UTU −1 = S holds.
Proof. By (ii), we have (S ±i)D = U(T ±i)U −1D. By (i) and Proposition
1.30, (S ± i)D are dense in K . Hence, U(T ± i)U −1D are dense in K .
Since a unitary operator maps a dense subspace to a dense subspace, it
follows that (T ±i)U −1D are dense in H . Thus, by Proposition 1.30 again,
T is essentially self-adjoint on U −1D. We have UTU −1 ⊃S ↾D. Hence,
Theory of Linear Operators
37
UTU −1 ⊃S. Since both sides are self-adjoint and a self-adjoint operator
has no non-trivial self-adjoint extension, the operator equality UTU −1 = S
holds.
□
1.5.2
The Kato–Rellich theorem
We recall a fundamental theorem in perturbation theory of self-adjoint
operators. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H and S
be a symmetric operator on H . Then, a natural question is: under what
condition is T + S self-adjoint? A basic theorem on this question is given
as follows.
Theorem 1.17 (The Kato–Rellich theorem). Let
T
and
S
be as
above. Suppose that S is T -bounded with a relative bound less than 1, i.e.,
D(T ) ⊂D(S) and there exist constants a ∈[0, 1) and b ≥0 such that
∥SΨ∥≤a∥T Ψ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(T ).
(1.33)
Then, T + S is self-adjoint and essentially self-adjoint on any core of T .
Moreover, if T is bounded from below with T ≥γ (γ ∈R), then T + S is
bounded from below with
T + S ≥γ −max{b/(1 −a), a|γ| + b}.
(1.34)
Proof. See, for example, Arai (2006b), Theorem 2.7; Kato (1976), p. 287,
Theorem 4.3; or Reed and Simon (1975), Theorem X.12.
□
Corollary 1.1. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H and S be a symmet-
ric operator on H such that D(T ) ⊂D(S).
(i) If S is inﬁnitesimally small with respect to T , then T +S is self-adjoint
and essentially self-adjoint on any core of T .
(ii) If S is bounded, then T + S is self-adjoint and essentially self-adjoint
on any core of T . Moreover, if T ≥γ (γ ∈R), then T + S ≥γ −∥S∥.
Proof. In part (i) (resp., (ii)), one can take a < 1 (resp., a = 0 < 1,
b = ∥S∥) in (1.33). Hence, by Theorem 1.17, one obtains the desired
results.
□
1.5.3
Multiplication operators
Let (X, Σ) be a measurable space, i.e., X is a non-empty set and Σ is a
σ-ﬁeld consisting of subsets of X, and μ be a σ-ﬁnite measure on (X, Σ).12
38
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We denote by L2(X, dμ) := L2(X, Σ, dμ), the complex Hilbert space of
equivalence classes of square integrable functions on (X, Σ, μ):
L2(X, dμ) :=

f : X →C ∪{±∞}, Σ-measurable|

X
|f(x)|2dμ(x) < ∞

,
with the equivalence relation f ∼g for the Σ-measurable functions f and g
on X deﬁned as follows: f ∼g
def
⇐⇒f(x) = g(x), μ-a.e. (almost everywhere)
x ∈X. As usual, we write f = g for f ∼g. The inner product of L2(X, dμ)
is deﬁned as by
⟨f, g⟩:=

X
f(x)∗g(x)dμ(x),
f, g ∈L2(X, dμ).
Example 1.1. In the case where X is a Borel subset M of Rn (n ∈N),
Σ = {B ∩M|B ∈Bn} (Bn is the Borel ﬁeld of Rn) and μ is the
n-dimensional Lebesgue measure μn
L (dμn
L(x) = dxn), we write L2(X, dμ) =
L2(M, dxn) = L2(M).
Let F : X →C ∪{±∞} be a Σ-measurable function such that |F(x)| <
∞for μ-a.e. x ∈X. Then, one can deﬁne a linear operator MF on L2(X, μ)
as follows:
D(MF ) :=

f ∈L2(X, dμ)


X
|F(x)f(x)|2dμ(x) < ∞

,
(MF f)(x) := F(x)f(x),
μ-a.e. x ∈X, f ∈D(MF ).
The operator MF is called the multiplication operator by the function F.
The subset
ess.ranμ(F) := {λ ∈C|∀ε > 0, μ({x ∈X| |F(x) −λ| < ε}) > 0}
is called the essential range of F with respect to μ. It is easy to see that
ess.ranμ(F) is closed.
Theorem 1.18. The multiplication operator MF is a densely deﬁned closed
operator. Moreover, the following hold:
(i) (MF )∗= MF ∗.
(ii) If F(x) ∈R for μ-a.e. x ∈X, then F is self-adjoint.
(iii) σ(MF ) = ess.ranμ(F).
12We assume that the reader is familiar with the elements of measure theory and
Lebesgue integration.
Theory of Linear Operators
39
Proof. The implication (i) =⇒(ii) is obvious. For proofs of (i) and (iii),
see standard textbooks on linear operators on Hilbert spaces, for example,
Arai and Ezawa (1999a), pp. 126–130.
□
In applications, the following fact on the essential range of F is useful.
Proposition 1.34. Consider the case where X is a topological space, Σ is
the Borel ﬁeld generated by all the open sets of X and, for all non-empty
open sets O ⊂X, μ(O) > 0. Then, for all continuous functions F : X →C,
ess.ranμ(F) = F(X),
where F(X) := {F(x)|x ∈X}, the range of the function F.
Proof. An exercise (Problem 10).
□
With regard to multiplication operators on L2(Rd) (d ∈N), Theorem
1.18 and Proposition 1.34 immediately yield the following result.
Corollary 1.2. Let F ∈C(Rd) (the set of complex-valued continuous func-
tions on Rd). Then, the multiplication operator MF on L2(Rd) is a densely
deﬁned closed operator, and
σ(MF ) = F(Rd).
1.5.4
Spectral measures and functional calculus
(A) Spectral measures
Let (X, Σ) be a measurable space and H be a Hilbert space. We denote
by P(H ) be the set of all orthogonal projections on H . A mapping E :
Σ →P(H ); Σ ∋B →E(B) ∈P(H ) (or a family of orthogonal projections
{E(B)|B ∈Σ} on H ) is called a spectral measure on (X, Σ), or a
projection-valued measure on (X, Σ), if the following hold:
(E.1) E(X) = I (the identity on H ).
(E.2) (complete additivity) If {Bn|n ∈N} is a family of mutually disjoint
Σ-measurable sets, i.e., Bn ∈Σ, n ∈N and, for n ̸= m, Bn ∩Bm = ∅
(empty set), then
E(∪∞
n=1Bn) = s- lim
N→∞
N

n=1
E(Bn),
where s-lim means the strong limit.
40
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We summarize some basic properties of a spectral measure as follows.
Proposition 1.35. Let E be a spectral measure on (X, Σ). Then, the fol-
lowing hold:
(i) E(∅) = 0.
(ii) (ﬁnite additivity) Let Bn ∈Σ (n = 1, . . . , N, N ∈N) such that, for
n ̸= m, Bn ∩Bm = ∅. Then,
E(B1 ∪· · · ∪BN) =
N

n=1
E(Bn).
(1.35)
(iii) (orthogonality) If B, C ∈Σ and B ∩C = ∅, then E(B)E(C) = 0.
(iv) If B ⊂C, B, C ∈Σ, then E(C)E(B) = E(B)E(C) = E(B).
(v) (product property) For all B, C ∈Σ, E(B)E(C) = E(B ∩C).
(vi) (commutativity) For all B, C ∈Σ, E(B)E(C) = E(C)E(B).
(vii) (monotonicity) If B ⊂C, B, C ∈Σ, then E(B) ≤E(C).
Proof. (i) Taking Bn = ∅in (E.2) (n = 1, 2, . . .), we have E(∅) =
s- limN→∞NE(∅), which implies that E(∅) = 0.
(ii) Taking Bn = ∅, n > N in (E.2) and using (i), we obtain (1.35).
(iii) By (1.35) with N = 2, we have E(B ∪C) = E(B) + E(C).
Taking the square of this equation and using E(A)2 = E(A), A ∈Σ,
we have E(B ∪C) = E(B) + E(B)E(C) + E(C)E(B) + E(C). Hence,
E(B)E(C) + E(C)E(B) = 0 · · · (∗). Multiplying both sides by E(B), we
obtain E(B)E(C)E(B) = 0 · · · (∗∗). Multiplying (∗) by E(B) from the left
and using (∗∗), we obtain E(B)E(C) = 0.
(iv) We have C = B + (C\B). Hence, by (ii), E(C) = E(B) + E(C\B).
Multiplying this equation by E(B) from the left (resp., the right) and using
E(B)E(C\B) = 0 = E(C\B)E(B) by (iii), we obtain that E(B)E(C) =
E(B) (resp., E(C)E(B) = E(B)).
(v) We have
B ∪C = (B ∩C) ∪D ∪F,
D := B\C, F := C\B.
Hence, by (ii), E(B ∪C) = E(B ∩C) + E(D) + E(F). Multiplying this
equation by B (resp., C) from the left and using (iv), we obtain
E(B) = E(B ∩C) + E(D),
E(C) = E(B ∩C) + E(F).
Hence, it follows that E(B)E(C) = E(B ∩C).
(vi) This follows from (v).
(vii) We have by (ii) that E(C) = E(B) + E(C\B). Since E(C\B) ≥0,
it follows that E(C) ≥E(B).

Proposition 1.35(vi) shows that the set {E(B)|B ∈Σ} is a family of
commuting orthogonal projections on H .
(B) Spectral measures on the d-dimensional Borel-measurable space
A spectral measure on the d-dimensional Borel-measurable space (Rd, Bd)
(the case where X = Rd and Σ = Bd) is called a d-dimensional spectral
measure, or a resolution of identity.
Let E be a d-dimensional spectral measure. Then, it follows from (E.1)
and (E.2) that, for every monotone increasing sequence {Rn}∞
n=1 of the
Borel sets Rn ∈Bd, n ∈N such that ∪∞
n=1Rn = Rd,
s- lim
n→∞E(Rn) = I.
(1.36)
Indeed, letting B1 = R1, Bn := Rn\Rn−1 (n ≥2), one has Bn ∩Bm = ∅,
n ̸= m, and ∪∞
n=1Bn = Rd. Hence, by (E.2) and (E.1),
s- lim
N→∞
N

n=1
E(Bn) = E(Rd) = I.
However, by (E.2) again, N
n=1 E(Bn) = E(RN). Hence, (1.36) holds.
The smallest closed set C0 ⊂Rd such that E(C0) = I is called the
support of E. We write C0 = supp E. Hence, E(supp E) = I.
The following proposition may be used to identify supp E.
Proposition 1.36. Let a ∈Rd and, for r > 0,
Br(a) := {x ∈Rd| |x −a| < r},
the d-dimensional open ball with center a and radius r. Then, a ∈supp E
if and only if, for every ε > 0, E(Bε(a)) ̸= 0.
Proof. Suppose that there exists a constant δ > 0 such that E(Bδ(a)) = 0.
Then, E(Bδ(a)c) = I. Since Bδ(a)c is closed, it follows that supp E ⊂
Bδ(a)c. Hence, a ̸∈supp E. Thus, if a ∈supp E, then, for every ε > 0,
E(Bε(a)) ̸= 0.
Suppose that a ̸∈supp E. Then, since (supp E)c is an open set,
there exists a constant δ > 0 such that Bδ(a) ⊂(supp E)c. Since
E((supp E)c) = 0, it follows from (E.4) that E(Bδ(a)) = 0.

D(E(B)) := L2(Rd),
E(B)f := χF −1(B)f,
f ∈L2(Rd),

denotes the characteristic function of A:
χA(x) :=

if x ̸∈A

It is easy to see that E(B) is an orthogonal projection on L2(Rd) and
that E : R →P(L2(Rd)) is a one-dimensional spectral measure. Using
Proposition 1.36, one can show that, if F is continuous on Rd, then
supp E = F(Rd), the closure of the image F(Rd) := {F(x)x ∈Rd} of F.
(C) Spectral integrals
Let E be a spectral measure on the measurable space (X, Σ). For each
Ψ ∈H , the mapping μΨ : Σ →[0, ∞), deﬁned by
μΨ(B) := ⟨Ψ, E(B)Ψ⟩= ∥E(B)Ψ∥2,
B ∈Σ,
is a ﬁnite measure on the measurable space (X, Σ), with
μΨ(B) ≤∥Ψ∥2.
We remark that, for all unit vectors Ψ ∈H (i.e., ∥Ψ∥= 1), μΨ(X) = 1.
Hence, μΨ is a probability measure on (X, Σ).13 Therefore, (X, Σ, μΨ) is a
probability space.14
For a Σ-measurable function f on X, the Lebesgue integral

For each pair (Φ, Ψ) ∈H × H , the mapping μΦ,Ψ : Σ →C deﬁned by
μΦ,Ψ(B) := ⟨Φ, E(B)Ψ⟩,

is a complex-valued measure. Note that
μΦ,Ψ(B) = ⟨E(B)Φ, E(B)Ψ⟩.
Hence, by the Schwarz inequality, we have

Then, (1.38) implies that L is a bounded linear functional on H . Hence,
according to the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique vector
ΘΨ ∈H such that L(Φ) = ⟨ΘΨ, Φ⟩and ∥ΘΨ∥= ∥L∥. It follows that the
correspondence Df ∋Ψ →ΘΨ is linear. Hence, we can deﬁne a linear

valued functional associated with E. As is shown in Theorem 1.19, IE
obeys certain laws. The calculus of IE is called the operational calculus,
or the functional calculus, with respect to E.
The following theorem summarizes basic properties of the operator-
valued functional IE.
Theorem 1.19. Let f, g ∈MΣ(X) and B0 ∈Σ such that E(B0) = 0.
(i) For all B ∈Σ, E(B)IE(f) ⊂IE(f)E(B).
(ii) If E({λ| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0, then D(IE(f)) is dense in H . In
this case, IE(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator and IE(f)∗=
IE(f ∗), where f ∗denotes the complex conjugate of f.
(iii) If f(λ) ∈C, λ ∈X, then IE(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator
and IE(f)∗= IE(f ∗).
(iv) If f is bounded on Bc
0 = X\B0, i.e., Cf := supλ∈Bc
0 |f(λ)| < ∞, then
IE(f) ∈B(H ) and ∥IE(f)∥≤Cf.
(v) If |f(λ)| = 1 for all λ ∈Bc
0, then IE(f) is unitary.
(vi) If f : X →R ∪{±∞} and E({λ ∈X| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0, then
IE(f) is self-adjoint. In particular, if f(λ) ∈R, λ ∈X, then IE(f)
is self-adjoint.
(vii) If there exist a set N0 ∈Σ and a real number γ such that E(N0) = 0
and, for all λ ∈N c
0, γ ≤f(λ) < ∞, then IE(f) is a self-adjoint
operator with IE(f) ≥γ. In particular, if γ ≤f(λ) < ∞, λ ∈X,
then IE(f) is a self-adjoint operator with IE(f) ≥γ.
(viii) IE(f)+IE(g) ⊂IE(f +g). In particular, if g is bounded on Bc
0, then
IE(f) + IE(g) = IE(f + g).
(ix) D(IE(fg)) ∩D(IE(g)) = D(IE(f)IE(g)) and IE(f)IE(g) ⊂IE(fg).
In particular, if g is bounded on Bc
0, then IE(f)IE(g) = IE(fg).
(x) If fn ∈MΣ(X) (n ∈N) with supn∈N,λ∈Bc
0 |fn(λ)| < ∞and
limn→∞fn(λ) = f(λ), λ ∈Bc
0, then IE(fn), IE(f) ∈B(H ) and
s-limn→∞IE(fn) = IE(f).

and call it the essential range of f with respect to the spectral measure
E. It follows that RE(f) is a closed set.

Proof. See, for example, Schm¨udgen (2012), Proposition 4.20.

(i) Suppose that there exists a set N0 ∈Σ such that E(N0) = 0 and

0. Then, IE(f) is injective and IE(f)−1 =
IE(1/f).15 Moreover,
"
IE(f)−1#∗= IE(f ∗)−1.
(ii) Suppose that there exists a set N0 ∈Σ such that E(N0) = 0 and
0 < f(λ) < +∞, λ ∈N c
0. Then, IE(f) is an injective non-negative
self-adjoint operator and IE(f)−1 = IE(1/f).
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈ker IE(f). Then, 0 = ∥IE(f)Ψ∥2 =

X |f(λ)|2 × d
∥E(λ)Ψ∥2. Hence, the present assumption implies that ∥E(X\N0)Ψ∥2 = 0.
Note that E(X\N0) = E(X) −E(N0) = I. Hence, we obtain Ψ = 0.
Therefore, ker IE(f) = {0}. Thus, IE(f) is injective.
By Theorem 1.19(ix), IE(f)IE(1/f) ⊂I. Hence, by Proposition 1.1,
IE(1/f) ⊂IE(f)−1. Let Ψ ∈D(IE(f)−1) and Φ := IE(f)−1Ψ. Then,
Φ ∈D(IE(f)) and Ψ

Hence, Ψ ∈D(IE(1/f)). Therefore, D(IE(f)−1) ⊂D(IE(1/f)). Thus,
IE(1/f) = IE(f)−1.

(ii) The self-adjointness of IE(f) follows from Theorem 1.19(vi). For
all Ψ ∈D(IE(f)), we have ⟨Ψ, IE(f)Ψ⟩=

X f(λ)d ⟨Ψ, E(λ)Ψ⟩. Under the

non-negative. The other properties of IE(f) follow from an application
of (i).

For a d-dimensional spectral measure E and a continuous function f on
Rd, the essential range RE(f) is identiﬁed as follows.
Lemma 1.3. Let E be a d-dimensional spectral measure and f ∈C(Rd).
Then,
RE(f) = f(supp E).
(1.44)
Proof. Let λ0 ∈f(supp E) and let ε > 0. Then, there exists a point x0 ∈
supp E such that |f(x0) −λ0| < ε/2. By the continuity of f, there exists a
constant δ > 0 such that, if |x−x0| < δ, x ∈Rd, then |f(x)−f(x0)| < ε/2.
By the triangle inequality, we have, for all x ∈Rd satisfying |x −x0| < δ,
|f(x) −λ0| ≤|f(x) −f(x0)| + |f(x0) −λ0| < ε.
Hence, Bδ(x0) ⊂Vε := {x ∈Rd| |f(x) −λ0| < ε}. Since x0 is in supp E,
it follows that E(Bδ(x0)) ̸= 0. Hence, E(Vε) ̸= 0. Therefore, λ0 ∈RE(f).
Thus, f(supp E) ⊂RE(f).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, we prove (f(supp E))c ⊂
(RE(f))c. So, let λ0 ∈(f(supp E))c. Then, for all suﬃciently small ε > 0,
{x ∈Rd| |f(x) −λ0| < ε} = ∅. Hence, E({x ∈Rd| |f(x) −λ0| < ε}) = 0.
Therefore, λ0 ∈(RE(f))c.

Theorem 1.21. Let E be a d-dimensional spectral measure and f ∈C(Rd).

where u−1(C) denotes the inverse image of C by u:
u−1(C) := {λ ∈X|u(λ) ∈C} ∈Σ.
Proposition 1.37. The mapping E ◦u−1 is a spectral measure on (Y, ΣY ).
Proof. It is obvious that (E ◦u−1)(Y ) = I. Let Cn ∈ΣY , n ∈N and

measure of S.
In general, a representation of a linear operator A in terms of a spectral

Remark 1.9. A linear operator T on H is said to be normal if T is densely
deﬁned, closed and T ∗T = T T ∗. Obviously, self-adjoint operators and uni-
tary operators are normal. Normal operators also have spectral represen-
tations (see, for example, Yosida, 1965, Chapter XI, Section 3; Yosida and
Ito, 1976, Chapter 2, Section 2.3; Hiai and Yanagi, 1995, Theorem A.5.10;
Arai and Ezawa, 1999a, Section 2.9; and Schm¨udgen, 2012, Section 5.5).
See also Problems 22 and 23.
Example 1.3. Let T be a closed symmetric operator on H with the fol-
lowing properties: (i) σ(T ) = σp(T ) = {En}n∈N (En ̸= Em if n ̸= m);
(ii) H = ⊕∞
n=1 ker(T −En) (note that En ∈R). Then, T is self-adjoint.
Proof. Let dn := dim ker(T −En) ≤∞and {Ψnj}j=1,...,dn be a CONS of
ker(T −En). Then, (ii) implies that {Ψnj|n ∈N, j = 1, . . . , dn} is a CONS of

Hence, Ran(T −i) = H . Similarly, one can show that Ran(T + i) = H .
Therefore, by a basic criterion for self-adjointness of a symmetric operator
(see Proposition 1.28), T is self-adjoint.
□

projection onto the eigenspace ker(T −En). Then, (1.48) is equivalent to

This suggests that the operator ET (·), deﬁned by

may be the spectral measure of T . Here, 
En∈B means the sum over n
such that En ∈B (if {n ∈N|En ∈B} = ∅, then 
En∈B(·) := 0). Indeed,
one can prove that ET (·) is the spectral measure of T (Problem 14).
Example 1.4. Let P ̸= 0, I be an orthogonal projection on a Hilbert space
H . Then, P is a bounded self-adjoint operator and σ(P) = σp(P) = {0, 1}.
It is easy to see that ker(P −1) = RanP and ker P = (RanP)⊥. Hence,
H = ker(P −1) ⊕ker P. The orthogonal projection onto ker(P −1) (resp.,
ker P) is P (resp., I −P). Hence, by (1.49),
EP ({1}) = P,
EP ({0}) = I −P,

EP (B) = 0,

Remark 1.10. In applications to quantum mechanics, the concept of spec-
tral measure of a self-adjoint operator plays an essential role for the probabil-
ity interpretation of quantum mechanics in the following manner. A state17
of a quantum system, i.e., a quantum mechanical state is represented by
a unit vector in a Hilbert space H and a physical quantity (observable)
of the system is represented by a self-adjoint operator on H . A basic fact
in the quantum mechanical world is that a measurement on a quantum
system is not independent of the object to be measured, i.e., a measure-
ment of a quantum mechanical object in a quantum mechanical state may
change the state to another one with some probability, not deterministi-
cally. Quantum mechanics gives a method to calculate such a probability:
for a physical quantity (a quantum mechanical object) represented by a
self-adjoint operator T on H , the probability that the result of a mea-
surement of T in a state Ψ ∈H lies in a Borel set B ⊂R is given by
∥ET (B)Ψ∥2 (recall that ∥ET (·)Ψ∥2 is a probability measure on (R, B1); see
Section 1.5.4(C)), and the expectation value of T in such measurements
is

R λd∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 = ⟨Ψ, T Ψ⟩. This forms a basic part of the probability
interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this way, the spectral measure of
a self-adjoint operator is used to give a mathematical foundation to the
probability interpretation of quantum mechanics in a very general setting
(not limited to speciﬁc quantum systems in which the spectra of physical
quantities consist of only eigenvalues).
An important result can be derived from the interpretation above. Let
Φ ∈H be a unit vector representing a quantum mechanical state and PΦ be
the orthogonal projection onto the one-dimensional subspace {αΦ|α ∈C}
generated by Φ. Then, we have
PΦΨ = ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩Φ,
Ψ ∈H .
(1.52)
By Example 1.4, the spectral measure EPΦ of PΦ is given as follows:
EPΦ({1}) = PΦ,
(1.53)
EPΦ({0}) = I −PΦ,
(1.54)
EPΦ(B) = 0,
B ⊂R\{0, 1}, B ∈B1.
(1.55)
Hence, the probability that the result of a measurement of PΦ in a state Ψ
lies in the set {1} is ∥EPΦ({1})Ψ∥2 = | ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩|2 by (1.53) and (1.52). On the
17We mean by “state” a pure state. There is a more general class of states called “mixed
states,” which can be formed from several states through superposition.
52
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
other hand, a measurement of PΦ in a state Ψ is interpreted as a measure-
ment of whether or not the state Φ is found in Ψ. Hence, ∥EPΦ({1})Ψ∥2 is
interpreted as the probability of ﬁnding Φ in Ψ by a measurement. There-
fore, | ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩|2 is interpreted as the probability of ﬁnding Φ in Ψ by a mea-
surement. Since ﬁnding Φ in Ψ by measurement means the transition from
Ψ to Φ, the quantity | ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩|2 is called the transition probability from
Ψ to Φ, while the inner product ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩is called the transition amplitude
from Ψ to Φ.

Spectral measure and spectra
Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, we ﬁrst note the following
fact.
Theorem 1.23.
σ(S) = supp ES.
(1.56)
Proof. This follows from an application of Theorem 1.21 with d = 1,
E = ES and f(λ) = λ, λ ∈R.
□
Remark 1.11. There is another proof of (1.56) (see Problem 13).
Proposition 1.38. Let λ ∈R. Then, λ ∈σ(S) if and only if, for all ε > 0,
ES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) ̸= 0.
Proof. A
simple
application
of
Theorem
1.20(i),
with
(X, Σ)
=
(R, B1), E = ES and f(λ) = λ, λ ∈R.
□
Proposition 1.39. A real number λ is an eigenvalue of S (i.e., λ ∈σp(S))
if and only if ES({λ}) ̸= 0. In that case, RanES({λ}) = ker(S −λ) and,
for all Ψ ∈ker(S −λ), supp ∥ES(·)Ψ∥2 = {λ}.
Proof. Apply Theorem 1.20(iii), with (X, Σ) = (R, B1), E = ES and
f(λ) = λ, λ ∈R.
□
Proposition 1.40. If λ ∈σ(S) is an isolated point of σ(S), then λ ∈
σp(S).
Proof. We have ES({λ}) + ES(σ(S)\{λ}) = ES(σ(S)) = I (by (1.56)).
Suppose that ES({λ}) = 0. Then, ES(σ(S)\{λ}) = I. By the isolatedness
of λ assumed, σ(S)\{λ} is a closed set. Hence, supp ES ⊂σ(S)\{λ}. But
this contradicts (1.56). Hence, ES({λ}) ̸= 0. Thus, by Proposition 1.39,
λ is an eigenvalue of S.

Essential spectrum
The set
σess(S) := σ(S)\σd(S)
is called the essential spectrum of S, where σd(S) is the discrete spectrum
of S (see Section 1.2.4). Hence, we have
σ(S) = σess(S) ∪σd(S),
σess(S) ∩σd(S) = ∅.
(1.57)
It follows that, if dim H < ∞, then σess(S) = ∅. Hence, the concept
of essential spectrum is meaningful only if the Hilbert space H is inﬁnite
dimensional.
For notational simplicity, we sometimes write RanES(·) := Ran(ES(·)).
Proposition 1.41.
(i) The essential spectrum σess(S) is a closed set in R.
(ii) A real number λ is in σess(S) if and only if, for all ε
>
0,
dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) = ∞.
Proof. (i) Let λn ∈σess(S), n ∈N and limn→∞λn = λ. Suppose that
λ ∈σd(S). Then, σ(S)\{λ} is closed. Note that λn ∈σ(S)\{λ}. Hence,
λ ∈σ(S)\{λ}. But this is a contradiction. Hence, λ ∈σess(S). Thus, σess(S)
is closed.
(ii) “only if” part: Let λ ∈σess(S). Then, the following two cases (a)
and (b) should be considered:
(a) The case where λ is an eigenvalue of S;
(b) The case where λ is not an eigenvalue of S.
The case (a): In this case, the eigenvalue λ is non-isolated or has inﬁ-
nite multiplicity. Suppose that λ is a non-isolated eigenvalue of S ﬁrst.
Then, there exists a sequence {λn}∞
n=1 (λn ̸= λm, n ̸= m) such that
λn ∈σ(S)\{λ}, n ≥1, and limn→∞λn = λ. For each n, there exists an
εn > 0 such that (λn −εn, λn + εn) ∩(λm −εm, λm + εm) = ∅, for n ̸= m.
By Proposition 1.38, dim RanES((λn −εn, λn + εn)) ≥1. For any ε > 0,
there exists an n0 ∈N such that (λ −ε, λ + ε) ⊃∪n≥n0(λn −εn, λn + εn).
Hence, by Proposition 1.27,
dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) ≥
∞

n=n0
dim RanES((λn −εn, λn + εn)) = ∞.

Mapping f(·).
We next consider the case where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ is
inﬁnite. In this case, for all ε > 0,
dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) ≥dim RanES({λ}) = ∞.
The case (b): In this case, λ is not an isolated point of σ(S) by Proposition
1.40. Then, in the same way as in the proof of the ﬁrst case of (a), we can
show that dim RanES((λ −ε, λ + ε)) = ∞.
“if ” part: Suppose that λ ∈σd(S). Then, λ is an isolated point in σ(S)
and the multiplicity m of λ is ﬁnite. Hence, there exists a constant δ > 0
such that (λ −δ, λ + δ) ∩σ(S) = {λ} and dim RanES({λ}) = m. Hence,
dim RanES((λ −δ, λ + δ)) = dim RanES({λ}) < ∞.

1.5.9
Functional calculus
Since the spectral measure ES of the self-adjoint operator S is a one-
dimensional spectral measure, one can apply the general theory of the func-
tional calculus with respect to a spectral measure, as described in Section
1.5.4, to deﬁne an operator-valued functional on MB1(R) (the set of Borel
measurable functions on R):
IES(f) =

R
f(λ)dES(λ),
f ∈MB1(R).
In what follows, we write IES(f) = f(S), i.e.,
f(S) :=

R
f(λ)dES(λ),
f ∈MB1(R).
(1.58)
Note that, for each f ∈MB1(R), the correspondence : S →f(S) gives an
operator-valued function on the set S(H ) of self-adjoint operators on H
(Fig. 1.5). We call the calculus on the operators {f(S)|f ∈MB1(R)} the
functional calculus for the self-adjoint operator S.
Theorem 1.19 implies the following:
Theorem 1.24. Let f and g be Borel measurable functions on R.
(i) For all B ∈B1, ES(B)f(S) ⊂f(S)ES(B).
(ii) If ES({λ ∈R| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0, then f(S) is a densely deﬁned
closed operator and f(S)∗= f ∗(S).
Theory of Linear Operators
55
(iii) If f(λ) ∈C, λ ∈R, then f(S) is a densely deﬁned closed operator
and f(S)∗= f ∗(S).
(iv) If f is bounded on supp ES, i.e., Kf := supλ∈supp ES |f(λ)| < ∞,
then f(S) ∈B(H ) and ∥f(S)∥≤Kf.
(v) If |f(λ)| = 1 for all λ ∈supp ES, then f(S) is unitary.
(vi) If f : R →R ∪{±∞} and ES({λ ∈R| |f(λ)| = +∞}) = 0, then
f(S) is self-adjoint. In particular, if f(λ) ∈R, λ ∈R, then f(S) is
self-adjoint.
(vii) If there exists a real number γ such that, for all λ ∈R, γ ≤f(λ) < ∞,
then f(S) is a self-adjoint operator with f(S) ≥γ. In particular,
if 0 ≤f(λ) < ∞, λ ∈R, then f(S) is a non-negative self-adjoint
operator.
(viii) f(S) + g(S) ⊂(f + g)(S). In particular, if g is bounded on supp ES,
then f(S) + g(S) = (f + g)(S).
(ix) D((fg)(S)) ∩D(g(S)) = D(f(S)g(S)) and f(S)g(S) ⊂(fg)(S). In
particular, if g is bounded on supp ES, then f(S)g(S) = (fg)(S).
(x) If fn ∈MB1(R), n ∈N satisfy supn∈N,λ∈supp ES |fn(λ)| < ∞and
limn→∞fn(λ) = f(λ), λ ∈supp ES, then fn(S), f(S) ∈B(H ) and
s- limn→∞fn(S) = f(S).
Example 1.5. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . In Theorem 1.16,
we have seen that, for all n ∈N, T n is self-adjoint. If T is non-negative,
then one can use functional calculus for T to deﬁne the fractional power T α
for α > 0 in the following manner. We deﬁne a function fα on R as follows:
fα(λ) :=

λα,
λ > 0
0,
λ ≤0
.
Then, fα is continuous on R and non-negative. Hence, according to Theorem
1.24(vii), fα(T ) is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H . It is easy to
see that, for all n ∈N, fn(T ) = T n. For α ̸∈N, α > 0, we deﬁne T α by
T α := fα(T ).
By Theorem 1.24(vii), T α is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H .
With regard to the spectrum of f(S), we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1.25 (Spectral mapping theorem). If f is continuous on R,
then
σ(f(S)) = {f(λ)|λ ∈σ(S)}.
(1.59)
56
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. This follows from Theorem 1.21 and (1.56).
□
Concerning the point spectrum of f(S), we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1.26. Let f : R →C be a Borel measurable function such that,
for all λ ∈R, |f(λ)| < ∞.
(i) Suppose that S has an eigenvalue λ0 ∈R. Then, for all Ψ ∈ker(S−λ0),
f(S)Ψ = f(λ0)Ψ.
(1.60)
Namely, f(λ0) is an eigenvalue of f(S) and ker(S −λ0) ⊂ker(f(S) −
f(λ0)).
(ii) Suppose that f is injective. Then,
σp(f(S)) = {f(λ)|λ ∈σp(S)}.
(1.61)
Proof. (i) By the spectral representation with respect to ES, we have
∥f(S)Ψ −f(λ0)Ψ∥2 =

R
|f(λ) −f(λ0)|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
By Proposition 1.39, supp ∥ES(·)Ψ∥2 = {λ0}. Hence, the right-hand side of
the above equation is zero. Therefore, ∥f(S)Ψ −f(λ0)Ψ∥2 = 0. Thus, (1.60)
holds.
(ii) Part (i) implies that σp(f(S)) ⊃{f(λ)|λ ∈σp(S)}. To prove the
converse inclusion relation, let a ∈σp(f(S)) so that f(S)Ψ = aΨ, for all
Ψ ∈ker(f(S) −a). Hence,

R |f(λ) −a|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 = 0. Hence, there
exists a Borel set N0 such that ∥ES(N0)Ψ∥2 = 0 and, for all λ ∈N c
0,
f(λ) = a. Since f is injective, it follows that N c
0 = {λ0} with λ0 := f −1(a).
Then, ∥(S −λ0)Ψ∥2 =

{λ0} |λ −λ0|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 = 0. Hence, SΨ = λ0Ψ.
Therefore, f −1(a) ∈σp(S), i.e., a ∈f(σp(S)). Thus, σp(f(S)) ⊂{f(λ)|λ ∈
σp(S)}.
□
Corollary 1.3 takes the following form in terms of f(S).
Corollary 1.4. Let f be a Borel measurable function on R such that
|f(λ)| > 0, λ ∈R. Then:
(i) The operator f(S) is injective and f(S)−1
=
1
f (S). Moreover,
(f(S)−1)∗= (f ∗(S))−1.
(ii) If f(λ) > 0, λ ∈R. then f(S) is an injective non-negative self-adjoint
operator and f(S)−1 = 1
f (S).

Theorem 1.27. Let f be a real-valued Borel measurable function on R
(f(λ) ∈R, λ ∈R). Then, ES ◦f −1 is the spectral measure of the self-

Proof. For all Ψ ∈H and Φ ∈D(f(S)), we have
⟨Ψ, f(S)Φ⟩=

The spectral measure of a multiplication operator
We consider the multiplication operator MF on L2(X, dμ) in Section 1.5.3
in the case where F(x) ∈R, for μ-a.e. x ∈X. Then, by Theorem 1.18(ii),
MF is self-adjoint. In view of the spectral theorem, it is natural to ask what
form the spectral measure EMF of MF does take.
It is easy to see that, for all B ∈B1, the operator
PF (B) := MχF −1(B),
the multiplication operator by the function χF −1(B), is an orthogonal
projection on L2(X, dμ), and the mapping PF : B1 ∋B →PF (B) ∈
P(L2(X, dμ)) is a one-dimensional spectral measure.
We recall a well-known lemma.
Lemma 1.4. Let ν be a complex-valued measure on (X, Σ) and
νF (B) := ν(F −1(B)),
B ∈B1.
Then, νF is a complex-valued measure on (R, B1). Moreover, for all Borel
measurable functions f : R →C ∪{±∞},

X
f(F(x))dν(x) =

f(λ)dνF (λ),
provided that one of the integrals exists.
On the spectral measure EMF of MF , we have the following.

E ∈Σ.
Then, ν is a complex-valued measure on (X, Σ) and

Strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups
Let S be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H as before. For each
t ∈R, we deﬁne ft : R →C by ft(λ) := eitλ, λ ∈R. Obviously, |ft(λ)| = 1.
Hence, by Theorem 1.24(v), ft(S) is a unitary operator. This unitary oper-
ator is usually written as eitS:
eitS :=

R
eitλdES(λ).
To state the basic properties of this operator, we recall the basic notions
on vector-valued functions.
Deﬁnition 1.1. Let I be an interval in R.
(i) Let F
: I →B(H ) be a mapping from I to B(H ) (F(t) ∈
B(H ), t ∈I). Then, F is said to be strongly continuous at t0 ∈I
if s- limt→t0 F(t) = F(t0) (s- lim denotes the strong limit; see Section
1.3.3), i.e., for all Ψ ∈H , limt→t0 F(t)Ψ = F(t0)Ψ. If F is strongly
continuous at all t ∈I, then F is said to be strongly continuous on I.
(ii) Let Φ : I →H ; I ∋t →Φ(t) ∈H (an H -valued function on I).
Then, Φ is said to be strongly diﬀerentiable at t0 ∈I if
Φ′(t0) := lim
t→t0
1
t −t0
[Φ(t) −Φ(t0)] ∈H
exists. If Φ is strongly diﬀerentiable at all t ∈I, then Φ is strongly
diﬀerentiable on I. In this case, the mapping Φ′ : I →H ;I ∋t →
Theory of Linear Operators
59
Φ′(t) ∈H is called the strong derivative of Φ. We also use the
following symbols:
Φ′(t) = dΦ(t)
dt
= d
dtΦ(t).
(iii) Let F : I →L(H ); I ∋t →F(t) ∈L(H ), an operator-valued function
on I with values in L(H ). If there exists a subspace D ⊂H such that
D ⊂∩t∈ID(F(t)) and, for all Ψ ∈D, the H -valued function F(·)Ψ
is strongly diﬀerentiable on I, then F(·) ↾D is said to be strongly
diﬀerentiable on I. In this case, the operator F ′
s(t) with D(F ′
s(t)) :=
D (t ∈I), deﬁned by
F ′
s(t)Ψ := d
dtF(t)Ψ,
is called the strong derivative of F(·) ↾D. We also write
F ′
s(t) = s- d
dtF(t) = s-dF(t)
dt
.
Remark 1.12. The deﬁnition of the strong continuity also applies to the
case where I is replaced by an open subset of a complete metric space (e.g.,
an open subset of Rn or Cn (n ∈N)).
Theorem 1.29.
(i) (group property) ei0S = I, ei(t+s)S = eitSeisS = eisSeitS, s, t ∈R.
(ii) (strong continuity) The mapping R ∋t →eitS is strongly continuous
on R.

t →eitSΨ is strongly diﬀerentiable on R, and its strong derivative is
given as follows:

example, Reed and Simon, 1972, Theorem VIII.7, and Arai, 1997a, 2014b,
Theorem 4.4). We give a proof only for (v).
(v) Let M be the set on the left-hand side of (1.63). Let Ψ ∈M . Then,
for all t ∈R, eitSΨ = Ψ. Hence, for t ̸= 0, (1/t)(eitS −1)Ψ = 0. Hence,
limt→0(1/t)(eitS −1)Ψ = 0. Hence, by part (iv), Ψ ∈D(S) and then, by
part (iii), SΨ = 0. Therefore, Ψ ∈ker S. Thus, M ⊂ker S.
Conversely, let Ψ ∈ker S. Then, Ψ ∈D(S) and SΨ = 0. Hence, by
Theorem 1.26 (i), eitSΨ = eit·0Ψ = Ψ, for all t ∈R. Hence, Ψ ∈M .
Therefore, ker S ⊂M . Thus, (1.63) holds.
□
The family {eitS}t∈R is a realization of a general concept deﬁned as
follows.
A family of unitary operators {U(t)}t∈R on a Hilbert space H is called
a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group if it has the
following properties:
(U.1) (group property) U(t + s) = U(t)U(s), t, s ∈R (then it follows that
U(0) = I and U(t)U(s) = U(s)U(t), t, s ∈R);
(U.2) (strong continuity) s- lims→0 U(t + s) = U(t), t ∈R.
For this object, the following important theorem holds.18
Theorem 1.30 (Stone’s theorem). For each strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group {U(t)}t∈R, there exists a unique self-adjoint
operator S such that U(t) = eitS, t ∈R.
The self-adjoint operator S in this theorem is called the inﬁnitesimal
generator, or generator, of {U(t)}t∈R. Thus, there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between a self-adjoint operator and a strongly continuous
one-parameter unitary group. The family {eitS}t∈R is called the strongly
continuous one-parameter unitary group generated by S.
The following theorem is sometimes useful to prove the essential self-
adjointness of a given symmetric operator.
Theorem 1.31. Let {U(t)}t∈R be a strongly continuous one-parameter uni-
tary group on a Hilbert space H and T be a symmetric operator on H .
18For a proof of this theorem and related topics, we refer the reader to textbooks on the
Hilbert space theory, for example, Reed and Simon (1972), Theorem VIII.8, and Arai
(2014b), Theorem 4.6.

t (U(t)Ψ −Ψ).
Then, T is essentially self-adjoint, and U(t) = eitT , t ∈R.
Proof. Let Φ ∈ker(T ∗+ i), Ψ ∈D and deﬁne f : R →C by f(t) :=
⟨Φ, U(t)Ψ⟩, t ∈R. Then, f is diﬀerentiable with f ′(t) = ⟨Φ, iT U(t)Ψ⟩
= i⟨T ∗Φ, U(t)Ψ⟩= −f(t). Hence, f(t) = ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩e−t. Hence, | ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩| =
|f(t)|et ≤∥Φ∥∥Ψ∥et. Letting t →−∞, we obtain ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩= 0. Since D is
dense, it follows that Φ = 0. Hence, ker(T ∗+ i) = {0}. Similarly, one can
show that ker(T ∗−i) = {0}. Thus, T is essentially self-adjoint.

Theory of Linear Operators

In general, for a linear operator A on a Hilbert space, the subspace
C∞(A) := ∩∞
n=1D(An)
(1.68)
is an invariant subspace of A, i.e., AC∞(A) ⊂C∞(A). The subspace C∞(A)
is called the C∞-domain of A. An element in C∞(A) is called a C∞-vector
for A.
If A is a self-adjoint operator on H , then one can also deﬁne
C∞
0 (A) := ∪∞
n=1RanEA([−n, n]).
(1.69)
We call it the C∞
0 -domain for A.
Lemma 1.5. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then:
(i) C∞
0 (S) ⊂C∞(S).
(ii) C∞
0 (S) is dense in H .
(iii) C∞(S) is dense in H .
(iv) For all f ∈C(R), C∞
0 (S) is a core for f(S).
(v) Let S ≥0. Then, for all α > 0, C∞
0 (S) is a core for Sα (see
Example 1.5).
Proof. (i) Let Ψ
∈
C∞
0 (S). Then, there is an n
∈
N such that
ES([−n, n])Ψ = Ψ. Hence, for all k ∈N,

R
|λ|2kd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 =

|λ|≤n
|λ|2kd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 ≤n2k∥Ψ∥2 < ∞.
Therefore, Ψ ∈D(Sk). Thus, Ψ ∈C∞(S).
(ii) By (1.36), for all Ψ ∈H , limn→∞ES([−n, n])Ψ = Ψ. Hence C∞
0 (S)
is dense in H .
(iii) This follows from (i) and (ii).
(iv) Let Ψ ∈D(f(S)) and Ψn := ES([−n, n])Ψ (n ∈N). Then, Ψn ∈
C∞
0 (S) and Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). Moreover,
∥f(S)Ψn −f(S)Ψ∥2 =

|λ|>n
|f(λ)|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
By applying the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, the integral on
the right-hand side converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence, f(S)Ψn →f(S)Ψ
(n →∞). Thus, C∞
0 (S) is a core for f(S).
(v) This follows from Example 1.5 and (iv).

Proposition 1.42. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H and k, ℓ∈N
with ℓ> k. Then:

∥SkΨ∥2 ≤ε∥SℓΨ∥2 +

In particular, for any η > 0,

Ψ ∈D(Sℓ).
(1.71)
(ii) D(Sℓ) is a core of Sk.
(iii) Every core of Sℓis a core of Sk.
Proof. (i) By the deﬁnition of the domain of the product of linear opera-
tors, D(Sℓ) ⊂D(Sk). Let Ψ ∈D(Sℓ) and R > 0. Then,

Putting ε = 1/R2(ℓ−k), we obtain (1.70). Inequality (1.71) follows from
taking the square root of (1.70) and letting η = √ε.
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(Sk) and Ψn := ES([−n, n])Ψ (n ∈N). Then,

R
λ2ℓd∥ES(λ)Ψn∥2 =

[−n,n]
λ2ℓd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 ≤n2ℓ∥Ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence, Ψn ∈D(Sℓ). Moreover, Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). We have
∥SkΨn −SkΨ∥2 =

|λ|>n
λ2kd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
Since 
R λ2kd∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞, the right-hand side on the above equation
converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence, SkΨn →SkΨ (n →∞). This means that
D(Sℓ) is a core of Sk.
(iii) This follows from an application of Proposition 1.16.

Inequality (1.71) means that, for 0 < k < ℓ(k, ℓ∈N), Sk is inﬁnitesi-
mally small with respect to Sℓ.
An extension of Proposition 1.42 to the case where ℓand k are replaced
by positive real numbers is given as follows.
Proposition 1.43. Let S be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H
and α, β be positive real numbers satisfying 0 < α < β. Then, the following
(i)–(iii) hold:
(i) D(Sβ) ⊂D(Sα) and, for any ε > 0,
∥SαΨ∥2 ≤ε∥SβΨ∥2 +
1
εα/(β−α) ∥Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈D(Sβ).
In particular, for any η > 0,
∥SαΨ∥≤η∥SβΨ∥+
1
ηα/(β−α) ∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(Sβ).
(1.72)
(ii) D(Sβ) is a core of Sα.
(iii) Every core of Sβ is a core of Sα.
Proof. This proposition can be proved in a way parallel to the proof of
Proposition 1.42. Therefore, to give the details of the proof is left to the
reader (Problem 15).
□
Inequality (1.72) means that, for 0 < α < β, Sα is inﬁnitesimally small
with respect to Sβ.
Proposition 1.44. Let S be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H .
Then,
∥S1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥Ψ∥2 = ∥(S + 1)1/2Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈D(S1/2).
(1.73)
Proof. This follows from simple functional calculus using the spectral rep-

[0,∞)(λ + c)1/2dES(λ) (c ≥0), where ES is the
spectral measure of S.19

Proposition 1.45. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H .
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(S),
∥eiSΨ −Ψ∥≤∥SΨ∥.

19Another proof is as follows: (i) one proves (1.73) on D(S) (this is easy); (ii) using
the fact that D(S) is a core of D(S1/2) (Proposition 1.43(ii)), one extends by a limiting
argument the equality obtained in (i) to all Ψ ∈D(S1/2).
66
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. By the functional calculus for S, we have
∥eiSΨ −Ψ∥2 =

R
|eiλ −1|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2.
It is easy to see that |eiλ −1| ≤|λ|, λ ∈R. Hence,
∥eiSΨ −Ψ∥2 ≤

R
|λ|2d∥ES(λ)Ψ∥2 = ∥SΨ∥2.
Thus, (1.74) follows.
□
The following theorem also is an important general fact in the theory
of self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 1.34. Let H0 and H be non-negative self-adjoint operators on a
Hilbert space H such that D(H) ⊂D(H0) and
∥H0Ψ∥≤a∥HΨ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H),
(1.75)
where a, b ≥0 are constants. Then, D(H1/2) ⊂D(H1/2
0
) and, for any ε > 0,
there exists a constant cε ≥0 such that
∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥≤
√
a + ε∥H1/2Ψ∥+ cε∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H1/2).
(1.76)
Proof. Let t > 0 be such that ta < 1. Then, by (1.75), −tH0 is H-bounded
with a relative bound less than 1. Hence, according to the Kato–Rellich
theorem (Theorem 1.17), H −tH0 is self-adjoint and bounded from below.
Hence, there exists a constant γt ≥0 such that H−tH0 ≥−γt. This implies
that
t∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥2 ≤∥H1/2Ψ∥2 + γt∥Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈D(H).
Since D(H) is a core of H1/2 by Proposition 1.43(ii), it follows from a
limiting argument that this inequality extends to all Ψ ∈D(H1/2), implying
that D(H1/2) ⊂D(H1/2
0
) at the same time. For any ε > 0, we take t =
1/(a + ε) and set cε :=
(
γt/t. Then, we obtain (1.76).

Operators of Exponential Type
Let H be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then,
for each z ∈C, one can deﬁne a linear operator of exponential type:
e−zH :=

R
e−zλdEH(λ),
where EH denotes the spectral measure of H. To be precise, we have
D(e−zH) =

Ψ ∈H



|e−zλ|2d∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞



Φ, e−zHΨ

=

R
e−zλd ⟨Φ, EH(λ)Ψ⟩, Φ ∈H , Ψ ∈D(e−zH).
With regard to the operator e−zH, there are two important cases in
connection with quantum physics, namely, the cases z = it with t ∈R and
z = β with β > 0. According to Theorem 1.24(v), the former case gives
the unitary operator e−itH. If H denotes the Hamiltonian (the total energy
operator) of a quantum system and t is the time parameter, then e−itH/ℏ
describes the time development of state vectors of the quantum system,
where ℏ> 0 is a parameter denoting the reduced Planck constant (Dirac
constant).20
Since the function : R ∋λ →e−βλ (β > 0) is a strictly positive contin-
uous function on R, it follows from Corollary 1.3 that e−βH is an injective
and non-negative self-adjoint operator. But it is not necessarily bounded.
Indeed, the following proposition holds.
Proposition 1.46. Let H be a self-adjoint operator on H .
(i) If H is not bounded from below, then, for all β >, e−βH is unbounded.
(ii) If H is not semi-bounded, then, for all t ∈R\{0}, etH is unbounded.
Proof. (i) Since H is not bounded from below, for each n ∈N, there exists
a number Rn > n such that EH([−Rn, −n]) ̸= 0. Hence, there exists a unit
vector Ψn ∈RanEH([−Rn, −n]). Then,

R
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψn∥2 =

[−Rn,−n]
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψn∥2 ≤e2βRn < ∞.
Hence, Ψn ∈D(e−βH). The equation above also implies that
∥e−βHΨn∥2 =

R
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψn∥2 ≥e2βn →∞(n →∞).
Hence, e−βH is unbounded.
20ℏ=
h
2π (where h is the Planck constant).
68
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) By (i), etH is unbounded for all t < 0. Let t > 0. Then, we write
etH = e−t(−H). Based on the present assumption, −H is not bounded
from below. Hence, by (i) again, e−t(−H) is unbounded. Thus, etH is
unbounded.
□
As is shown in the following lemma, if H is bounded from below, then
e−βH is bounded for all β ≥0. In this case, if H denotes the Hamiltonian
of a quantum system and β > 0 is the inverse temperature parameter,
then Tr e−βH, the trace of e−βH, gives the partition function of the
quantum system in a thermal equilibrium, provided that e−βH is a trace
class operator.
Let
C+ := {z ∈C | Re z ≥0}.
(1.77)
Lemma 1.6. Suppose that H is bounded from below.
(i) For all β ≥0, e−βH is a bounded, injective and non-negative self-
adjoint operator, and
∥e−βH∥= e−βE0(H),
(1.78)
where
E0(H) := inf σ(H).
(ii) For all z ∈C+, e−zH is bounded and
∥e−zH∥= e−(Re z)E0(H).
(1.79)
(iii) (strong continuity) The operator-valued function: z →e−zH is strongly
continuous on C+.
(iv) (semi-group property) For all z, z′ ∈C+, z + z′ ∈C+ and
e−(z+z′)H = e−zHe−z′H = e−z′He−zH.
(1.80)
(v) For all Ψ ∈D(H), the H -valued function z →Ψ(z) := e−zHΨ is
analytic in {z ∈C | Re z > 0} and continuous on C+. Moreover, it
satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
dΨ(z)
dz
= −HΨ(z),
(1.81)
where the derivative is taken in the strong sense.
Theory of Linear Operators
69
Proof. (i) We need only to prove the boundedness of e−βH and (1.78). We
set c := E0(H). One has supp EH = σ(H) ⊂[c, ∞). Hence, for any Ψ ∈H ,

R
|e−βλ|2d∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2 =

[c,∞)
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2 ≤e−2βc∥Ψ∥2 < ∞.
This implies that D(e−βH) = H and ∥e−βHΨ∥≤e−βc∥Ψ∥. Hence, e−βH is
bounded, with ∥e−βH∥≤e−βc. Since c ∈σ(H), it follows from Proposition
1.38 that, for any ε > 0, EH([c, c+ε)) ̸= 0. Hence, there exists a unit vector
Ψε ∈Ran EH([c, c + ε)). Hence,
∥e−βHΨε∥2 =

[c,c+ε)
e−2βλd∥EH(λ)Ψε∥2 ≥e−2β(c+ε).
This implies that e−β(c+ε) ≤∥e−βH∥. Taking the limit ε →0, we obtain
e−βc ≤∥e−βH∥. Thus, (1.78) holds.
(ii) Let z = β + it ∈C+ (β ≥0, t ∈R). Then, through a simple
application of Theorem 1.24(viii),
e−zH = e−βHe−itH.
(1.82)
Since e−itH is unitary, it follows from (i) that e−zH is bounded and
∥e−zH∥= ∥e−βH∥= e−βE0(H).
(iii) By (1.82) and the strong continuity of e−itH in t ∈R, it is suﬃcient
to show that e−βH is strongly continuous in β ≥0. Let Ψ ∈H . Then, for
all β ≥0 and ε ∈(0, δ) (where δ > 0 is a constant),
∥e−(β+ε)HΨ −e−βHΨ∥2 =

[c,∞)
e−2βλ|e−ελ −1|2d∥EH(λ)Ψ∥2.
We have limε→0 e−2βλ|e−ελ −1|2 = 0, for all λ ≥c, and
|e−ελ −1|2 = |e−ε(λ−c)e−εc −1|2 ≤(e|c|δ + 1)2, λ ≥c.
Hence, according to the dominated convergence theorem, we see that
lim
ε→0 ∥e−(β+ε)HΨ −e−βHΨ∥2 = 0.
Hence, e−βH is right continuous in β ≥0. Similarly, one can show that e−βH
is left continuous in β > 0 (note that, for 0 < ε < β, e−(β−ε)H −e−βH =
e−(β−ε)H(1 −e−εH)).
(iv) This follows from a simple application of Theorem 1.24(viii).

can show that
s-

h
Ψ = −HΨ.
(1.83)
Let z ∈C, with Re z > 0 ﬁxed arbitrarily and h ∈C, h ̸= 0 such that
Re (z + h) > 0. Then, it is easy to see that Ψ(z) ∈D(H). By (iv), we have

Using these expressions and (1.83) as well as (iii), we see that
lim
h→0
Ψ(z + h) −Ψ(z)
h
= −HΨ(z).
Hence, Ψ(z) is analytic in {z ∈C | Re z > 0} and (1.81) holds.

Lemma 1.6 shows that, if H is bounded from below, then {e−βH}β≥0
is a strongly continuous one-parameter semi-group on H .21 In the context
of mathematical theory of quantum physics, this semi-group is called the
heat semi-group generated by H. In this case, H is called the generator
of the heat semi-group. This nomenclature may come from (1.81), which
is called the abstract heat equation in the complex variable.22

Analytic Vectors
Let A be a linear operator on a Hilbert space H and C∞(A) be the C∞-
domain of A (see (1.68)). A C∞-vector Ψ ∈C∞(A) is called an analytic
21In general, a family {T(t)}t≥0 of bounded linear operators on a Banach space is
called a C0-semi-group, or a strongly continuous one-parameter semi-group,
if the following three conditions are satisﬁed: (i) (semi-group property) T(t + s) =
T(t)T(s), t, s ≥0; (ii) T(0) = I; (iii) the mapping t →T(t) is strongly continuous.
For the theory of C0-semi-groups, see, for example, Yosida (1965), Chapter IX; Reed
and Simon (1975), Section X.8; and Lax (2002), Chapter 34.
22An original heat equation in the context of physical heat theory is given in the case
where H = −γΔ, where γ > 0 is a constant, Δ is the three-dimensional Laplacian
and, for each β > 0, Ψ(β) is a function on R3 = {x = (x1, x2, x3)|xj ∈R, j = 1, 2, 3}:
∂Ψ(β, x)/∂β = γΔΨ(β, x), where Ψ(β, x) := [Ψ(β)](x) (the value of the function Ψ(β)

(v) The operator ezS is injective and e−zS ⊂(ezS)−1.
Proof. (i) For each Ψ ∈C∞
0 (S), there exists an M ∈N such that

Strong commutativity
Let S and T be linear operators on a Hilbert space H . In the case where
S or T is unbounded, the usual notion of commutativity is not so useful

However, if S and T are self-adjoint, then one can deﬁne another notion of
their commutativity, as follows.

Deﬁnition 1.2. (i) Two self-adjoint operators S and T on a Hilbert space
H are said to strongly commute, or to be strongly commuting, if the
spectral measures ES and ET commute, i.e., for all Borel sets B, C ∈B1,
[ES(B), ET (C)] = 0.
(ii) An N-tuple (T1, . . . , TN) of self-adjoint operators T1, . . . , TN on H
is said to be strongly commuting if, for every pair (i, j) with i ̸= j
(i, j = 1, . . . , N), Ti and Tj strongly commute.
Proposition 1.47. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H . Then, the
following are equivalent:
(i) S and T strongly commute.
(ii) For all B ∈B1, ES(B)T ⊂T ES(B).
(iii) For all z ∈ρ(T ) and B ∈B1, [(T −z)−1, ES(B)] = 0.
Proof. (i) =⇒(ii). Assume (i). Then, for all Ψ ∈H and B, C ∈B1,
∥ET (C)ES(B)Ψ∥= ∥ES(B)ET (C)Ψ∥≤∥ET (C)Ψ∥. Hence, for all Ψ ∈
D(T ),

R
λ2d∥ET (λ)ES(B)Ψ∥2 ≤

R
λ2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence, ES(B)Ψ ∈D(T ). Thus, D(ES(B)T ) ⊂D(T ES(B)). Moreover, for
all Φ ∈H ,
⟨Φ, ES(B)T Ψ⟩=

R
λd ⟨ES(B)Φ, ET (λ)Ψ⟩
=

R
λd ⟨Φ, ET (λ)ES(B)Ψ⟩
= ⟨Φ, T ES(B)Ψ⟩.
Hence, ES(B)T Ψ = T ES(B)Ψ. Thus, (ii) holds.
(ii) =⇒(iii). Assume (ii). Then, for all z ∈C, ES(B)(T −z) ⊂(T −z)
ES(B). Hence, by Proposition 1.1, for all z ∈ρ(T ), (T −z)−1ES(B) ⊂
ES(B)(T −z)−1. Hence, (iii) holds.
(iii) =⇒(i). Assume (iii). Using Stone’s formula (1.65), one can show
that, for all ﬁnite intervals J and B ∈B1, ET (J)ES(B) = ES(B)ET (J).
Then, ﬁxing Ψ, Φ ∈H , B ∈B1 arbitrarily and applying Hopf’s extension
theorem to the complex-valued measures μ1(C) := ⟨Φ, ET (C)ES(B)Ψ⟩and
μ2(C) := ⟨Φ, ES(B)ET (C)Ψ⟩, C ∈B1, one sees that μ1(C) = μ2(C),
C ∈B1. Hence, one obtains ET (C)ES(B) = ES(B)ET (C), B, C ∈B1.
Thus, S and T strongly commute.

Proposition 1.48. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H . Then, the
following are equivalent:
(i) S and T strongly commute.
(ii) For all s ∈R, eisST = T eisS.
(iii) For all s, t ∈R, [eisS, eitT ] = 0.
(iv) For all z ∈ρ(T ) and w ∈ρ(S), [(T −z)−1, (S −w)−1] = 0.
(v) For some z0 ∈ρ(T ) and some w0 ∈ρ(S), [(T −z0)−1, (S −w0)−1] = 0.
Proof. (i) =⇒(ii). Assume (i). Then, Proposition 1.47(ii) holds. This
implies that, for all s ∈R, eisST ⊂T eisS. Hence, eisST e−isS ⊂T . Since
both sides are self-adjoint, it follows that eisST e−isS = T . Hence, (ii) holds.
(ii) =⇒(iii). Assume (ii). Then, eisST e−isS = T , for all s ∈R. By
applying Theorem 1.32 with U = eisS and f(λ) = eitλ, λ ∈R, we obtain
eisSeitT e−isS = eitT . Hence, (iii) holds.
(iii) =⇒(iv). Assume (iii). According to Theorem 1.14, each z ∈C\R is
in ρ(T ). Moreover, it is not so diﬃcult to show that the following formula
holds:
(T −z)−1 =

,
where the integral is taken in the strong sense. It follows that, for all z, w ∈
C\R, (T −z)−1(S −w)−1 = (S −w)−1(T −z)−1 · · · (∗). By the continuity
of the function ρ(T ) ∋z →(T −z)−1 ∈B(H ), one can extend (∗) for all
z ∈ρ(T ) and w ∈ρ(S).
(iv) =⇒(i). This can proved by using Stone’s formula (1.65).
(iv) =⇒(v). This is obvious.
(v) =⇒(iv). For all z ∈C with |z −z0| < 1/∥(T −z0)−1∥, z is in
ρ(T ) and (T −z)−1 = ∞
n=0(z −z0)n(T −z0)−(n+1). Hence, it follows that
(T −z)−1(S −w0)−1 = (S −w0)−1(T −z)−1. According to the theorem
of identity in complex analysis, we obtain that (T −z)−1(S −w0)−1 =
(S −w0)−1(T −z)−1, for all z ∈ρ(T ). In a similar way, for each z ∈ρ(T ),
one can extend the relation to (T −z)−1(S −w)−1 = (S −w)−1(T −z)−1,
for all w ∈ρ(S).

Theorem 1.36. Let S and T be strongly commuting self-adjoint operators
on H and f, g be Borel measurable functions on R. Then:
(i) If f and g are bounded on σ(S) and σ(T ), respectively, then f(S) and
g(T ) are commuting bounded linear operators on H : f(S), g(T ) ∈
B(H ) and f(S)g(T ) = g(T )f(S).
(ii) If f and g are real-valued, then the self-adjoint operators f(S) and
g(T ) strongly commute.
(iii) For all m, n ∈N, Sm and T n strongly commute.
Proof. (i) The boundedness of f(S) and g(T ) follows from Theorem
1.24(iv). It follows from the functional calculus for S and T that, for all
B ∈B1, ES(B)g(T ) = g(T )ES(B). This implies that, for all Ψ, Φ ∈H ,
⟨Φ, f(S)g(T )Ψ⟩=

R
f(λ)d ⟨Φ, ES(λ)g(T )Ψ⟩=

R
f(λ)d ⟨g(T )∗Φ, ES(λ)Ψ⟩
= ⟨g(T )∗Φ, f(S)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, g(T )f(S)Ψ⟩.
Hence, f(S)g(T ) = g(T )f(S).
(ii) According to Theorem 1.27, we have Ef(S)(B) = ES(f −1(B)),
B ∈B1 and Eg(T )(C) = ET (g−1(C)), C ∈B1. Hence, Ef(S) and Eg(T )
commute. Therefore, f(S) and g(T ) strongly commute.
(iii) We need only to apply part (ii) to the case where f(λ) = λm and
g(λ) = λn, λ ∈R.
□
The following proposition tells us that the notion of strong commutativ-
ity of self-adjoint operators is indeed stronger than that of commutativity.
Proposition 1.49. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H .
(i) If S and T strongly commute, then S and T commute.
(ii) Let S, T ∈B(H ). Then, S and T strongly commute if and only if they
commute.
Proof. (i) Proposition 1.48(iv) is equivalent to [(S −w)(T −z)]−1 =
[(T −z)(S −w)]−1, for all z ∈ρ(T ) and w ∈ρ(S). Hence, (S −w)
(T −z) = (T −z)(S −w). This implies that D(ST ) ∩D(S) ⊂D((S −w)
(T −z)) = D((T −z)(S −w)) and hence, for all Ψ ∈D(ST ) ∩D(S),
Ψ ∈D(T S) and T SΨ = ST Ψ. In particular, for all Ψ ∈D(T S) ∩D(ST ),
[S, T ]Ψ = 0.
76
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) We need only to show that the commutativity of S and T implies
the strong commutativity of S and T . Let ST = T S. Then, it is easy to see
that (T −z)(S −w) = (S −w)(T −z), for all z, w ∈C. Hence, Proposition
1.48(iv) holds. Thus, S and T strongly commute.
□
Remark 1.13. In the case where at least one of S and T is unbounded,
the commutativity of S and T does not imply the strong commutativity of
S and T . One should be careful about this point.
The following proposition is also useful.
Proposition 1.50. Let T ∈B(H ) and S be a self-adjoint operator on H .
Then, T S ⊂ST if and only if T eitS = eitST, t ∈R.
Proof. Suppose that T S ⊂ST . Then, it is easy to see that, for all n ∈N,
T Sn ⊂SnT . Let RN(t) := N
n=0(itS)n/n!, t ∈R, N ∈N. Then, for all
Ψ ∈C∞
0 (S), T RN(t)Ψ = RN(t)T Ψ. We have limN→∞RN(t)Ψ = eitSΨ.
Hence, T eitSΨ = limN→∞RN(t)T Ψ. It is not so diﬃcult to show that, if
limN→∞RN(t)Φ ( Φ ∈C∞(S)) exists, then it is equal to eitSΦ. Hence,
T eitSΨ = eitST Ψ. Since C∞
0 (S) is dense and eitST and T eitS are bounded,
the operator equality eitST = T eitS follows.
Conversely, suppose that T eitS = eitST . Let Ψ ∈D(T S) = D(S). Then,
T eitSΨ = eitST Ψ, t ∈R · · · (∗). The vector-valued function :t →eitSΨ is
strongly diﬀerentiable with the strong derivative (eitSΨ)′ = iSeitSΨ. Since
T is bounded, it follows that T eitSΨ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t, with
(T eitSΨ)′ = iT SeitSΨ. Hence, by (∗), eitST Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t.
Therefore, according to Theorem 1.29(iv), T Ψ ∈D(S) (i.e., Ψ ∈D(ST ))
and (eitST Ψ)′ = iSeitST Ψ. Hence, iT SeitSΨ = iSeitST Ψ. Taking t = 0,
we obtain T SΨ = ST Ψ.

Joint spectral measure and joint spectrum
We now consider an N-tuple T = (T1, . . . , TN) of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H .
Theorem 1.37. There exists a unique N-dimensional spectral measure ET
such that
ET (B1 × · · · × BN) = ET1(B1) · · · ETN (BN),
Bj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , N.

77
Moreover,
Tj =

RN λjdET (λ),
j = 1, . . . , N,
where λ = (λ1, . . . , λN) ∈RN.
Proof. See, for example, Schm¨udgen (2012), Theorem 4.10; Arai (1997a),
Theorem 4.12; and Arai (2014b), Theorem 4.13.
□
The N-dimensional spectral measure ET in Theorem 1.37 is called
the joint spectral measure, or the product of the spectral measures,
ET1, . . . , ETN . The support
σJ(T ) := supp ET
of ET is called the joint spectrum of T .
A physical interpretation of the joint spectral measure ET and the
joint spectrum σJ(T ) in the context of quantum mechanics is as follows.
Suppose that each Tj represents a physical quantity (an observable) in
a quantum system. Then, the strong commutativity of T means that
the compatible measurements of T1, . . . , TN are possible. If the quantum
system is in a state represented by a unit vector Ψ ∈H (∥Ψ∥= 1),
then the probability that the result of a compatible measurement of
T lies in a Borel set B ⊂RN is ∥ET (B)Ψ∥2. The closure of the set
{λ ∈RN|λ is a result from the compatible measurement of T } is equal to
σJ(T ). But one should keep in mind that σJ(T ) is not necessarily the direct
product σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) (see Theorem 1.38 and an example in the
following section).
Theorem 1.38.
σJ(T ) ⊂σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN)
(1.86)
Proof. We have
ET (σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN)) = ET1(σ(T1)) · · · ETN (σ(TN)) = I · · · I = I.
Hence, (1.86) holds.
□
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the equality in (1.86) to hold is
given in the following theorem.
78
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 1.39. One has
σJ(T ) = σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN)
(1.87)
if and only if, for each λ ∈σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) and every ε > 0, ET1((λ1 −
ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0.
Proof. Suppose that (1.87) holds. Then, each λ ∈σ(T1)×· · ·×σ(TN) is in
σJ(T ) = supp ET . Hence, by Proposition 1.36, for all ε > 0, ET (Bε(λ)) ̸= 0.
One has Bε(λ) ⊂(λ1−ε, λ1+ε)×· · ·×(λN −ε, λN +ε). Hence, ET (Bε(λ)) ≤
ET1((λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)). Hence, ET1((λ1 −ε, λ1 +
ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0.
Conversely, suppose that, for each λ ∈σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) and every
ε > 0, ET1((λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε)) · · · ETN ((λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0. Then, ET ((λ1 −
ε, λ1 + ε) × · · · × (λN −ε, λN + ε)) ̸= 0. One has
(λ1 −ε, λ1 + ε) × · · · × (λN −ε, λN + ε) ⊂B√
Nε(λ).
Hence, ET (B√
Nε(λ)) ̸= 0. Therefore, by Proposition 1.36, λ ∈supp ET =
σJ(T ). Hence, σ(T1) × · · · × σ(TN) ⊂σJ(T ). Thus, (1.87) follows.

An example in quantum mechanics: A free relativistic
quantum particle
We consider a system of a free relativistic quantum particle with mass
m ≥0 in the (d + 1)-dimensional space-time, where d ∈N is the dimension
of the space part.23 To be deﬁnite, we denote the d-dimensional space Rd
as the position space for a particle by
Rd
x := {x = (x1, . . . , xd)|xj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d},
where an element x in Rd
x represents a position (a point) in the space Rd.
The momentum space of a particle in Rd
x is denoted by
Rd
p := {p = (p1, . . . , pd)|pj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d},
where an element p in Rd
p physically represents a momentum of the particle.
However, if there would be no danger of confusion, then we may write simply
Rd for Rd
x or Rd
p.
23Here, no detailed knowledge is needed on relativistic quantum mechanics. A review on
the special theory of relativity will be given in Section 8.10.
Theory of Linear Operators
79
The energy of a free relativistic particle with mass m and momentum
p ∈Rd
p is given by
Em(p) :=
(
p2c2 + m2c4,
(1.88)
where c is a parameter denoting the speed of light in vacuum and p2 :=
d
j=1(pj)2.
As is well known, one can take L2(Rd
x) as a Hilbert space of state vectors
of the quantum system consisting of a (not necessarily relativistic) quantum
particle in Rd
x. This choice of Hilbert space is called the coordinate rep-
resentation, or the q-representation. Another choice of Hilbert space is
given by L2(Rd
p). This is called the momentum representation. They are
naturally isomorphic under the Fourier transform Fd,ℏ: L2(Rd
x) →L2(Rd
p)
deﬁned by
(Fd,ℏf)(p) :=
1
(2πℏ)d/2

Rd e−ip·x/ℏf(x)dx,
f ∈L2(Rd
x),
(1.89)
where ℏis the reduced Planck constant, p·x := d
j=1 pjxj is the Euclidean
inner product of p and x, and the integral on the right-hand side is taken
in the sense of L2-convergence. Recall that Fd,ℏis unitary. If f ∈L2(Rd
x)
is integrable, then the right-hand side of (1.89) has meaning in itself as a
Lebesgue integral.
We denote by C∞
0 (Rd
x) the set of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions on Rd
x
with compact support.24 For each j = 1, . . . , d, we deﬁne a linear operator
∂j on L2(Rd
x) as follows:
D(∂j) := C∞
0 (Rd
x),
∂jf := ∂f
∂xj ,
f ∈D(∂j).
We call ∂j the partial diﬀerential operator in the variable xj. It is shown
that ∂j is closable. Hence, one can deﬁne
Dj := ∂j,
the closure of ∂j, which is called the generalized partial diﬀerential
operator in the variable xj.
The following theorem holds.25
24Recall that the support of a function f on Rd, denoted by supp f, is deﬁned by
supp f := {x ∈Rd|f(x) ̸= 0}. A subset C ⊂Rd is compact if and only if C is a bounded
closed set.
25For a proof, see, for example, Arai (1997a), Theorem 4.7.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 1.40. For each j = 1, . . . , d, the operator
ˆpj := iℏDj
(1.90)
is self-adjoint and C∞
0 (Rd
x) is a core of ˆpj. Moreover, for all a
=
(a1, . . . , ad) ∈Rd
x and f ∈L2(Rd
x),
(eia1 ˆp1/ℏeia2 ˆp2/ℏ· · · eiad ˆpd/ℏf)(x) = f(x −a),
a.e. x ∈Rd
x.
In particular, (ˆp1, . . . , ˆpd) is strongly commuting.
The operator ˆpj is called the jth momentum operator of a quantum
particle. We remark that, in non-relativistic quantum mechanics,
ˆpj := −ˆpj = −iℏDj
(1.91)
is called the jth momentum operator.
The operator
Δ :=
d

j=1
D2
j,
(1.92)
called the generalized d-dimensional Laplacian, is a non-positive self-
adjoint operator on L2(Rd
x).26 Hence,
Lm := −ℏ2c2Δ + m2c4
(1.93)
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L2(Rd
x). Therefore, using func-
tional calculus for Lm, one can deﬁne a non-negative self-adjoint operator:
ˆp0 := L1/2
m .
This operator is called the free relativistic Schr¨odinger operator on
L2(Rd
x). It may be physically interpreted as an operator representing the
Hamiltonian of a free relativistic quantum particle with mass m, but with-
out spin (angular momentum with respect to an internal degree of freedom).
In view of the notation in relativistic theory (see Section 8.10 for a
review of relativistic theory), for each p = (p1, . . . , pd) ∈Rd
p, we deﬁne a
d-tuple (p1, . . . , pd) ∈Rd by
pj := −pj,
j = 1, . . . , d.
26For a proof, see, for example, Arai (1997a), Chapter 5.
Theory of Linear Operators
81
Using Fourier analysis, we have the following operator equalities:
Fd,ℏLmF −1
d,ℏ= ME2m,
(1.94)
Fd,ℏˆp0F −1
d,ℏ= MEm,
(1.95)
Fd,ℏˆpjF −1
d,ℏ= Mpj,
j = 1, . . . , d,
(1.96)
where ME2m, MEm and Mpj are the multiplication operators by the func-
tions E2
m, Em, and p →pj ∈R, respectively. It follows from the unitary
invariance of the spectra of a linear operator and Corollary 1.2 that
σ(ˆp0) = {Em(p)|p ∈Rd} = [mc2, ∞),
σ(ˆpj) = {pj|p ∈Rd} = R.
Hence,
σ(ˆp0) × σ(ˆp1) × · · · × σ(ˆpd) = [mc2, ∞) × Rd.
(1.97)
The quantity mc2 is called the rest energy of a relativistic particle with
mass m.
With regard to the spectral measure Eˆpμ of ˆpμ, it follows from Theo-
rem 1.28 that
Fd,ℏEˆp0(B)F −1
d,ℏ= MχE−1
m (B),
(1.98)
Fd,ℏEˆpj(B)F −1
d,ℏ= Mχ{p∈Rd|pj ∈B},
B ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , d. (1.99)
Hence, Eˆpμ and Eˆpν commute for all μ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d. Therefore,
ˆp := (ˆp0, ˆp1, . . . , ˆpd)
is strongly commuting. Using the joint spectral measure Eˆp of ˆp, we have
ˆpμ =

R1+d pμdEˆp(p),
where p = (p0, p1, . . . , pd) ∈R1+d. The (1 + d)-tuple ˆp is called the
energy–momentum operator of a free relativistic quantum particle with
mass m.
By Theorem 1.38 and (1.97), the joint spectrum σJ(ˆp) of ˆp satisﬁes
σJ(ˆp) ⊂σ(ˆp0) × σ(ˆpj) × · · · × σ(ˆpd) = [mc2, ∞) × Rd.

But
σJ(ˆp) ̸= [mc2, ∞) × Rd.
This follows from Theorem 1.39 and the fact that, for δ > 0 and λ0 >

Eˆp0((λ0 −δ, λ0 + δ))Eˆp1((−δ, δ)) · · · Eˆpd((−δ, δ)) = 0,
which can be shown by using (1.98) and (1.99).
In fact, we can identify σJ(ˆp) exactly as follows. Let
Vm := {p ∈R1+d|p0 = Em(p)},
(1.101)
which is called the hyperbolic hypersurface with mass m (Fig. 1.6).
Theorem 1.41.
σJ(ˆp) = Vm.

This means that, for a.e. p ∈R1+d with respect to the measure ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2,
p2
0 = Em(p)2. Hence, supp ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2 ⊂{p ∈R1+d|p2
0 = Em(p)2}.
Theory of Linear Operators
83
Note that
supp ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2 ⊂σJ(ˆp) ⊂[mc2, ∞) × Rd.
Hence, supp ∥Eˆp(·)f∥2 ⊂Vm. In particular,
Eˆp(V c
m)f = 0.
Since ∩d
μ=0D(ˆp2
μ) is dense and Eˆp(V c
m) is bounded, it follows that
Eˆp(V c
m) = 0. Hence, σJ(ˆp) ⊂Vm.
To prove the converse inclusion relation, we apply Proposition 1.36. Let
a = (a0, a) ∈Vm be ﬁxed and ε > 0 be arbitrary. For each n >

deﬁne a closed interval in R1+d:

We have J ⊂Bε(a). Hence,
Eˆp(Bε(a)) ≥Eˆp0(J0)Eˆp1(J1) · · · Eˆpd(Jd),
where Jμ := [aμ −ε

n]. Therefore, for all f ∈L2(Rd),
∥Eˆp(Bε(a))f∥2 ≥Iε(f),
with
Iε(f) :=

{p∈Rd||Em(p)−Em(a)|≤ε/n,|pj−aj|≤ε/n,j=1,...,d}
|(Fd,ℏf)(p)|2dp.
By the continuity of Em, there exists a constant δ > 0 such that,
if |p −a| < δ, then |Em(p) −Em(a)| < ε/n. Therefore, letting r :=
min{δ, ε/n},
Iε(f) ≥

Br(a)
|(Fd,ℏf)(p)|2dp.
Hence, taking f = F −1
d,ℏχBr(a) ∈L2(Rd), we have Iε(f) ≥|Br(a)| > 0,
where |B| with B ∈Σ denotes the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure of B.
Therefore, Eˆp(Bε(a)) ̸= 0. Hence, by Proposition 1.36, a ∈σJ(Eˆp). Thus,
Vm ⊂σJ(Eˆp).

In the special relativity theory, Vm represents the set of energy–

Functional calculus of strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators
Let T = (T1, . . . , TN) be an N-tuple of mutually strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H . Then, one can develop the functional calculus with
respect to the joint spectral measure ET , as in Section 1.5.4, with d and
E replaced by N and ET , respectively. Hence, for each Borel measurable
function f on RN, one can deﬁne a linear operator f(T ) on H by
f(T ) :=

RN f(λ)dET (λ).
In the notation in Section 1.5.4, f(T ) is the operator IE(f) in the case
where d = N and E = ET . One can easily translate the statements in
Theorem 1.19 to those in terms of f(T ). But we omit writing them down
here.
Let f be a (not necessarily real-valued) continuous function on RN.
Then, by Theorem 1.19(iii), f(T ) is a densely deﬁned closed operator. In
particular, if f is real-valued, then f(T ) is self-adjoint (Theorem 1.19(vi)).
It may be useful if one can ﬁnd suitable cores for f(T ). For this purpose,
we introduce a subset:
D0(T ) :=
⎧
⎨
⎩

j=1
ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψ|Ψ ∈H , Rj > 0, j = 1, . . . , N
⎫
⎬
⎭. (1.103)
It is easy to see that D0(T ) is a subspace. Moreover, D0(T ) is dense in H
because, for all Ψ ∈H ,
lim
R→∞ET1([−R, R]) · · · ETN ([−R, R])Ψ = Ψ.
Lemma 1.8. Let f : RN →C be continuous. Then, D0(T ) ⊂D(f(T )).
Proof. Let Φ = N
j=1 ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψ ∈D0(T ). Then,

Theorem 1.42. Let f be a continuous function on RN. Then:
(i) σ(f(T )) = {f(λ)|λ ∈σJ(T )}.
(ii) The subspace D0(T ) is a core for f(T ).
(iii) If f is real-valued, then f(T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D0(T ).
Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 1.21.
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(f(T )) so that

RN |f(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞. For each
n ∈N, we take Ψn := ET1([−n, n]) · · · ETN ([−n, n])Ψ. Then, Ψn ∈D0(T )
and Ψn →Ψ as n →∞. Moreover, using functional calculus with respect
to ET ,
∥f(T )Ψn −f(T )Ψ∥2 = −

[−n,n]N |f(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2
+

RN |f(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2.
Applying the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, one sees that the
right-hand side converges to 0 as n →∞. Hence, f(T )Ψn →f(T )Ψ as
n →∞. Thus, D0(T ) is a core of f(T ).
(iii) This follows from (ii) and Proposition 1.32.

and
LP (T ) = P(T ).
(1.106)
Moreover,
σ(LP (T )) = {P(λ)|λ ∈σJ(T )}.
(1.107)
Proof. By Theorem 1.42(iii), P(T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D0(T ).
By (1.105), P(T ) ↾D0(T ) = LP (T ) ↾D0(T ). Hence, LP (T ) is essentially
self-adjoint on D0(T ), and (1.106) follows.
By (1.106), σ(LP (T )) = σ(P(T )). By this relation and Theorem 1.42(i),
we obtain (1.107).
□
We next consider the conditions under which LP(T ) itself is self-adjoint.
Theorem 1.44. Suppose that, for all kj = 0, 1, . . ., nj, j = 1, . . . , N with

Proof. Since (1.106) holds, we need only to show that D(P(T )) ⊂
D(LP (T )). Let Ψ ∈D(P(T )). Then,

RN |P(λ)|2d∥ET (λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞. By

The following theorem is concerned with a class of cores of LP(T ).
Theorem 1.45. Suppose that there exists a dense subspace D in H such
that D ⊂D(LP (T )) and, for j = 1, . . . , N and all R > 0, ETj([−R, R])
D ⊂D. Then, LP (T ) is essentially self-adjoint on D and (1.106) holds.
Proof. Let Φ ∈D0(T ). Then, there exist constants Rj > 0 (j = 1, . . . , N)
and a vector Ψ ∈H such that Φ = N
j=1 ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψ. Since D is
dense, there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D such that Ψn →Ψ (n →∞).
Let Φn := N
j=1 ETj([−Rj, Rj])Ψn. Then, under the present assumption,
Φn ∈D (∀n ∈N). It is easy to see that Φn →Φ and LP (T )Φn →LP (T )Φ
(n →∞). Hence, LP(T ) ↾D0(T ) ⊂LP (T ) ↾D. Using this result and
Theorem 1.43, we see that LP (T ) ↾D is self-adjoint and equal to P(T ). □
We apply Theorems 1.43 and 1.44 to special cases.

Strongly continuous multi-parameter unitary groups
Let T := (T1, . . . , Tn) (n ∈N) be a set of strongly commuting self-adjoint
operators on H . Then, for each t = (t1, . . . , tn) ∈Rn, one can deﬁne a
unitary operator by
UT (t) := eit1T1 · · · eitnTn.
It is easy to prove the following: (i) UT (0) = I; (ii) (group property)
UT (t + s) = UT (t)UT (s) = UT (s)UT (t), t, s ∈Rn; (iii) (strong continuity)
s- lims→0 UT (t + s) = UT (t), t ∈Rn.
Properties (ii) and (iii) above have an abstraction. A family of uni-
tary operators {U(t)}t∈Rn (n ∈N) on a Hilbert space H
is called a
strongly continuous n-parameter unitary group if it has the following
properties:
(I) (group property) U(t + s) = U(t)U(s), t, s ∈Rn (then it follows that
U(0) = I and U(t)U(s) = U(s)U(t), t, s ∈Rn);
(II) (strong continuity) s- lims→0 U(t + s) = U(t), t ∈Rn.
For a strongly continuous n-parameter unitary group, an extended ver-
sion of Stone’s theorem holds, as follows.
Theorem 1.46 (Extended Stone’s theorem). For each strongly con-
tinuous n-parameter unitary group {U(t)}t∈Rn, there exists a unique

n-tuple (T1, . . . , Tn) of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on H
such that
U(t) = eit1T1eit2T2 · · · eitnTn, t = (t1, . . . , tn) ∈Rn.
(1.114)
Proof. Let (ej)n
j=1 be the standard basis of Rn. Then, each t
=
(t1, . . . , tn) ∈Rn is written t = n
j=1 tjej. Hence, by the group property
of {U(t)}t∈Rn, we have U(t) = U(t1e1) · · · U(tnen). For each j = 1, . . . , n,
{U(tej)}t∈R is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Hence,
according to Stone’s theorem, there exists a unique self-adjoint operator
Tj on H such that U(tej) = eitTj, t ∈R. Therefore, (1.114) holds. For
j, k = 1, . . . , n and tj, tk ∈R, we have U(tjej)U(tkek) = U(tkek)U(tjej).
Hence, Tj and Tk strongly commute. The uniqueness of (T1, . . . , Tn) is easily
proved.

The self-adjoint operators T1, . . . , Tn in Theorem 1.46 are called the
inﬁnitesimal generators, or generators, of {U(t)}t∈Rn.

Reduction of Linear Operators
Let H be a Hilbert space and M be a closed subspace of H . We denote
by PM the orthogonal projection onto M . According to the projection
theorem, H has the orthogonal decomposition
H = M ⊕M ⊥,
(1.115)
where we use the natural identiﬁcation of a vector Ψ = Ψ1 + Ψ2 (Ψ1 =
PM Ψ, Ψ2 = PM ⊥Ψ), with (Ψ1, Ψ2) ∈M ⊕M ⊥.
A linear operator A on H is said to be reduced by M if PM A ⊂APM,
i.e., for all Ψ ∈D(A), PMΨ ∈D(A) and APMΨ = PM AΨ. In this case,
A is reduced by the orthogonal complement M ⊥of M too since I −PM
is the orthogonal projection onto M ⊥and (I −PM )A ⊂A(I −PM ).
Let A be reduced by M . Then, one can deﬁne a linear operator AM on
M as follows:
D(AM ) := D(A) ∩M ,
AMΨ := AΨ,
Ψ ∈D(AM ).
The operator AM is called the reduced part of A to M .
Theory of Linear Operators
91
Proposition 1.51. Let A be reduced by M . Then:
(i) The operator A has the direct sum decomposition
A = AM ⊕AM ⊥
(1.116)
relative to the orthogonal decomposition (1.115).
(ii) σ(A) = σ(AM ) ∪σ(AM ⊥).
(iii) ρ(A) = ρ(AM) ∩ρ(AM ⊥). Moreover, for all z ∈ρ(A), (A −z)−1 is
reduced by M and ((A −z)−1)M = (AM −z)−1.
(iv) Let B be a linear operator on H and reduced by M . Suppose that
A ⊂B. Then, AM ⊂BM.
Proof. (i) According to the projection theorem, each Ψ ∈D(A) has the
orthogonal decomposition Ψ = Ψ1 +Ψ2, with Ψ1 := PMΨ and Ψ2 := PM ⊥Ψ.
From the reducibility of A by M and M ⊥, we have Ψ1 ∈D(A) ∩M , Ψ2 ∈
D(A) ∩M ⊥and AΨ1 = AMΨ1, AΨ2 = AM ⊥Ψ2. Hence, AΨ = AMΨ1 +
AM ⊥Ψ2, implying A ⊂AM ⊕AM ⊥. It is easy to see that AM ⊕AM ⊥⊂A.
Hence, (1.116) holds.
(ii) This is a simple application of Theorem 1.15(ii).
(iii) The ﬁrst half follows from (ii). Let z ∈ρ(A). Then, using the
equality
A −z = (AM −z) ⊕(AM ⊥−z),
z ∈C,
(1.117)
one has
(A −z)−1 = (AM −z)−1 ⊕(AM ⊥−z)−1.
(1.118)
Thus, (A −z)−1 is reduced by M and ((A −z)−1)M = (AM −z)−1.
(iv) An easy exercise (Problem 16).
□
Remark 1.14. If A is reduced by M , then A leaves M and M ⊥invari-
ant in the sense that A(D(A) ∩M ) ⊂M · · · (∗) and A(D(A) ∩M ⊥) ⊂
M ⊥· · · (∗∗), respectively. If A ∈B(H ) (i.e., D(A) = H
and A is
bounded), then (∗) and (∗∗) imply the reducibility of A by M (see Propo-
sition 1.52, as follows). However, in the case where A is unbounded, (∗) and
(∗∗) do not necessarily imply the reducibility of A by M (see Problem 17).
In treating unbounded operators, one should be careful about this point.
Proposition 1.52. Let A ∈B(H ). Then, a necessary and suﬃcient con-
dition for A to be reduced by M is that AM ⊂M and AM ⊥⊂M ⊥.
92
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. The necessity of the condition follows from the deﬁnition of
reducibility.
To prove the suﬃciency of the condition, suppose that AM ⊂M and
AM ⊥⊂M ⊥. Then, for all Ψ ∈H , the identity AΨ = APMΨ + APM ⊥Ψ
gives the orthogonal decomposition of the vector AΨ relative to the orthog-
onal decomposition (1.115). Hence, PMAΨ = APM Ψ, PM ⊥AΨ = APM ⊥Ψ.
Thus, A is reduced by M .
□
Proposition 1.53. Let A and B be linear operators on H
which are
reduced by a closed subspace M ⊂H . Then, A + B is reduced by M
and (A + B)M = AM + BM.
Proof. An easy exercise (Problem 18).
□
Proposition 1.54. Let A be a linear operator on H which is reduced by
a closed subspace M ⊂H . Let K be a Hilbert space and U : H →K
be a unitary transformation. Let N := UM . Then, UM := U ↾M is a
unitary transformation from M to N , and UAU −1 is reduced by N , with
(UAU −1)N = UMAM U −1
M .
Proof. Let P := PM and Q := PN . Based on the present assumption,
PA ⊂AP. It is obvious that UP = QU. Hence, U −1Q = PU −1. Therefore,
(UAU −1)Q = UAPU −1 ⊃UPAU −1 = Q(UAU −1). Hence, UAU −1 is
reduced by N . It is easy to see that (UAU −1)N = UMAM U −1
M .
□
The following theorem summarizes the main properties of the reduced
part of a linear operator to a closed subspace. As is seen, the reduced part
inherits many properties from the original operator.
Theorem 1.47. Let A be a linear operator on H
reduced by a closed
subspace M .
(i) If D(A) is dense in H , then D(AM ) is dense in M .
(ii) If A is injective, then so is AM .
(iii) If A is surjective, then so is AM.
(iv) Suppose that A is closed. Then, AM is closed. Moreover, for any core
D of A, PMD is a core of AM.
(v) Suppose that A is closable. Then, AM is closable. Moreover, A is
reduced by M and (A)M = AM .
(vi) If A is bounded (D(A) is not necessarily equal to H ), then AM is
bounded with ∥AM∥≤∥A∥.
Theory of Linear Operators
93
(vii) If A is symmetric, then so is AM .
(viii) If A is an orthogonal projection, then so is AM .
(ix) Let A be self-adjoint. Then, AM is self-adjoint. Moreover, for each
Borel set J ∈B1, EA(J) (EA is the spectral measure of A) is reduced
by M —in this case, EA is said to be reduced by M — and the reduced
part EA(J)M is equal to EAM (J).
(x) If A is unitary, then so is AM.
(xi) If A is a contraction operator,27 then so is AM .
(xii) Let A be self-adjoint and B be a self-adjoint operator on H which
is reduced by M and strongly commutes with A. Then, AM and BM
strongly commute.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ
∈M . Then, by the density of D(A), there exists
a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(A) such that Ψn →Ψ as n →∞. Hence,
PM Ψn →PMΨ = Ψ as n →∞. Since PMΨn ∈D(AM ), it follows that
D(AM ) is dense in M .
(ii) For all Ψ ∈ker AM, AΨ = AMΨ = 0. Hence, under the present
assumption, Ψ = 0. Thus, AM is injective.
(iii) For each Ψ ∈M , there exists a vector Φ ∈D(A) such that AΦ = Ψ.
Hence, PM AΦ = Ψ. The left-hand side is equal to APM Φ = AMPM Φ.
Hence, AM is surjective.
(iv) Let Ψn ∈D(AM ), Ψn →Ψ ∈M , AMΨn →Φ ∈M (n →∞). Then,
Ψn ∈D(A) and AΨn →Φ (n →∞). By the closedness of A, Ψ ∈D(A) and
AΨ = Φ. Hence, Ψ ∈M ∩D(A) = D(AM ) and AMΨ = Φ. Thus, AM is
closed.
Let Ψ ∈D(AM ). Then, Ψ ∈D(A). Hence, there exists a sequence
{Ψn}∞
n=1 in D such that Ψn →Ψ, AΨn →AΨ (n →∞). Hence, letting
Φn = PM Ψn, we see that Φn ∈PM D, Φn →PMΨ = Ψ (n →∞) and
PM AΨn →PM AΨ (n →∞). On the other hand, PM AΨn = APM Ψn =
AΦn, PMAΨ = APM Ψ = AMΨ. Hence, AMΦn →AMΨ (n →∞). Thus,
PM D is a core of AM .
(v) Let Ψn ∈D(AM ), Ψn →0 and AMΨn →Φ ∈M (n →∞). Then,
AΨn →Φ (n →∞). Since A is closable, it follows from Proposition 1.5 that
Φ = 0. Hence, by Proposition 1.5 again, AM is closable.
Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then, there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(A) such
that Ψn →Ψ and AΨn →AΨ (n →∞). By the reducibility of A by
M , we have APM Ψn = PMAΨn. By the boundedness of PM , we have

operator if ∥T∥≤1.

PM Ψn →PM Ψ (n →∞) and APM Ψn = PMAΨn →PM AΨ (n →∞).
Hence, PMΨ ∈D(A) and APM Ψ = PM AΨ. Therefore, PM A ⊂APM.
Hence, A is reduced by M .
It is obvious that AM ⊂(A)M and hence AM ⊂(A)M. For each
Ψ ∈D((A)M), there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in D(AM ) such that Ψn →Ψ
and AM Ψn →(A)M Ψ (n →∞). Hence, Ψ ∈D(AM ) and AM Ψ = (A)MΨ.
Hence, D((A)M ) ⊂D(AM ). Thus, we obtain AM = (A)M.
(vi) In this case, for all Ψ ∈D(AM ), ∥AMΨ∥= ∥AΨ∥≤∥A∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence, AM is bounded with ∥AM∥≤∥A∥.
(vii) This follows from (i) and that, for all Ψ ∈D(AM ), ⟨Ψ, AMΨ⟩=
⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩∈R.
(viii) In the current case, AM ∈B(M ). Hence, by (vii), AM is self-
adjoint. Moreover, for all Ψ ∈M , A2
M Ψ = A2Ψ = AΨ = AM Ψ. Hence,
A2
M = AM . Thus, AM is an orthogonal projection.
(ix) By (vii), AM is symmetric. By (1.117), we have
A ± i = (AM ± i) ⊕(AM ⊥± i).
Since A is self-adjoint, Ran(A ± i) = H . Hence, Ran(AM ± i) = M . Thus,
AM is self-adjoint.
By Proposition 1.51(iii) and Stone’s formula (1.65), we see that
PM EA(J)PM is equal to EAM (J) on M . On the other hand, by (viii),
PM EA(J)PM is equal to EA(J)M on M . Hence, EAM (J) = EA(J)M.
(x) By (iii), AM is surjective. The norm-preserving property of AM
follows from that of A.
(xi) This follows from (vi).
(xii) Based on the present assumption, for all J, K ∈B1, EA(J) and
EB(K) commute. Hence, PMEA(J)PM and PM EB(K)PM commute. By
this fact and (ix), EAM (J) and EBM (K) commute.

Theorem 1.48. Let A and B be linear operators on H reduced by M .
Then, AB is reduced by M , and
(AB)M = AMBM.
(1.119)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(AB). Then, Ψ ∈D(B) and BΨ ∈D(A). The former
implies that PMΨ ∈D(B) and BPM Ψ = PM BΨ, The latter implies that
PM BΨ ∈D(A) and APM BΨ = PM ABΨ. Hence, BPMΨ ∈D(A) and
Theory of Linear Operators
95
ABPM Ψ = APM BΨ = PM ABΨ. Thus, AB is reduced by M . We have
D((AB)M ) = D(AB) ∩M = {Ψ ∈D(B) ∩M |BΨ ∈D(A)}
= {Ψ ∈D(BM )|BMΨ ∈D(A) ∩M }
= {Ψ ∈D(BM )|BMΨ ∈D(AM )}
= D(AM BM).
Thus, (1.119) follows.

The following theorem plays an important role in the theory of reduction
of self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 1.49. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on H reduced by a closed
subspace M . Then, for all Borel measurable functions f : R →C ∪{±∞},
f(S) is reduced by M , and
f(S)M = f(SM).
Proof. Let E be the spectral measure of S and P be the orthogonal pro-
jection onto M . Then, f(S) =

R f(λ)dE(λ). Let Ψ ∈D(f(S)) so that

R |f(λ)|2d∥E(λ)Ψ∥2 < ∞. Since PE(·) = EP(·) according to Theorem
1.47(ix), it follows that PΨ ∈D(f(S)) and, for all Φ ∈H ,
⟨Φ, f(S)PΨ⟩=

R
f(λ)d ⟨Φ, E(λ)PΨ⟩=

R
f(λ)d ⟨PΦ, E(λ)Ψ⟩
= ⟨PΦ, f(S)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, Pf(S)Ψ⟩.
Hence, f(S)PΨ = Pf(S)Ψ. Thus, f(S) is reduced by M . According to
Theorem 1.47(viii), the reduced part E(·)M of E(·) to M is the spectral
measure of SM. Using this fact, we see that D(f(S)M) = D(f(SM )) · · · (∗).
Moreover, for all Ψ ∈D(f(S)M ) and η ∈M ,
⟨η, f(S)MΨ⟩=

R
f(λ)d ⟨η, E(λ)Ψ⟩=

R
f(λ)d ⟨η, E(λ)M Ψ⟩
= ⟨η, f(SM)Ψ⟩.
Hence, f(S)MΨ = f(SM)Ψ. From this result and (∗), the operator equality
f(S)M = f(SM) follows.

Convergence of Self-Adjoint Operators
Let Hn (n ∈N) and H be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H .
Then, C\R ⊂ρ(Hn) ∩ρ(H). Hence, for all z ∈C\R, (Hn −z)−1 and
(H −z)−1 are in B(H ).
Deﬁnition 1.3.
(i) (strong resolvent convergence) The sequence {Hn}n of self-adjoint
operators is said to converge to H in the strong resolvent sense
if, for all z ∈C\R,
s- lim
n→∞(Hn −z)−1 = (H −z)−1,
where s- lim means the strong limit (i.e., limn→∞(Hn −z)−1Ψ =
(H −z)−1Ψ, Ψ ∈H ).
(ii) (norm resolvent convergence) The sequence {Hn}n of self-adjoint oper-
ators is said to converge to H in the norm resolvent sense if, for
all z ∈C\R, limn→∞∥(Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1∥= 0.
A basic criterion on strong resolvent convergence of a sequence of self-
adjoint operators is given in the following theorem.
Theorem 1.50. Suppose that there exists a core D for H such that
D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(Hn) and limn→∞HnΨ = HΨ, for all Ψ ∈D. Then, {Hn}n
converges to H in the strong resolvent sense.
Proof. Since D is a core for H, for all z ∈C\R, (H −z)D := {(H −z)
Ψ|Ψ ∈D} is dense in H . Let Φ ∈(H −z)D. Then. Ψ := (H −z)−1Φ
is in D. We have
(Hn −z)−1Φ −(H −z)−1Φ = (Hn −z)−1(H −Hn)Ψ.
Hence, using (1.67), we obtain
∥(Hn −z)−1Φ −(H −z)−1Φ∥≤
1
|Im z|∥(H −Hn)Ψ∥.
Hence, limn→∞(Hn −z)−1Φ = (H −z)−1Φ. Since supn∈N ∥(Hn −z)−1∥≤
1/|Im z| and (H −z)D is dense, it follows from Proposition A.3 in
Appendix A that s- limn→∞(Hn −z)−1 = (H −z)−1.

We next formulate a suﬃcient condition for {Hn}n to converge to H in
the norm resolvent sense. For this purpose, we ﬁrst prove a lemma, which
is useful.
Lemma 1.9. Let A be a closed operator on H such that D(A) ⊃D(H).
Then, for all z ∈ρ(H), A(H −z)−1 is bounded.
Proof. According to the closed graph theorem (Theorem 1.4), it is suﬃ-
cient to show that A(H −z)−1 is closed since D(A(H −z)−1) = H . Let
{Ψn}n be a sequence in H such that Ψn →Ψ ∈H and A(H −z)−1Ψn →
Φ ∈H
as n →∞. Then, (H −z)−1Ψn →(H −z)−1Ψ as n →∞.
Since A is closed, it follows that A(H −z)−1Ψ = Φ. Hence, A(H −z)−1 is
closed.
□
Theorem 1.51. Let A be a closed operator on H such that D(A) ⊃D(H).
Suppose that there exists a core D for H such that D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(Hn) and
∥(Hn −H)Ψ∥≤Cn∥AΨ∥,
Ψ ∈D,
(1.120)
with a sequence {Cn}n of positive numbers satisfying limn→∞Cn = 0.
Then, {Hn}n converges to H in the norm resolvent sense.
Proof. Let z ∈C\R and Φ ∈(H −z)D. Then,
((Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1)Φ = (Hn −z)−1(H −Hn)(H −z)−1Φ.
Hence,
∥((Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1)Φ∥≤
1
|Im z|∥(H −Hn)(H −z)−1Φ∥
≤
1
|Im z|Cn∥A(H −z)−1Φ∥(by (1.120))
≤
1
|Im z|Cn∥A(H −z)−1∥∥Φ∥,
where we have used Lemma 1.9. Since (H −z)D is dense, it follows that
∥(Hn −z)−1 −(H −z)−1∥≤
1
|Im z|Cn∥A(H −z)−1∥→0 (n →∞).

Important implications of strong resolvent convergence and norm resol-
vent convergence are stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 1.52.
(i) If {Hn}n converges to H in the strong resolvent sense, then, for all
bounded continuous functions f on R, s- limn→∞f(Hn) = f(H).
(ii) If {Hn}n converges to H in the norm resolvent sense, then, for
all bounded continuous functions f
on R vanishing at ∞(i.e.,
lim|x|→∞f(x) = 0), limn→∞∥f(Hn) −f(H)∥= 0.

Theorem VIII.20.
Corollary 1.9.
(i) If {Hn}n converges to H in the strong resolvent sense, then, for all
t ∈R, s- limn→∞e−itHn = e−itH.
(ii) If {Hn}n converges to H in the strong resolvent sense and there exists
a constant γ ∈R such that Hn, H ≥γ, for all n ≥1, then, for all
β ∈R, s- limn→∞e−βHn = e−βH.
(iii) If {Hn}n converges to H in the norm resolvent sense and there exists
a constant γ ∈R such that Hn, H ≥γ, for all n ≥1, then, for all
β > 0, limn→∞∥e−βHn −e−βH∥= 0.
Remark 1.15. In applications, strong and norm resolvent convergences
may also be useful for deriving some spectral properties of the limiting
operator H from those of Hn (n ∈N) (see, for example, Reed and Simon,

Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
For a ﬁnite number of Hilbert spaces, a new Hilbert space, called the tensor
product Hilbert space (or the tensor product) of them, is deﬁned. Some funda-
mental properties of tensor product Hilbert spaces are investigated. An important
class of tensor product Hilbert spaces is given by those of L2-spaces. Also dis-
cussed is the tensor product of a Hilbert space and one consisting of Hilbert
space-valued L2-functions. Moreover, symmetric tensor product Hilbert spaces
and anti-symmetric tensor product Hilbert spaces are introduced, which play
important roles in the quantum theory of many identical quantum particles.

V ×W := {(ψ, φ)|ψ ∈V , φ ∈W } to K is called a (K-valued) bilinear form
on V ×W if the following equations hold: for all ψ, ψ1, ψ2 ∈V , φ, φ1, φ2 ∈W
and α ∈K,
F(ψ1 + ψ2, φ) = F(ψ1, φ) + F(ψ2, φ),

F(ψ, φ1 + φ2) = F(ψ, φ1) + F(ψ, φ2),

a linear operator on V . Then, the mapping F : V × V →R deﬁned by
F(ψ, φ) := ⟨ψ, T φ⟩V (ψ, φ ∈V ) is a bilinear form on V .
Example 2.2. Let H be a complex inner product space, J : H →H

Then, F is a bilinear form on H .
2.1.2
Sesquilinear forms and a representation theorem
Let V and W be complex vector spaces. A mapping F : V × W →C is
called a sesquilinear form on V × W if (2.1)–(2.3) and
F(αψ, φ) = α∗F(ψ, φ)

In the case of W = V , we simply call F a sesquilinear form on V , or a
quadratic form on V .
A sesquilinear form F on V is said to be symmetric, or Hermitian,
if F(ψ, φ)∗= F(φ, ψ), ψ, φ ∈V . In this case, for all ψ ∈V , F(ψ, ψ) is
a real number. If a symmetric form F on V satisﬁes that, for all ψ ∈V ,
F(ψ, ψ) ≥0, then we say that F is positive or non-negative. A symmetric
form F is said to be positive deﬁnite if F is positive and F(ψ, ψ) = 0
implies ψ = 0. A positive deﬁnite symmetric form on V is nothing but an
inner product of V . On the other hand, a non-negative symmetric form is
called a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product (see Problem 1).
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
105
A sesquilinear form on a dense subspace of a Hilbert space may have an
operator representation.
Theorem 2.1. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and D be a dense sub-
space of H . Let F be a sesquilinear form on D such that there exist a bijec-
tive linear operator A on D(A : D →D) and a constant C > 0 satisfying
|F(ψ, φ)| ≤C∥ψ∥∥Aφ∥,
ψ, φ ∈D.
Then, there exists a unique linear operator T on H such that D(T ) = D
and
F(ψ, φ) = ⟨ψ, T φ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈D
(2.7)
and ∥T φ∥≤C∥Aφ∥, φ ∈D. Moreover, if F is symmetric (resp. non-
negative), then T is symmetric (resp. non-negative).
Proof. We ﬁx ψ ∈D and deﬁne ℓ: D →C by
ℓ(φ) := F(ψ, A−1φ),
φ ∈D.
It is easy to see that ℓis a linear functional on D, with |ℓ(φ)| ≤
(C∥ψ∥)∥φ∥, φ ∈D. Hence, ℓis a bounded linear functional on D with
∥ℓ∥≤C∥ψ∥. Therefore, according to the extension theorem, there exists
a unique ℓ∈H ∗such that ℓ⊂ℓand ∥ℓ∥= ∥ℓ∥. Hence, according to
Riesz’s representation theorem (Theorem 1.8), there exists a unique vector
uψ ∈H such that ℓ(φ) = ⟨uψ, φ⟩, φ ∈H and ∥uψ∥= ∥ℓ∥= ∥ℓ∥≤C∥ψ∥.
So, one can deﬁne a mapping L : D →H by Lψ := uψ, ψ ∈D. By the
aforementioned result on uψ, L is a bounded linear operator with ∥Lψ∥≤
C∥ψ∥, ψ ∈D. It follows that, for all ψ, φ ∈D. ⟨Lψ, φ⟩= F(ψ, A−1φ). This
means that F(ψ, φ) = ⟨Lψ, Aφ⟩= ⟨ψ, L∗Aφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈D, where we have
used the fact that (L)∗= L∗and D(L∗) = H . Hence, letting T := L∗A,
we obtain (2.7) (note that D(T ) = D(L∗A) = D(A) = D). The uniqueness
of T follows from the denseness of D. The last statement in the theorem is
easily proved.

Conjugate bilinear forms
Let V and W be complex vector spaces. A mapping F : V × W →C is
called a conjugate bilinear form on V × W if (2.1), (2.2), (2.5) and
F(ψ, αφ) = α∗F(ψ, φ)

hold for all ψ, ψ1, ψ2 ∈V , φ, φ1, φ2 ∈W and α ∈C. In the case W = V ,
we simply call F a conjugate bilinear form on V . As in (2.4) and (2.6), the
following formula holds:

We denote by L∗(V ×W ) the set of conjugate bilinear forms on V ×W .
For F, G ∈L∗(V × W ) and α ∈C, one can deﬁne the sum F + G ∈
L∗(V × W ) and the scalar multiple αF ∈L∗(V × W ) by
(F + G)(ψ, φ) := F(ψ, φ) + G(ψ, φ),
(αF)(ψ, φ) := αF(ψ, φ),
ψ ∈V , φ ∈W .
With this operation of addition and scalar multiplication, L∗(V × W )
becomes a complex vector space.
2.2
Tensor Product of Two Hilbert Spaces
In this section, we consider the case where both of the vector spaces V and
W are complex Hilbert spaces. Let H1 and H2 be complex Hilbert spaces.
For Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2, we deﬁne a mapping Ψ ⊗Φ : H1 × H2 →C by
(Ψ ⊗Φ)(ψ, φ) := ⟨ψ, Ψ⟩H1 ⟨φ, Φ⟩H2,
ψ ∈H1, φ ∈H2.
(2.8)
It is easy to see that Ψ ⊗Φ is a conjugate bilinear form on H1 × H2, i.e.,
an element of L∗(H1 × H2), and, for all n, m ∈N, Ψi ∈H1, Φj ∈H2 and
αi, βj ∈C (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m),

The conjugate bilinear form Ψ ⊗Φ is called the tensor product of Ψ and Φ.
Property (2.9) is called the bilinearity of tensor product.
Remark 2.1. Also, in the case where H1 and H2 are real Hilbert spaces,
the tensor product Ψ ⊗Φ of Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2 is deﬁned by (2.8). But,
in this case, Ψ ⊗Φ is a bilinear form on H1 × H2.
We recall a basic fact concerning an orthonormal system (ONS).
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
107
Theorem 2.2 (Abstract Riesz–Fischer theorem). Let
H be a Hilbert space over K and {en}∞
n=1 be an ONS in H . Then, for
all sequences c = {cn}∞
n=1 (cn ∈K, n ∈N) satisfying 
∞
n=1 |cn|2 < ∞, the
inﬁnite series Ψc := 
∞
n=1 cnen converges in H and ∥Ψc∥2 = 
∞
n=1 |cn|2.
In general, for a non-empty subset D of a vector space, we denote by
span D, or span (D), the set of ﬁnite linear combinations of vectors in D,
i.e., the subspace algebraically spanned by all vectors in D.
Let D1 and D2 be subspaces of H1 and H2, respectively. Then, we call
the subspace
D1 ˆ⊗D2 := span {Ψ ⊗Φ|Ψ ∈D1, Φ ∈D2} ⊂L∗(H1 × H2)
the algebraic tensor product of D1 and D2. It is obvious that
D1 ˆ⊗D2 ⊂H1 ˆ⊗H2.
Each element F in D1 ˆ⊗D2 is of the form
F =
n

i=1


j=1
αijΨi ⊗Θj,
with n, m ∈N, αij ∈C, Ψi ∈D1 and Θj ∈D2 (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m).
By the bilinearity of tensor product, we obtain
F =
n

i=1
Ψi ⊗Φi,
(2.10)
where Φi := 
m
j=1 αijΘj. This is a general form of an element in D1 ˆ⊗D2.
The following fact will be used in what follows.
Lemma 2.1. For each F ∈D1 ˆ⊗D2, there exist ONSs {ek}N
k=1 in D1,
{fl}M
l=1 in D2, with N, M ∈N and constants ckl ∈C(k = 1, . . . , N,
l = 1, . . . , M), such that

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We have (2.10). The subspaces M1 := span {Ψi|i = 1, . . . , n} and
M2 := span {Φi|i = 1, . . . , n} are ﬁnite dimensional. Let N and M be their
dimensions, respectively: N := dim M1 and M := dim M2. Then, we can
take an orthonormal basis {ek}N
k=1 of M1 and an orthonormal basis {fl}M
l=1
of M2. We have

⟨ek, Ψi⟩H1 ek,

Putting these equations into (2.10), we obtain (2.11), with ckl
:=

i=1 ⟨ek, Ψi⟩H1 ⟨fl, Φi⟩H2. Formula (2.12) easily follows from (2.11).
□
We next show that H1 ˆ⊗H2 has a natural inner product. For this pur-
pose, we ﬁrst note the following fact.
Lemma 2.2. There exists a unique symmetric form s on H1 ˆ⊗H2 such
that
s(Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ ′ ⊗Φ′) = ⟨Ψ, Ψ ′⟩H1 ⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2,
Ψ, Ψ ′ ∈H1, Φ, Φ′ ∈H2. (2.13)
Proof. Existence. Let F ∈H1 ˆ⊗H2 be as in (2.10), with Ψi ∈H1, Φi ∈H2,
and
G :=
m

j=1
Ψ ′
j ⊗Φ′
j,
(2.14)
with m ∈N, Ψ ′
j ∈H1 and Φ′
j ∈H2. Then, we deﬁne a mapping s :
(H1 ˆ⊗H2) × (H1 ˆ⊗H2) →C by
s(F, G) :=
n

i=1
m

j=1

Ψi, Ψ ′

(2.15)
Note that
s(F, G) =

.
It follows from this relation that s(F, G) is well deﬁned, i.e., the right-hand
side of (2.15) is independent of the way of representing F and G, as in
(2.10) and (2.14), respectively. Then, it is easy to see that s is a symmetric
form on (H1 ˆ⊗H2) × (H1 ˆ⊗H2), and (2.13) holds.
Uniqueness. Suppose that there exists another symmetric form s′ on
(H1 ˆ⊗H2)×(H1 ˆ⊗H2) such that s′(Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ ′⊗Φ′) = ⟨Ψ, Ψ ′⟩H1 ⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2, for
all Ψ, Ψ ′ ∈H1 and Φ, Φ′ ∈H2. Then, s′(Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ ′ ⊗Φ′) = s(Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ ′ ⊗Φ′),
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
109
for all Ψ, Ψ ′ ∈H1 and Φ, Φ′ ∈H2. It follows from the sesquilinearity of s
and s′ that, for all F, G ∈H1 ˆ⊗H2, s′(F, G) = s(F, G). Hence, s′ = s.
□
Lemma 2.3. The symmetric form s in Lemma 2.2 is an inner product of
H1 ˆ⊗H2.
Proof. We need only to prove the positive deﬁniteness of s. Let F be as in
(2.10), with Ψi ∈H1 and Φi ∈H2. Then, using the representation (2.11),
we have
s(F, F) =
N

k=1
M

l=1
|ckl|2.
Hence, s(F, F) ≥0.
Let s(F, F) = 0. Then, ckl = 0, for all k = 1, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . , M.
Hence, by (2.11), F = 0.
□
By Lemmas 2.2 and 2.3, the following deﬁnition is possible.
Deﬁnition 2.1. We denote by H1⊗H2 the completion of the inner product
space H1 ˆ⊗H2 with the inner product s and call it the tensor product
Hilbert space, or tensor product, of H1 and H2. We denote the inner
product of H1 ⊗H2 by ⟨F, G⟩H1⊗H2. An element of H1 ⊗H2 is called a
tensor.
In this way, one ﬁnds a structure making a new Hilbert space from each
pair of Hilbert spaces:
⊗: (H1, H2) →H1 ⊗H2.
By the deﬁnition of the completion of an inner product space, the alge-
braic tensor product H1 ˆ⊗H2 is identiﬁed with a dense subspace of H1⊗H2.
It follows from (2.13) that, for all Ψ, Ψ ′ ∈H1 and Φ, Φ′ ∈H2,
⟨Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ ′ ⊗Φ′⟩H1⊗H2 = ⟨Ψ, Ψ ′⟩H1 ⟨Φ, Φ′⟩H2.
(2.16)
In particular,
∥Ψ ⊗Φ∥H1⊗H2 = ∥Ψ∥H1∥Φ∥H2.
(2.17)
Remark 2.2. Also, in the case where H1 and H2 are real Hilbert spaces,
the tensor product Hilbert space H1 ⊗H2 is deﬁned in the same way as
above. But, in this case, H1 ⊗H2 is a real Hilbert space.
The following proposition states some fundamental structures of the
tensor product Hilbert space H1 ⊗H2.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proposition 2.1.
(i) (continuity of tensor product operation) Let Ψ, Ψn ∈H1 and Φ, Φn ∈
H2 such that limn→∞Ψn = Ψ, limn→∞Φn = Φ. Then, limn→∞Ψn ⊗
Φn = Ψ ⊗Φ.
(ii) If D1 and D2 are dense in H1 and H2, respectively, then D1 ˆ⊗D2 is
dense in H1 ⊗H2.
(iii) Let {Ψk}M
k=1 and {Φl}N
l=1 (N, M ∈N ∪{∞}) be the ONSs in H1 and
H2, respectively. Then, {Ψk ⊗Φl|k = 1, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . M} is an
ONS in H1 ⊗H2 and, for all double sequences a := {akl ∈C|k =
1, . . . , N, l = 1, . . . , M} satisfying 
N
k=1

M
l=1 |akl|2 < ∞,
Ψa :=

l=1

(2.18)
exists, with
∥Ψa∥2 =
N

k=1
M

l=1
|akl|2.
(2.19)
(iv) Let {Ψk}M
k=1 and {Φl}N
l=1 (N, M ∈N ∪{∞}) be complete orthonormal
systems (CONSs) of H1 and H2, respectively. Then, {Ψk ⊗Φl|1 ≤
k ≤M, 1 ≤l ≤N} is a CONS of H1 ⊗H2. In particular,
dim H1 ⊗H2 = MN.
Proof. Throughout the proof, we omit the subscript H1 ⊗H2 in the inner
product and the norm of H1 ⊗H2.
(i)
∥Ψn ⊗Φn −Ψ ⊗Φ∥= ∥(Ψn −Ψ) ⊗Φn + Ψ ⊗(Φn −Φ)∥
≤∥(Ψn −Ψ) ⊗Φn∥+ ∥Ψ ⊗(Φn −Φ)∥
(by triangle inequality)
= ∥Ψn −Ψ∥∥Φn∥+ ∥Ψ∥∥Φn −Φ∥
(by (2.17))
→0
(n →∞).
Hence, Ψn ⊗Φn →Ψ ⊗Φ (n →∞).
(ii) Since H1 ˆ⊗H2 is dense in H1⊗H2, it is suﬃcient to prove that D1 ˆ⊗D2
is dense in H1 ˆ⊗H2. Every element of H1 ˆ⊗H2 is a ﬁnite linear combi-
nation of tensors of the form Ψ ⊗Φ, with Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2. Hence,
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
111
it is enough to show that Ψ ⊗Φ is the limit of a sequence in D1 ˆ⊗D2.
Since Dj (j = 1, 2) is dense in Hj, there exist sequences {Ψn}∞
n=1 in
D1 and {Φn}∞
n=1 in D2 such that Ψn →Ψ, Φn →Φ (n →∞). It follows
from part (i) that Ψn ⊗Φn →Ψ ⊗Φ (n →∞). Since {Ψn ⊗Φn}∞
n=1 is
a sequence in D1 ˆ⊗D2, the desired result follows.
With regard to (iii) and (iv), we give a proof for the case of M =
N = ∞only; the other cases can be proved similarly.
(iii) Using (2.16), one easily sees that {Ψk⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1 is an ONS in H1⊗H2.
Hence, by Theorem 2.2, the inﬁnite series on the right-hand side of
(2.18) converges in H1 ⊗H2, and (2.19) holds.
(iv) Since H1 ˆ⊗H2 is dense in H1 ⊗H2, it is suﬃcient to show that
H1 ˆ⊗H2 ⊂span {Ψk ⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1,
(2.20)
where, for a subset D of a Hilbert space H , D denotes the closure of
D in H . Let Ψ ∈H1 and Φ ∈H2. Then, we have Ψ = 
∞
k=1 akΨk
and Φ = 
∞
l=1 blΦl, with ak := ⟨Ψk, Ψ⟩H1 and bl := ⟨Φl, Φ⟩H2. Let
Xn := 
n
k=1 akΨk and Yn := 
n
l=1 blΦl (n ∈N). Then, Xn →Ψ and
Yn →Φ (n →∞). Hence, by part (i), ∥Xn⊗Yn−Ψ ⊗Φ∥→0 (n →∞).
On the other hand, Xn ⊗Yn = 
n
k,l=1 akblΨk ⊗Ψl. Hence, Xn ⊗Yn ∈
span {Ψk ⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1. Therefore, Ψ ⊗Φ ∈span {Ψk ⊗Φl}∞
k,l=1. Thus,
(2.20) holds.
□
Remark 2.3. (i) Proposition 2.1(iv) implies that, if H1 and H2 are sepa-
rable, then so is H1 ⊗H2.
(ii) Proposition 2.1(iv) also holds in the case where H1 and H2 are
not necessarily separable, as is easily inferred from its proof. Namely, if
{Ψα}α∈A and {Φβ}β∈B with A and B being index sets are the CONSs of
H1 and H2, respectively, then {Ψα ⊗Φβ}α∈A,β∈B is a CONS of H1 ⊗H2.
For the closure of the algebraic tensor product of two subspaces, we
have the following.
Proposition 2.2. Let D1 (resp., D2) be a subspace of a Hilbert space H1
(resp., H2). Then,
D1 ˆ⊗D2 = D1 ⊗D2,
(2.21)
where the right-hand side is the tensor product Hilbert space of D1 and D2.1
1Recall that the closure D of a subspace D of a Hilbert space H is a closed subspace
of H and hence a Hilbert space with respect to the inner product of H .
112
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. It is obvious that D1 ˆ⊗D2 ⊂D 1 ˆ⊗D2 ⊂D1 ⊗D2. Hence, D1 ˆ⊗D2 ⊂
D1⊗D2. To prove the converse inclusion relation, let Ψ ∈D1⊗D2. Then, for
any ε > 0, there exists a vector Ψε ∈D1 ˆ⊗D2 such that ∥Ψε−Ψ∥< ε/2. It is
easy to see that there exists a vector Φε ∈D1 ˆ⊗D2 such that ∥Φε−Ψε∥< ε/2.
Hence, by the triangle inequality, we obtain ∥Φε−Ψ∥< ε. This implies that
Ψ ∈D1 ˆ⊗D2. Hence, D1 ⊗D2 ⊂D1 ˆ⊗D2. Thus, (2.21) holds.

Contraction of Tensor Products
Theorem 2.3.
(i) For each Ψ ∈H1 ⊗H2, there exists a unique anti-linear mapping C(1)
Ψ
from H1 to H2 such that, for all ψ1 ∈H1 and ψ2 ∈H2,
⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩=

(ii) For each Ψ ∈H1 ⊗H2, there exists a unique anti-linear mapping C(2)

C(2)

and ∥C(2)

Proof. (i) Let ψ1 ∈H1 be ﬁxed arbitrarily. Deﬁne f : H2 →C by
f(ψ2) := ⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩,
ψ2 ∈H2.
Then, it is easy to see that f ∈H ∗
2 , with ∥f∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ1∥. Hence,
according to the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique vector
ηΨ(ψ1) ∈H2 such that
f(ψ2) = ⟨ηΨ(ψ1), ψ2⟩H2,
ψ2 ∈H2
and ∥ηΨ(ψ1)∥= ∥f∥≤∥Ψ∥∥ψ1∥. Hence,
⟨Ψ, ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩= ⟨ηΨ(ψ1), ψ2⟩H2,
ψ2 ∈H2.
Then, one can deﬁne a mapping C(1)
Ψ
: H1 →H2 by
C(1)
Ψ (ψ1) = ηΨ(ψ1),
ψ1 ∈H1.

It is easy to see that C(1)

The vector C(1)

Tensor Product of N Hilbert Spaces with N ≥3
The method to deﬁne the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces given above
can be naturally extended to the case of N Hilbert spaces with N ≥3.
Let V1, . . . , VN be complex vector spaces. Then, a mapping F from the
direct product
V1 × · · · × VN := {(ψ1, . . . , ψN)|ψj ∈Vj, j = 1, . . . , N}
to C is called a conjugate N-linear form on V1 ×· · ·×VN if the following
equations hold: for all (ψ1, . . . , ψN) ∈V1 ×· · ·×VN, φj ∈Vj (j = 1, . . . , N)
and α ∈C,
F(ψ1, . . . ,

(2.22)
F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
αψj, . . . , ψN) = α∗F(ψ1, . . . ,
jth
ψ j, . . . , ψN).
(2.23)
We denote by L∗(V1 × · · · × VN) the set of conjugate N-linear forms on
V1 × · · · × VN. As in the case of N = 2, L∗(V1 × · · · × VN) becomes
a complex vector space with the natural operations of addition and scalar
multiplication. Generically, a conjugate N-linear form is called a conjugate
multi-linear form, or a conjugate multi-linear functional.
Remark 2.4. A concept slightly diﬀerent from the conjugate N-linear form
exists. A mapping F : V1 × · · · × VN →C is called an N-linear form on
V1×· · ·×VN if (2.22) and (2.23), with α∗replaced by α, hold. In particular,
114
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
a 2-linear form is a bilinear form. Generically, an N-linear form is called a
multi-linear form, or a multi-linear functional.
Let H1, . . . , HN be complex Hilbert spaces. Then, for each Ψj ∈Hj,
one can deﬁne a conjugate N-linear form ⊗N
j=1Ψj on H1 × · · · × HN by
(⊗N

j=1
⟨φj, Ψj⟩Hj,
φj ∈Hj, j = 1, . . . , N. (2.24)
The conjugate N-linear form ⊗N
j=1Ψj is called the tensor product of
vectors Ψ1, . . . , ΨN. This is also written as Ψ1 ⊗Ψ2 ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN.
Remark 2.5. Also, in the case where H1, . . . , HN are real Hilbert spaces,
the tensor product ⊗N
j=1Ψj of Ψ1 ∈H1, . . . , ΨN ∈HN is deﬁned by (2.24).
But, in this case, ⊗N
j=1Ψj is an N-linear form on H1 × · · · × HN.
We introduce a subspace of L∗(H1 × · · · × HN) by
ˆ⊗
N
j=1Hj := span {Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN|Ψj ∈Hj,
j = 1, . . . , N}
and call it the algebraic tensor product of H1, . . . , HN. This subspace
is also written as H1 ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗HN. As in the case of N = 2, there exists a

We denote by ⊗N
j=1Hj the completion of ˆ⊗
N
j=1Hj with respect to the inner

j=1Hj the tensor product Hilbert space, or tensor
product, of H1, . . . , HN. An element of ⊗N
j=1Hj is called a tensor of N
degree.
If H1 = H2 = · · · = HN = H , then we write ⊗N
j=1Hj = ⊗NH and
call it the N-fold tensor product of H .
As in the case N = 2, for a subspace Dj of Hj (j = 1, . . . , N), we deﬁne
ˆ⊗
N
j=1Dj by

Remark 2.6. Also, in the case where H1, . . . , HN are real Hilbert spaces,
the tensor product Hilbert space ⊗N
j=1Hj is deﬁned in the same way as
above. But, in this case, ⊗N
j=1HN is a real Hilbert space.
Proposition 2.1 is extended to the present case as follows.
Proposition 2.3.
(i) (continuity of tensor product operation) Let Ψ (j)
n , Ψ (j) ∈Hj and
limn→∞Ψ (j)

Ψ (j) (j

(ii) If Dj is a dense subspace of Hj(j = 1, . . . , N), then ˆ⊗

in ⊗N
j=1Hj.
(iii) Let {Ψ (j)
k }Mj
k=1(Mj ∈N ∪{∞}) be an ONS in Hj(j = 1, . . . , N).
Then, {⊗N
j=1Ψ (j)
kj |1 ≤kj ≤Mj, j = 1, . . . , N} is an ONS in ⊗N
j=1Hj.
Moreover, for all multiple sequences a = {ak1...kN ∈C|1 ≤kj ≤
Mj, j = 1, . . . , N} satisfying

k1,...,kN
|ak1···kN |2 < ∞,
Ψa :=

exists and
∥Ψa∥2 =

k1,...,kN
|ak1···kN |2.
(iv) Let {Ψ (j)
k }Mj
k=1 (Mj ∈N ∪{∞}) be a CONS of Hj (j = 1, . . . , N).
Then, {⊗N
j=1Ψ (j)
kj |1 ≤kj ≤Mj, j = 1, . . . , N} is a CONS of ⊗N
j=1Hj.
In particular,
dim ⊗N
j=1Hj = M1M2 · · · MN.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Proposition 2.1.
□
Remark 2.7. (i) Proposition 2.3(iv) implies that, if each Hj (j = 1, . . . , N)
is separable, then so is ⊗N
j=1Hj.
(ii) Proposition 2.3(iv) also holds in the case where each Hj (j = 1,

set, is a CONS of Hj (j = 1, . . . , N), then {⊗N

Hilbert Space Isomorphisms
Before developing further the theory of tensor product Hilbert spaces, we
recall here an important concept. Two Hilbert spaces H and K are said to
be isomorphic if there exists a unitary operator U from H to K . In this
case, we say that H is isomorphic to K under U, and we write H
U∼= K ,
or simply H ∼= K , if U is understood.
As is well known, every separable inﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert
space H is isomorphic to
ℓ2 :=

a = {an}∞
n=1
n ∈N, an ∈C,
∞

n=1
|an|2 < ∞

,
the Hilbert space of absolutely square summable sequences of complex num-
bers, in such a way that each ψ ∈H corresponds to {an(ψ)}∞
n=1 ∈ℓ2, with
an(ψ) = ⟨ψn, ψ⟩H , where {ψn}∞
n=1 is an arbitrary CONS of H . But this
isomorphism is not so useful because it depends on the choice of the CONS
of H , just giving a coordinate representation of each vector in H . One
may call an isomorphism depending on the choice of CONS a relative
isomorphism. We emphasize that a useful or meaningful Hilbert space
isomorphism may be one which has nothing to do with the CONSs of the
Hilbert spaces under consideration. We say that such an isomorphism is
absolute, or natural. As will be seen later in this book, natural isomor-
phisms play important roles in the theory of tensor product Hilbert spaces.
To establish an isomorphism between two Hilbert spaces, the following
theorem is fundamental.
Theorem 2.4 (Isomorphism theorem). Let H
and K
be Hilbert
spaces over K and {ψα}α∈A and {φα}α∈A be the CONSs of H and K ,
respectively, where A is an index set not necessarily at most countable.
Then, there exists a unique unitary transformation U : H →K such that
Uψα = φα,
α ∈A.
Proof. Existence. For each ψ ∈H , there is an at most countable sub-
set Aψ of A such that 
α∈Aψ | ⟨ψα, ψ⟩H |2 = ∥ψ∥2 < ∞. Hence, accord-
ing to the abstract Riesz–Fischer theorem, 
α∈Aψ ⟨ψα, ψ⟩H φα converges
in K . Therefore, one can deﬁne a mapping U : H
→K
by Uψ :=

α∈Aψ ⟨ψα, ψ⟩H φα. In particular, Uψα = φα. Then, it is easy to see
that U is linear and isometric (i.e., ∥Uψ∥K
= ∥ψ∥H ). To prove the
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
117
surjectivity of U, we note that, for each φ ∈K , 
α∈Bφ | ⟨φα, φ⟩K |2 =
∥φ∥2 < ∞, where Bφ is an at most countable subset of A. Hence,
ψ := 
α∈Bφ ⟨φα, φ⟩K ψα converges in H . Hence, Uψ = 
α∈Bφ ⟨φα, φ⟩K
φα = φ, showing that U is surjective. Thus, U is unitary.
Uniqueness. Let V : H →K be a bounded linear operator such that
V ψα = φα, α ∈A. Then, by the continuity of V , for all ψ ∈H ,
V ψ =

α∈Aψ
⟨ψα, ψ⟩H V ψα =

α∈Aψ
⟨ψα, ψ⟩H φα = Uψ.
Hence, V = U.
□
Remark 2.8. (i) The above-mentioned isomorphism between a separa-
ble inﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space and ℓ2 can be proved by
applying Theorem 2.4. Indeed, we need only to take, as a CONS of ℓ2, the
standard CONS {en}∞
n=1, with en := {0, . . . , 0,
nth
1 , 0, . . .}.
(ii) At ﬁrst sight, the isomorphism U in Theorem 2.4 may seem to
depend on the choice of CONSs, {ψα}α∈A and {φα}α∈A. But this is not
always the case (see, for example, Proposition 2.4). In applications, there
are many cases in which the isomorphism in Theorem 2.4 is in reality an
absolute isomorphism.
We now apply Theorem 2.4 to the tensor product of N Hilbert spaces
H1, . . . , HN over K.
We denote by SN the set of permutations of (1, . . . , N). To each
permutation σ ∈SN, the tensor product Hilbert space ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) is
associated.
Proposition 2.4. For each σ
∈
SN, there exists a unique unitary
transformation Uσ : ⊗N
j=1Hj →⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) such that, for all Ψj ∈Hj
(j = 1, . . . , N),
Uσ(Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN) = Ψσ(1) ⊗· · · ⊗Ψσ(N).
(2.25)
Proof. We prove the proposition only in the case where each Hj is
separable and inﬁnite dimensional (the proofs of the other cases are sim-
ilar). Let {Ψ (j)
k }∞
k=1 be a CONS of Hj. Then, by Proposition 2.3(iv), the

Thus, (2.25) holds.
□
Proposition 2.4 shows that ⊗N
j=1Hj is isomorphic to ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j) under
Uσ. As is seen, this isomorphism has nothing to do with the CONS of
⊗N
j=1Hj. Based on this fact, we say that Uσ is a natural isomorphism
of ⊗N
j=1Hj, with ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j). This natural isomorphism is written as
⊗N
j=1Hj ∼= ⊗N
j=1Hσ(j).

Tensor Product of L2-Spaces
Let (Xj, Σj, μj) (j = 1, . . . , N) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space. Then, using
the theory in Section 2.4, we can consider the tensor product Hilbert space
⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dμj). But this Hilbert space is an abstract one. Hence, it would
be natural to ask if ⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dμj) can be identiﬁed with a concrete
Hilbert space. In what follows, we show that the answer is aﬃrmative.
Since each measure space (Xj, Σj, μj) is σ-ﬁnite, the direct product
space X1×· · ·×XN becomes a measure space whose Borel ﬁeld and measure
are the product Borel ﬁeld of Σ1, . . . , ΣN and the product measure μ1 ⊗
· · · ⊗μN, respectively.

For a measurable function fj on Xj (j = 1, . . . , N), we deﬁne a measur-
able function f1 × · · · × fN on X1 × · · · × XN by
(f1 × · · · × fN)(x) := f1(x1) · · · fN(xN),
for μ1 ⊗· · · ⊗μN-a.e. x = (x1, . . . , xN) ∈X1 × · · · × XN. It follows that, if
fj ∈L2(Xj, dμj), for all j = 1, . . . , N, then
f1 × · · · × fN ∈L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dμ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dμN),
with
∥f1 × · · · × fN∥=
N

j=1
∥fj∥,
where dμ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dμN := d(μ1 ⊗· · · ⊗μN).
We ﬁrst note an elementary fact.
Proposition 2.5 (Continuity of ×-operation). Let f (j)
n , f (j)
∈
L2
(Xj, dμj) (n
∈
N, j
=
1, . . . , N) such that limn→∞f (j)
n

f (j) in
L2(Xj, dμj), j = 1, . . . , N. Then,
lim
n→∞f (1)

n
= f (1) × · · · × f (N)
(2.27)
in L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dμ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dμN).
Proof. We prove (2.27) only for the case of N = 2 (the case N ≥3 can
be proved by induction in N). We set fn := f (1)
n , f := f (1), gn := f (2)
n ,
g := f (2). For μ1 ⊗μ2-a.e. (x1, x2) ∈X1 × X2,
(fn × gn)(x1, x2) −(f × g)(x1, x2)
= (fn(x1) −f(x1))gn(x2) + f(x1)(gn(x2) −g(x2)).
Hence,
∥fn × gn −f × g∥≤∥fn −f∥∥gn∥+ ∥f∥∥fn −g∥→0
as n →∞.
□
The following proposition describes a structure which yields a CONS
of L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dμ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dμN) from the CONSs of L2(Xj, dμj),
j = 1, . . . , N.
Proposition
2.6. Let {f (j)
nj }nj∈N
be a CONS of L2(Xj, dμj) (j
=
1, . . . , N). Then, {f (1)
n1 × · · · × f (N)
nN |nj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N} is a CONS of
L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dμ1 ⊗· · · ⊗dμN).
120
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We prove the proposition only in the case of N = 2 (the case
N ≥3 can be proved by induction in N). We put fn := f (1)
n
and gm := f (2)
m
(n, m ∈N). It is easy to see that D := {fn × gm}n,m∈N is an ONS in
L2(X1 × X2, dμ1 ⊗dμ2). Hence, we need only to show that the orthogo-
nal complement D⊥of D is {0}. Let f ∈D⊥. Then, for all n, m ∈N,
⟨f, fn × gm⟩= 0. Hence,

X1×X2 f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)gm(x2)dμ1 ⊗dμ2 = 0.
Using the elementary inequality
|αβ| ≤1
2(|α|2 + |β|2),
α, β ∈C,
(2.28)
one has
|f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)gm(x2)| ≤1
2|f(x1, x2)|2 + 1
2|fn(x1)|2|gm(x2)|2.
Hence, the function |f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)gm(x2)| is integrable with respect to
μ1⊗μ2 (this can be proved using the Schwarz inequality also). Hence, letting
Fn(x2) :=

X1 f(x1, x2)fn(x1)∗dμ1(x1), we have by Fubini’s theorem,

X2
Fn(x2)∗gm(x2)dμ2(x2) = 0.
Using the Schwarz inequality, we have
|Fn(x2)|2 ≤

X1
|f(x1, x2)|2dμ1(x1)

∥fn∥2.
Hence, it follows that Fn ∈L2(X2, dμ2). Therefore, ⟨Fn, gm⟩= 0, n, m ∈N.
Since {gm}m∈N is a CONS of L2(X2, dμ2), it follows that Fn = 0, n ∈N.
Hence, there exists a measurable set Nn ⊂X2 such that μ2(Nn) = 0 and,
for all x2 ∈X2 \ Nn,

X1 f(x1, x2)∗fn(x1)dμ1(x1) = 0, i.e., ⟨gx2, fn⟩= 0,
x2 ∈X2 \ Nn, where gx2(x1) := f(x1, x2) (note that gx2 ∈L2(X1, dμ1),
for μ2-a.e. x2 ∈X2). Let N0 := ∪∞
n=1Nn. Then, μ2(N0) = 0 and, for all
x2 ∈X2 \ N0 and n ∈N, ⟨gx2, fn⟩= 0. Hence, gx2 = 0, x2 ∈X2 \ N0.
This implies that

X2 dμ2(x2)

X1 |f(x1, x2)|2dμ1(x1) = 0. It follows form
Fubini’s theorem again that f = 0. Thus, D⊥= {0}, as desired.

The main result in this section is as follows.

Proof. We give a proof only for the case of N = 2, and L2(Xj, dμj) is
inﬁnite dimensional (j = 1, 2). Let fn and gm be as in the proof of Propo-
sition 2.6. Then, by Proposition 2.6 and Theorem 2.4, there exists a unique
unitary transformation U : L2(X1, dμ1)⊗L2(X2, dμ2) →L2(X1×X2, dμ1⊗

Theorem 2.5 shows that the tensor product ⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dμj) is isomor-
phic to L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dμ1 ⊗· · · dμN). As is seen, this isomorphism
is independent of the CONSs of the Hilbert spaces under consideration
and gives a harmonious correspondence (2.29). We call the isomorphism
in Theorem 2.5 the natural isomorphism between ⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dμj) and
L2(X1×· · ·×XN, dμ1⊗· · · dμN). In the sense of this isomorphism, we write
⊗N
j=1L2(Xj, dμj) ∼= L2(X1 × · · · × XN, dμ1 ⊗· · · dμN).
Example 2.4. Let d ∈N and take Xj = Rd, Σj = Bd (the Borel ﬁeld
of Rd) with μj being the Lebesgue measure on the Borel-measurable space
(Rd, Bd) so that L2(Xj, dμj) = L2(Rd). Then, by Theorem 2.5, we have
⊗NL2(Rd) ∼= L2((Rd)N) = L2(RdN).
This natural isomorphism is very useful in applications to mathematical
theory of quantum many-body systems.

Tensor Product of an L2-Space and a Hilbert Space
Let (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space and H be a complex Hilbert space. Then,
the tensor product Hilbert space L2(X, dμ) ⊗H
is considered. In this
section, we describe a natural isomorphism of L2(X, dμ)⊗H to a concrete
Hilbert space.
122
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let
H X := {F : X →H },
the set of mappings from X to H . Then, for F, G ∈H X, the pointwise
inner product ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H (x ∈X) gives a complex-valued function on
X: x →⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H . It may be natural to deﬁne an inner product of F
and G by 
X ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H dμ(x) if ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H is Σ-measurable and
integrable with respect to μ. With this heuristic motivation, we introduce
the concept of measurability for the elements of H X.
Deﬁnition
2.2. An
element
F
∈
H X
is
said
to
be
weakly
Σ-measurable, or weakly measurable, if, for all Ψ ∈H , the complex-
valued function : X ∋x →⟨Ψ, F(x)⟩H on X is Σ-measurable. We denote
by M(X, H ) the set of weakly Σ-measurable mappings from X to H .
Remark 2.9. Besides the weak measurability, there are two diﬀerent con-
cepts of measurability for the elements of H X, called strong measura-
bility and Borel measurability, respectively (see, for example, Reed and
Simon, 1980, pp. 115–116). One has the following logical relation (Reed and
Simon, 1980, p. 116, Proposition):
strongly measurable =⇒Borel measurable =⇒weakly measurable
But, it turns out that, in the case where H is separable, these three con-
cepts of measurability are equivalent (Reed and Simon, 1980, Theorem
IV.22). In many cases of applications of the theory on the mapping space
H X to quantum ﬁeld theory, H is separable. Therefore, for the purpose
of this book, it is enough to consider the case where H is separable and
weak measurable functions in H X.
Throughout this section, we assume that H is separable.
Lemma 2.4. For all F, G ∈M(X, H ), the function : X
∋x →
⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H on X is Σ-measurable. In particular, the function : X ∋
x →∥F(x)∥2
H is Σ-measurable.
Proof. Let {Φn}n∈N be a CONS of H (we give a proof only in the case
where H is inﬁnite dimensional). Then, we have
⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H = lim
N→∞
N

n=1
⟨F(x), Φn⟩H ⟨Φn, G(x)⟩H .
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
123
Since the function x →
N
n=1 ⟨F(x), Φn⟩H ⟨Φn, G(x)⟩H is Σ-measurable
and the limit of a sequence of Σ-measurable functions is Σ-measurable, it
follows that ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H is Σ-measurable.
□
By virtue of Lemma 2.4, one can deﬁne
L2(X, dμ; H ) :=

F ∈M(X, H )|

X
∥F(x)∥2
H dμ(x) < ∞

.
(2.31)
We call it the L2-space of H -valued functions on the measure
space (X, Σ, μ). In L2(X, dμ; H ), the concept of equality F = G (F, G ∈
L2(X, dμ; H )) is deﬁned as follows:
F = G
def
⇐⇒F(x) = G(x) for μ-a.e. x ∈X.
It follows from the Schwarz inequality for inner product and (2.28) that
| ⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H | ≤1
2(∥F(x)∥2
H + ∥G(x)∥2
H ),
F, G ∈H X, x ∈X.
Hence, for all F, G ∈L2(X, dμ; H ), one can deﬁne a complex number
⟨F, G⟩L2(X,dμ;H ) by
⟨F, G⟩L2(X,dμ;H ) :=

X
⟨F(x), G(x)⟩H dμ(x).
It is easy to see that the mapping: (F, G) →⟨F, G⟩L2(X,dμ;H ) is an inner
product of L2(X, dμ; H ). Moreover, in the same way as in the proof of com-
pleteness of L2(X, dμ) (= L2(X, dμ; C)), one can prove that L2(X, dμ; H )
is complete with respect to the inner product ⟨, ⟩L2(X,dμ;H ) (Problem 8).
Thus, L2(X, dμ; H ) is a Hilbert space with inner product ⟨, ⟩L2(X,dμ;H ).
For a Σ-measurable function f on X such that |f(x)| < ∞for μ-a.e. x ∈
X and Ψ ∈H , we deﬁne an element f × Ψ in M(X, H ) by
(f × Ψ)(x) := f(x)Ψ,
μ-a.e. x ∈X.
We call f ×Ψ the product of f and Ψ. As is easily seen, if f is in L2(X, dμ),
then f × Ψ ∈L2(X, dμ; H ) and, for all g ∈L2(X, dμ) and Φ ∈H ,
⟨f × Ψ, g × Φ⟩L2(X,dμ;H ) = ⟨f, g⟩L2(X,dμ) ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩H .
(2.32)
Proposition 2.7. Let fn, f ∈L2(X, dμ) and Ψn, Ψ ∈H
be such that
limn→∞fn = f and limn→∞Ψn = Ψ. Then, limn→∞fn × Ψn = f × Ψ.

Proposition 2.8. Let {fm}∞
m=1 be a CONS of L2(X, dμ) and {Φn}∞
n=1 be
a CONS of H . Then, {fm × Φn}m,n∈N is a CONS of L2(X, dμ; H ).
Proof. The orthonormality of {fm × Φn}m,n∈N follows from (2.32). To
prove its completeness, let F ∈({fm × Φn}m,n∈N)⊥so that ⟨F, fm × Φn⟩
= 0, m, n ∈N. This implies that

X ⟨F(x), Φn⟩fm(x)dμ(x) = 0, m, n ∈
N. Hence, in the same way as in the proof of Proposition 2.6, one can
show that, for all n ∈N, ⟨F(x), Φn⟩= 0, μ-a.e. x. Hence, F(x) = 0 for
μ-a.e. x, implying F = 0 as an element of L2(X, dμ; H ). Thus, the ONS
{fm × Φn}m,n∈N in L2(X, dμ; H ) is complete.
□
Theorem 2.6. Suppose that L2(X, dμ) is separable. Then, there exists a
unique unitary transformation : L2(X, dμ)⊗H →L2(X, dμ; H ) such that
U(f ⊗Ψ) = f × Ψ,
f ∈L2(X, dμ), Ψ ∈H .
Proof. Let {fm}∞
m=1 and {Φn}∞
n=1 be as in Proposition 2.8. Then, by this
proposition, Proposition 2.1(iv) and Theorem 2.4, there exists a unique
unitary transformation U : L2(X, dμ) ⊗H
→L2(X, dμ; H ) such that
U(fm ⊗Φn) = fm × Φn, m, n ∈N. For all f ∈L2(X, dμ) and Ψ ∈H , we
have

□
The unitary transformation U in Theorem 2.6 gives an isomorphism
between L2(X, dμ) ⊗H and L2(X, dμ; H ). We call this isomorphism the
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
125
natural isomorphism between L2(X, dμ) ⊗H and L2(X, dμ; H ) and
write
L2(X, dμ) ⊗H ∼= L2(X, dμ; H ).
By this fact and Proposition 2.4, we have
H ⊗L2(X, dμ) ∼= L2(X, dμ; H ),
with correspondence Ψ ⊗f →f × Ψ (f ∈L2(X, dμ), Ψ ∈H ).
Example 2.5. Let d, r ∈N and Cr := {(z1, . . . , zr)|zj ∈C, j = 1, . . . , r},
the r-dimensional complex Euclidean (Hermitian) space. Then,
L2(Rd) ⊗Cr ∼= L2(Rd, dx; Cr) ∼= Cr ⊗L2(Rd).
Henceforth, we write L2(Rd; Cr) instead of L2(Rd, dx; Cr). In applications
to quantum mechanics, L2(Rd; Cr) describes a Hilbert space of state vec-
tors of a quantum system consisting of a quantum particle (an elementary
particle, an atom, a molecule, an ion etc.) in Rd with internal degrees of
freedom.2
Corollary 2.1. Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N, N ≥2) be separable Hilbert spaces
and (Xj, Σj, μj) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space such that each L2(Xj, dμj)
is separable. Then, there exists a unique unitary transformation U

such that, for all fj ∈L2(Xj, dμj) and Ψj ∈Hj (j = 1, . . . , N),
U(f1 ⊗Ψ1) ⊗· · · ⊗(fN ⊗ΨN) = (f1 × · · · × fN) × (⊗N

2In quantum mechanics, a state of a quantum system S is described by a ray [Ψ] :=
{αΨ|α ∈C \ {0}} for a non-zero vector Ψ in a Hilbert space H . A vector in [Ψ] is called
a state vector of the state [Ψ], and H is called a Hilbert space of states for S. It
is obvious that the two states [Ψ] and [Φ] (Φ ∈H ) are identical (i.e., Ψ represents the
same state as that Φ does) if and only there exists a non-zero constant α ∈C such that
Ψ = αΦ.

Constant Fiber Direct Integrals
There is another viewpoint to L2(X, dμ; H ).
Example 2.7. Let δa be the delta measure with support {a} ⊂X (i.e., for
each B ∈Σ, δa(B) = 1 if a ∈B and δa(B) = 0 if a ̸∈B), and consider the
case where μ = μn := 
n
j=1 δaj (a1, . . . , an ∈X, aj ̸= ak, j ̸= k). Then, for
all f ∈L2(X, dμn; H ), ∥f∥2 =

X ∥f(x)∥2dμn = 
n
j=1 ∥f(aj)∥2. Hence,
one can deﬁne a mapping Wn : L2(X, dμn; H ) →⊕nH by
Wnf := (f(a1), . . . , f(an)) ∈⊕nH .
It follows that Wn is unitary. Hence, L2(X, dμn; H )
Wn
∼= ⊕nH . In this
sense, we write L2(X, dμn; H ) = ⊕nH .
As a generalization of the viewpoint shown in the preceding example,
one can take a similar viewpoint in the case of a general measure μ on
(X, Σ) too. Namely, for each element ψ in L2(X, dμ; H ), one can assign
an element ˜ψ = (ψ(x))x∈X in the direct product 
x∈X Hx of Hx = H
(∀x ∈X) with inner product

˜ψ, ˜φ

:=

X
⟨ψ(x), φ(x)⟩H dμ(x),
˜φ = (φ(x))x∈X, φ ∈L2(X, dμ; H ).
From this viewpoint, we write
L2(X, dμ; H ) =
 ⊕
X
H dμ
and call it the constant ﬁber direct integral over (X, μ) with ﬁber H .
Let A(·) be a mapping from X to L(H ) (the set of linear operators
on H ) (i.e., for each x ∈X, A(x) ∈L(H )). We remark that A(x) is not
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
127
necessarily bounded. From this mapping, a linear operator A on
 ⊕
X H dμ
is deﬁned as follows:
D(A) :=

ψ ∈
 ⊕
X
H dμ
for a.e. x, ψ(x) ∈D(A(x)) and
A(·)ψ(·) ∈M(X, H ) with

X ∥A(x)ψ(x)∥2dμ(x) < ∞

,
(2.33)
(Aψ)(x) := A(x)ψ(x),
a.e. x,
ψ ∈D(A).
(2.34)
The operator A is called the direct integral operator (or simply the
direct integral) of {A(x)}x∈X, or A(·), with respect to μ and written as
A =
 ⊕
X A(x)dμ(x).
An operator A on
 ⊕
X H dμ is said to be decomposable if there is a
mapping A(·) : X →L(H ) such that (2.33) and (2.34) hold.
A mapping A(·) : X →L(H ) is called a constant-operator-valued
mapping if there is an operator C ∈L(H ) such that, for all x ∈X,
A(x) = C. In this case, we write
 ⊕
X A(x)dμ =
 ⊕
X Cdμ.
Deﬁnition 2.3. A bounded operator-valued mapping B(·) : X →B(H )
on X (i.e., for each x ∈X, B(x) ∈B(H )) is said to be measurable if,
for all ψ, φ ∈H, the function : X∋x →⟨ψ, B(x)φ⟩∈C is measurable.
Lemma 2.5. Let B(·) : X →B(H ) be measurable such that, for some
constant b > 0,
∥B(x)∥≤b,
a.e. x ∈X.
Then, B =
 ⊕
X B(x)dμ(x) is an everywhere deﬁned bounded operator on
L2(X, dμ; H ) and ∥B∥≤b.
Proof. Since D(B(x)) = H , for all ψ ∈
 ⊕
X H dμ(x), B(x)ψ(x) is measur-
able, and

X
∥B(x)ψ(x)∥2dμ(x) ≤b2∥ψ∥2 < ∞.
Hence, D(B) = L2(X, dμ; H ) and ∥Bψ∥≤b∥ψ∥. Thus, the desired result
follows.
□
In applications to quantum physics, it is important to know when a
decomposable operator A =
 ⊕
X A(x)dμ(x) becomes self-adjoint. Hence, we
next consider a suﬃcient condition for A to be self-adjoint.
128
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Deﬁnition 2.4. A mapping A(·) : X →L(H ) is called a self-adjoint
mapping if, for each x ∈X, A(x) is self-adjoint and the mapping : X ∋
x →(A(x) + i)−1 ∈B(H ) is measurable.
Lemma 2.6. Let A(·) : X →L(H ) be a self-adjoint mapping. Then, the
mapping : X ∋x →(A(x) −i)−1 ∈B(H ) is measurable.
Proof. Under the present assumption, for all ψ, φ ∈H , the function : X ∋
x →

ψ, (A(x) + i)−1φ

∈C is measurable. Hence, the mapping : X ∋x →

ψ, (A(x) + i)−1φ
∗∈C is also measurable. Since A(x) is self-adjoint, it
follows that

ψ, (A(x) + i)−1φ
∗=

φ, (A(x) −i)−1ψ

. Thus, the mapping
: x →(A(x) −i)−1 is measurable.
□
Theorem 2.7. Let A(·) : X →L(H ) be a self-adjoint mapping. Then,
A =
 ⊕
X A(x)dμ(x) is self-adjoint.
Proof. By Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6, C± :=
 ⊕
X (A(x) ± i)−1dμ(x) are bounded
operators on L2(X, dμ; H ). It is easy to see that C± are injective. Since
A(x)(A(x) + i)−1 = 1 −i(A(x) + i)−1,
x ∈X,
A(x)(A(x) + i)−1 is bounded with ∥A(x)(A(x) + i)−1∥≤2, and the
mapping : x →A(x)(A(x) + i)−1 is measurable. For all φ ∈L2(X, dμ; H ),

X
∥A(x)(A(x) + i)−1φ(x)∥2dμ(x) ≤4∥φ∥2 < ∞.
Hence, C+φ ∈D(A). By direct computations, one obtains (A + i)C+φ
= φ. Hence, (A + i)C+ = I. Similarly, one can show that (A −i)C−= I.
Therefore, Ran(A ± i) = L2(X, dμ; H ). It is easy to see that, for all ψ,
φ ∈D(A), ⟨ψ, Aφ⟩= ⟨Aψ, φ⟩. Hence, if D(A) is dense, then it follows from
a basic criterion on self-adjointness (Proposition 1.28) that A is self-adjoint.
To show that D(A) is dense, let φ ∈D(A)⊥. Then, for all ψ ∈D(A),
0 = ⟨φ, ψ⟩= ⟨(A + i)C+φ, ψ⟩= ⟨C+φ, (A −i)ψ⟩. Since Ran(A −i) =
L2(X, dμ; H ), as shown above, C+φ = 0. Since C+ is injective, φ = 0.
Hence, D(A)⊥= {0}, implying that D(A) is dense.

Permutation Operators, Symmetric Tensor Products
and Anti-symmetric Tensor Products
As is well known in quantum mechanics, a system of identical quantum
particles may have symmetries with respect to their permutations. In this
section, we present some concepts to formulate such symmetries.
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
129
2.9.1
Permutation operators
Let H be a complex Hilbert space and σ ∈SN (N ∈N). Then, by Propo-
sition 2.4, there exists a unique unitary transformation Uσ on the N-fold
tensor product ⊗NH such that, for all Ψj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , N),
Uσ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj = ⊗N
j=1Ψσ(j).
(2.35)
We call Uσ the permutation operator with respect to σ ∈SN on ⊗NH .
Some of its elementary properties are given in the following proposition.
Proposition 2.9.
(i) For all σ, τ ∈SN,
UτUσ = Uστ.
(2.36)
(Note that the right-hand side is not Uτσ.)
(ii) For all σ ∈SN,
U −1
σ
= Uσ−1.
(2.37)
and
U ∗
σ = Uσ−1,
(2.38)
where U ∗
σ denotes the adjoint of Uσ.
Proof. (i) Let Ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N, and Φj := Ψσ(j). Then, by (2.35),
UτUσ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj = Uτ ⊗N
j=1 Φj = ⊗N
j=1Φτ(j) = ⊗N
j=1Ψ(στ)(j) = Uστ ⊗N
j=1 Ψj.
This implies that UτUσ = Uστ on span {⊗N
j=1Ψj|Ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N}, the
subspace algebraically spanned by the set {⊗N
j=1Ψj|Ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , N}.
This subspace is dense in ⊗NH . Hence, by Theorem 1.1, (2.36) holds.
(ii) Taking τ = σ−1 in (2.36), we have Uσ−1Uσ = I (the identity on H ).
We already know that Uσ is unitary. Hence, (2.37) follows. The unitarity
of Uσ implies that U ∗
σ = U −1
σ . Hence, (2.38) follows from (2.37).
□
To gain a deeper mathematical meaning of Proposition 2.9, we recall
some concepts from group theory.
2.9.2
Basic elements in group theory
A set G is called a semi-group if there exists a mapping G × G ∋(a, b) →
ab ∈G such that, for all a, b, c ∈G, (ab)c = a(bc) (composition law). The
mapping : (a, b) →ab is called the semi-group operation. If there exists
an element e ∈G such that, for all a ∈G, ae = ea = a, then G is said to
130
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
be unitary and e is called the unit element in G. It is easy to see that e
is unique.
If ab = ba for all a, b ∈G, then G is said to be commutative, or
Abelian.
A subset H of a semi-group G is called a subsemi-group of G if it is
a semi-group with respect to the semi-group operation of G.
A set G is called a group if it is a unitary semi-group with the following
additional property (the existence of inverse element): for each a ∈G, there
exists an element a−1 in G such that aa−1 = a−1a = e. The element a−1
is called the inverse element of a (it is easy to see that a−1 is uniquely
determined). For a group G, the operation : G × G ∋(a, b) →ab is called
the group operation of G.
Example 2.8. The set SN is a group with operation SN ×SN ∋(σ, τ) →
στ ∈SN (σ, τ ∈SN). This group is called the symmetry group of
order N. If N ≥3, then SN is non-commutative.
A subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if it is a group with the
group operation of G.
For each a ∈G and a subset F of G, the subsets aF and Fa of G are
deﬁned by aF := {af|f ∈F} and Fa := {fa|f ∈F}. Also, the subset aFb
(a, b ∈G) is deﬁned by aFb := {afb|f ∈F}.
A subgroup N of G is said to be normal if, for all a ∈G, aNa−1 = N.
For subsets G1, G2 of G, the subset G1G2 of G is deﬁned by
G1G2 := {ab|a ∈G1, b ∈G2}.
Let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then, it is easy to see that, for all
a, b ∈G,
(aN)(bN) = abN.
Hence, it follows that the set
G/N := {aN|a ∈G}
becomes a group with the product operation of subsets. The unit element
of G/N is N and the inverse element of aN is a−1N. This group is called
the residue class group modulo N, the quotient group by N, or the
factor group by N. A subset of the form aN (a ∈G) is called a coset
with respect to N.
Let G and H be groups. A mapping ρ : G →H is called a homomor-
phism if ρ(ab) = ρ(a)ρ(b), a, b ∈G.
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
131
Let ρ : G →H be a homomorphism and denote by eG (resp., eH) the
unit element of G (resp., H). Then, ρ(eG)ρ(eG) = ρ(e2
G) = ρ(eG). Hence,
ρ(eG) = eH.
Hence, the subset
N(ρ) := {g ∈G|ρ(g) = eH}
of G contains eG. The set N(ρ) is called the kernel of ρ.
It is easy to see that ρ is injective if and only if N(ρ) = {eG}.
The kernel N(ρ) is a normal subgroup.
A bijective homomorphism ρ : G →H is called an isomorphism. The
groups G and H are said to be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism
ρ : G →H. In this case, we write G
ρ∼
=H, or simply G ∼= H, if the isomor-
phism is understood. Two isomorphic groups can be regarded as identical
as groups.
It is not so diﬃcult to prove the following theorem, which is a basic one
in group theory.
Theorem 2.8 (Homomorphism theorem). Let ρ
:
G
→
H be a
homomorphism. Then, the mapping ˆρ : G/N(ρ) →ρ(G), deﬁned by
ˆρ(aN(ρ)) := ρ(a), a ∈G, is an isomorphism, i.e., G/N(ρ) ∼= ρ(G). In
particular, if ρ is surjective in addition, then G/N(ρ) ∼= H.
Let V be a vector space over K. Then, the set GL(V ) of bijective linear
mappings on V is a group with the product operation of mappings on V .
The group GL(V ) is called the general linear group on V .
A homomorphism ρ : G →GL(V ) is called a representation of G
on V . In this case, V is called the representation space of G. A repre-
sentation ρ of G on V is sometimes denoted (ρ, V ), or {ρ(g)|g ∈G}.
In the case where G is a topological space and V is ﬁnite dimensional,
ρ is said to be continuous if ρ(g) is continuous in g ∈G in the standard
topology of V .
If ρ is injective, then it is called a faithful representation of G.
A subspace M is called an invariant subspace of ρ if, for all g ∈G,
ρ(g)M ⊂M .
It follows that, for any invariant subspace M of ρ, ρ(g)M = M , g ∈G.
It is obvious that V and {0} ⊂V are invariant subspaces of ρ. But
these are called trivial invariant subspaces.
An invariant subspace M of ρ is said to be non-trivial if M ̸= {0}, V .
132
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A representation ρ : G →GL(V ) is said to be irreducible if it has no
non-trivial invariant subspace.
If V is a Hilbert space H and ρ(g) is unitary for all g ∈G, then ρ is
called a unitary representation of G on H .
In the case where G is a topological space, a unitary representation
ρ : G →GL(H ) is said to be strongly continuous if, for all Ψ ∈H , the
mapping : G ∋g →ρ(g)Ψ ∈H is continuous.
A group G is called a topological group if G is a topological space
and the mappings G × G ∋(g1, g2) →g1g2 ∈G and G ∋g →g−1 ∈G are
continuous.
Example 2.9. For each n ∈N, Rn is a commutative group with group
operation: Rn × Rn ∋(a, b) →a + b ∈Rn. The space Rn in this sense is
called the n-dimensional translation group. This is a topological group.
Let {U(t)}t∈R be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on a
Hilbert space H . Then, the mapping U : R →GL(H ); R ∋t →U(t) is
a strongly continuous unitary representation of R as the one-dimensional
translation group.
2.9.3
Unitary representation of SN
We now return to Proposition 2.9. One can deﬁne a mapping ρN : SN →
GL(⊗NH ) by
ρN(σ) := Uσ−1,
σ ∈SN.
Then, Proposition 2.9 implies that ρN(σ) is unitary and
ρN(στ) = ρN(σ)ρN(τ),
σ, τ ∈SN.
Hence, ρN is a unitary representation of the symmetry group SN on ⊗NH .
Thus, ⊗NH carries a unitary representation of SN.
2.9.4

where sgn(σ) denotes the sign of σ ∈SN: sgn(σ) = 1 if σ is an even
permutation and sgn(σ) = −1 if σ is an odd permutation. The operator
SN (resp., AN) is called the symmetrization operator (resp., anti-
symmetrization operator) on ⊗NH . The basic properties of these oper-
ators are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.9.
(i) For each σ ∈SN,
UσSN = SNUσ = SN,

UσAN = ANUσ = sgn(σ)AN.

(vii) For all N ≥2, SNAN = ANSN = 0, and Ran(SN) is orthogonal to
Ran(AN): Ran(SN) ⊥Ran(AN).
Proof. (i) We have by (2.39) and (2.36),
UσSN = 1
N!

τ∈SN
UσUτ = 1
N!

τ∈SN
Uτσ.
For each σ ∈SN, the mapping τ →τσ on SN is bijective. Hence, the
right-hand side is equal to SN. Similarly, one can show that SNUσ = SN.
To prove (2.42), we ﬁrst note that (2.40) and (2.36) imply
UσAN = 1
N!

τ∈SN
sgn(τ)Uτσ.
(2.44)
Using the well-known property
sgn(τσ) = sgn(τ)sgn(σ),
τ, σ ∈SN
and sgn(σ)2 = 1, one sees that sgn(τ) = sgn(τσ)sgn(σ). Hence, the right-
hand side of (2.44) is equal to sgn(σ)AN. Thus, (2.42) follows. Similarly,
one can show that ANUσ = sgn(σ)AN.

(iv) We have
SN(⊗N

(by (2.41)).
(v) Similar to the proof of (iv).
(vi) Let ψi = ψj (i ̸= j), and consider σ = (i, j) the transposition of
i and j. Then, sgn(σ) = −1. Hence, (2.43) implies that AN(⊗N
j=1ψj) =
−AN(⊗N
j=1ψj). Hence, AN(⊗N

If N ≥2, then

adjoint of both sides and using the self-adjointness of SN and AN (see (ii)
and (iii)), we have SNAN = 0.
□
Theorem 2.9(ii) and (iii) show that SN and AN are orthogonal projec-
tions. Since the range of an orthogonal projection is closed, the subspaces
⊗N
s H := Ran(SN)
(2.45)
and
∧N(H ) := Ran(AN)
(2.46)
are Hilbert spaces as closed subspaces of ⊗NH . The former is called the
N-fold symmetric tensor product of H and the latter is called the
N-fold anti-symmetric tensor product of H . Also, the symbol ⊗N
asH
or ∧NH may be used instead of ∧N(H ). We call an element of ⊗N
s H
(resp., ∧NH ) an N-fold symmetric (resp., anti-symmetric) tensor
on H .

(2.48)
Theorem 2.9(vii) is rewritten as

In application to quantum mechanics, ⊗N
s H (resp., ∧N(H )) is used
as the Hilbert space of state vectors of a quantum system of N identical
bosons3 (resp., fermions4), with H being the one-particle Hilbert space.

CONSs of ⊗N

We next show how the CONSs of ⊗N
s H and ∧N(H ) are made of the
CONSs of H .
We consider the case of ⊗N

deﬁne their product ψ1 . . . ψN ∈⊗N

By Theorem 2.9(iv), we have

Hence, the product operation is commutative.

{σ(n1 + 1), . . . , σ(n1 + n2)} = {n1 + 1, . . . , n1 + n2},

{σ(n1 + · · · + nr−1 + 1), . . . , σ(N)} = {n1 + · · · + nr−1 + 1, . . . , N}.
The number of these permutations is n1! · · · nr! and the value of the sum-

Proposition 2.10. Let {ej}∞

is a CONS of ⊗N
s H .
Proof. Let j1 ≤· · · ≤jN and k1 ≤· · · ≤kN (ji, ki ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N).
Then, by Lemma 2.7, we have

If {j1, . . . , jN} ̸= {k1, . . . , kN} in the sense of sets, then there is no σ ∈SN
such that j1 = kσ(1), . . . , jN = kσ(N). Hence, the right-hand side of the
above equation is zero. Therefore, ⟨ej1 · · · ejN , ek1 · · · ekN⟩= 0. This shows
that {Cj1···jN ej1 · · · ejN |j1 ≤· · · ≤jN, ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N} is an ONS
in ⊗N
s (H ). To prove the completeness of this ONS, let Ψ ∈⊗N
s H be
such that ⟨Ψ, ej1 · · · ejN⟩= 0, for all j1, . . . , jN ∈N, with j1 ≤· · · ≤jN.
For each set {k1, . . . , kN} with kj ∈N, there exists a σ ∈SN such that
kσ(1) ≤· · · ≤kσ(N). Hence,

Ψ, ekσ(1) · · · ekσ(N)

and (2.49), we have

Ψ, ekσ(1) · · · ekσ(N)

= ⟨Ψ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN⟩.
Hence, ⟨Ψ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN⟩= 0. Since {ek1 ⊗· · ·⊗ekN|ki ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N}
is a CONS of ⊗NH by Proposition 2.3(iv), it follows that Ψ = 0. Thus, the
ONS {Cj1···jN ej1 · · · ejN |j1 ≤· · · ≤jN, ji ∈N, i = 1, . . . , N} is complete. □

This shows that Cj1···jN is independent of the choice of CONS {ej}∞

CONSs of ∧N(H )
We next consider the case of ∧N(H ). For vectors ψ1, . . . , ψN ∈H , we
deﬁne the exterior product ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN ∈∧N(H ) by
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN :=
√
N!AN(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψN).
It follows from Theorem 2.9(v) that ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN is anti-symmetric with
respect to permutations of ψ1, . . . , ψN:
ψσ(1) ∧· · · ∧ψσ(N) = sgn(σ)ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN,
σ ∈SN.
(2.56)
This property has an important consequence, as follows.
Proposition 2.11. If there exists a pair (i, j) (i ̸= j) such that ψi = ψj,
then
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN = 0.
(2.57)
Proof. Applying (2.56) to the case σ = (i, j), the transposition of i and j,
and using the fact sgn(i, j) = −1, we have
ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN = −ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN.
Hence, (2.57) holds.
□
Remark 2.12. In the context of quantum mechanics, the fact stated in
Proposition 2.11 appears as the Pauli principle in the system of many
identical fermions.

□
Formula (2.59) is rewritten as follows:
⟨ψ1 ∧· · · ∧ψN, φ1 ∧· · · ∧φN⟩= det M(ψ, φ),
the determinant of the matrix M(ψ, φ) := (⟨ψj, φk⟩)j,k=1,...,N (the (j, k)th
component of M(ψ, φ) is ⟨ψj, φk⟩).
Proposition 2.12. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of H and N ≥2. Then, the
set
E (N)
as
:= {ei1 ∧· · · ∧eiN |i1 < i2 < · · · < iN, ij ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N}
(2.60)
is a CONS of ∧N(H ).
Proof. The orthonormality of the set given by (2.60) follows from Lemma
2.8. To prove its completeness, let Φ ∈∧N(H ) be such that, for all ij ∈N
(j = 1, . . . , N) with i1 < · · · < iN, ⟨Φ, ei1 ∧· · · ∧eiN ⟩= 0. By Theo-
rem 2.9(vi), this equation extends to all ij ∈N, with i1 ≤· · · ≤iN.
For each set {k1, . . . , kN} with kj ∈N, there is a σ ∈SN such that
kσ(1) ≤· · · ≤kσ(N). By (2.56), ek1 ∧· · · ∧ekN = sgn(σ)ekσ(1) ∧· · · ∧ekσ(N).
Hence, we have ⟨Φ, ek1 ∧· · · ∧ekN⟩= 0, for all kj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N.
However, by (2.58), the left-hand side is equal to
√
N! ⟨Φ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN⟩.
Hence, ⟨Φ, ek1 ⊗· · · ⊗ekN⟩= 0. Therefore, Φ = 0, implying the complete-
ness of the ONS given by (2.60).
□
Remark 2.13. If H is ﬁnite dimensional with dim H = d, then, for all
N > d, ∧N(H ) = {0} and, for 1 ≤N ≤d,

Occupation Number Representations
In this section, we formulate in an abstract framework the so-called
“occupation number representation” appearing in the quantum theory of
many-particle systems.
Let H be an inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert space and {ej}∞
j=1
be a CONS of H , as before. Physically, H here denotes a one-particle
Hilbert space.
2.10.1
The case of bosonic systems
Let E (N)
sym be the CONS of the symmetric tensor product Hilbert space
⊗N
s H given by (2.53). Then, by Remark 2.10, each element Ψj1...jN :=
Cj1···jN ej1 · · · ejN
in E (N)
sym
is uniquely determined by giving the list
(n1, n2, . . . , nj, . . .), with nj ∈Z+ being the number of times that ej appears
in Ψj1...jN and the condition 
j nj = N. Physically, nj means the number
of the bosons which occupy the state ej in the state Ψj1...jN and is hence
called the occupation number with respect to the state ej. Hence, each
element in E (N)
sym is written as
Ψ (N)
b
(n1, n2, . . .) :=

The case of fermionic systems
Each element Φj1...jN := ei1 ∧· · · ∧eiN of the CONS E (N)

is determined by giving the list (n1, n2, . . .), with nj ∈{0, 1} being the
number of times that ej appears in Φj1...jN and the condition 
j nj = N.
Physically, nj means the number of the fermions which occupy the state ej
in Φj1...jN
5, which is called the occupation number with respect to the
state ej. Therefore, each element in E (N)

is written as

Symmetric and Anti-Symmetric State Functions
in Quantum Mechanics
In this section, we describe elementary applications of the theory given in
the preceding sections to the theory of many-body quantum systems. A
typical one of such quantum systems is a system of N quantum particles
in a d-dimensional Euclidean vector space Rd, with N ≥2 and d ∈N. If
the quantum particles are of mutually diﬀerent kinds, then one can take
L2((Rd)N) = L2(RdN) as a Hilbert space of states for the system. We call
an element of L2(RdN) a state function of the system.
Remark 2.14. In most of the literature on quantum mechanics, a state
function is usually called a “wave function,” although there are exceptions
(e.g., Margenau and Murphy, 1943; Tomonaga, 1952). But it seems that the
5Note that, according to the Pauli principle (see Remark 2.12), the fermions which
occupy ej are at most one.
142
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
name “wave function” may be misleading in understanding properly the
essence of quantum mechanical state because, in the context of quantum
mechanics, an element ψ in L2(RdN) cannot be interpreted as representing
any physical wave, such as an electromagnetic wave. This is already sug-
gested by the fact that an element in L2(RdN) is an equivalence class, not a
function in the usual sense. As is well known, in the Hilbert space formal-
ism of quantum mechanics due to von Neumann (1932), ψ is interpreted
as a probability amplitude: for each Borel set Bj ⊂Rd (j = 1, . . . , N), the
integral

B1×···×BN |ψ(x)|2dx/∥ψ∥2 gives the probability of the event that
the jth particle is found in Bj, j = 1, . . . , N, where Rd is interpreted as the
position space of the quantum particles. The following points should also
be noted: (i) If N ≥2, RdN does not represent the physical (position) space
Rd (d = 1, 2, 3) in which quantum particles are supposed to exist. (ii) In
quantum mechanics, two state vectors ψ and αψ (α ∈C, α ̸= 1) represent
an identical quantum state; however, if ψ were to represent a physical wave,
then they would represent diﬀerent states because the amplitude of ψ is dif-
ferent from that of αψ. To be rigorous in the sense of natural philosophical
cognition, we do not use the word “wave function” for a quantum mechan-
ical state. Of course, from a purely mathematical point of view, it does not
matter which name is used.
For mathematical generality and usefulness for applications, we con-
sider a general measure space (X, Σ, μ) instead of (Rd, Bd, μd
L) (μd
L is the
Lebesgue measure on (Rd, Bd)). Let
XN := {x = (x1, . . . , xN)|xj ∈X, j = 1, . . . , N}
be the N-direct product of X. We denote by μN the N-product measure of
μ on XN. For each element ψ ∈L2(XN, dμN) and a permutation σ ∈SN,
one can deﬁne ψσ ∈L2(X, dμN) by
ψσ(x) := ψ(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(N)),
μN-a.e. x ∈XN.
Then, the mapping uσ : L2(XN, dμN) →L2(XN, dμN), deﬁned by
uσψ := ψσ,
ψ ∈L2(XN, dμN),
is unitary. For all σ, τ ∈SN,
(uσuτψ)(x) = (uτψ)(x′
1, . . . , x′
N)
(x′
j := xσ(j))
= ψ(x′
τ(1), . . . , x′
τ(N))
= ψ(xσ(τ(1)), . . . , xσ(τ(N)))
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
143
= ψ(x(στ)(1), . . . , x(στ)(N))
= (uστψ)(x).
Hence,
uσuτ = uστ,
σ, τ ∈SN.
Hence, in particular,
u∗
σ = u−1
σ
= uσ−1.
Therefore, the mapping ηN : SN →GL(L2(XN, dμN)), deﬁned by
ηN(σ) := uσ,
σ ∈SN,
is a unitary representation of SN.
2.11.1
The Hilbert space of symmetric state functions
A state function ψ ∈L2(XN, dμN) is said to be symmetric if, for each
σ ∈SN,
ψ(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(N)) = ψ(x), μN-a.e. x ∈XN.
This is equivalent to ψσ = ψ, for all σ ∈SN. We denote by L2
sym(XN, dμN)
the set of symmetric state functions in L2(XN, dμN):
L2
sym(XN, dμN) :=
'
ψ ∈L2(XN, dμN)|ψσ = ψ, σ ∈SN
(
.
Note that
Lsym(XN, dμN) = ∩σ∈SN ker(uσ −1).
This implies that Lsym(XN, dμN) is a closed subspace of L2(XN, dμN) and
hence a Hilbert space with the inner product of L2(XN, dμN). This Hilbert
space is used as a Hilbert space in the case where each quantum particle
under consideration is identical with a boson (i.e., a quantum particle with
an integer spin).6
We introduce a bounded linear operator

sN

the
orthogonal
projection
onto
Lsym(XN, dμN).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 2.9(ii), one can easily
show that sN is an orthogonal projection. Also, we have
uσsN = sN,
σ ∈SN,
which implies that Ran(sN) ⊂L2
sym(XN, dμN). By this fact and (2.65), we
have Ran(sN) = L2
sym(XN, dμN).
□
We call sN the symmetrization operator on L2(XN, dμN).
Let UX,N : ⊗NL2(X, dμ) →L2(XN, dμN) be the natural isomorphism
(Theorem 2.5), i.e., it is a unitary operator such that
UX,N ⊗N
j=1 fj = f1 × · · · × fN,
fj ∈L2(X, dμ), j = 1, . . . , N.
Then, an important fact is given in the following lemma.
Lemma 2.10. UX,NSN = sNUX,N.
Proof. For all fj ∈L2(X, dμ) (j = 1, . . . , N),
UX,NSN(⊗N
j=1fj) = 1
N!

σ∈SN
fσ(1) × · · · × fσ(N).
It is easy to see that
fσ(1) × · · · × fσ(N) = uσ−1(f1 × · · · × fN).
Hence,
UX,NSN(⊗N
j=1fj) = sN(f1 × · · · × fN) = sNUX,N(⊗N
j=1fj).
Therefore, UX,NSN = sNUX,N on ˆ⊗
NL2(X, dμ). Since ˆ⊗
NL2(X, dμ) is
dense in ⊗NL2(X, dμ) and both UX,NSN and sNUX,N are bounded, the
operator equality UX,NSN = sNUX,N follows (apply Theorem 1.1).
□
We denote by U sym
X,N the restriction of UX,N to ⊗N
s L2(X, dμ). For all
fj ∈L2(X, dμ) (j = 1, . . . , N), we have
U sym
X,N(f1 · · · fN) = sN(f1 × · · · × fN).
(2.66)
The following fact holds.
Theorem 2.10. The symmetric tensor product ⊗N
s L2(X, dμ) is isomorphic
to L2
sym(XN, dμN) under U sym
X,N.
Proof. Lemma 2.10 implies that Ran(U sym
X,N) = L2
sym(XN, dμN).

2.11.2
The Hilbert space of anti-symmetric state functions
A state function ψ ∈L2(XN, dμN) is said to be anti-symmetric if, for
each σ ∈SN,
ψ(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(N)) = sgn(σ)ψ(x), μN-a.e. x ∈XN.
This is equivalent to ψσ = sgn(σ)ψ, for all σ ∈SN. We denote by
L2
as(XN, dμN) the set of anti-symmetric state functions in L2(XN, dμN):
L2
as(XN, dμN) :=
'
ψ ∈L2(XN, dμN) | ψσ = sgn(σ)ψ, σ ∈SN
(
.
We have
L2
as(XN, dμN) = ∩σ∈SN ker(uσ −sgn(σ)).
Hence, L2
as(XN, dμN) is a closed subspace of L2(XN, dμN). Therefore,
L2
as(XN, dμN) is a Hilbert space with the inner product of L2(XN, dμN).
This Hilbert space is used as a Hilbert space in the case where each quan-
tum particle under consideration is identical with a fermion (i.e., a quantum
particle with a half-integer spin).7

aN := 1

σ∈SN
sgn(σ)uσ
on L2(XN, dμN) satisﬁes
aNψ = ψ,
ψ ∈L2

It is easy to see that
uσaN = sgn(σ)aN,
σ ∈SN.

Tensor Product of Direct Sum Hilbert Spaces
Let Hj (j

= 1, . . . , M) be Hilbert spaces
(N, M ∈N). Then, for each pair (j, k), one has the tensor product Hilbert
space Hj ⊗Kk. Hence, the direct sum of these Hilbert spaces exists. We
denote it by ⊕N
j=1 ⊕M
k=1 Hj ⊗Kk. Each element F in ⊕N
j=1 ⊕M
k=1 Hj ⊗Kk
can be represented as an N × M matrix F = (Fjk)j=1,...,N,k=1,...,M, with
the (j, k)th component Fjk being an element of Hj ⊗Kk.

for all lj = 1, . . . , Nj. Hence, ψj = 0, j = 1, . . . , N. Therefore, ψ = 0. Thus,
the desired result follows.
□
In applications to quantum physics, the tensor product of direct sums
of Hilbert spaces appears. To handle it, the following theorem is useful.
Theorem 2.12. Let K be a Hilbert space. Then:
(i) There exists a unique unitary transformation U : (⊕N
j=1Hj) ⊗K →
⊕N
j=1Hj ⊗K such that, for all ψ ∈⊕N
j=1Hj and φ ∈K ,
Uψ ⊗φ = (ψ1 ⊗φ, . . . , ψN ⊗φ).
(2.69)
(ii) There exists a unique unitary transformation V
:

j=1 ⊕M

j=1Hj
and φ ∈⊕M
k=1Kk,
Uψ ⊗φ = (ψj ⊗φk)1≤j≤N,1≤k≤M.
Proof. (i) Let e(j)
lj
be as in Lemma 2.13 and {fk}K
k=1 (1 ≤K ≤∞) be a
CONS of K . Then, for each j, {e(j)
lj ⊗fk|lj = 1, . . . , Nj, k = 1, . . . , K} is a
CONS of Hj ⊗K . Hence, by Lemma 2.13, the vectors
Φ(j)
lj,k := (0, . . . , 0,
jth

form a CONS {Φ(j)
lj,k|j

⊕N
j=1Hj ⊗K .
By Lemma 2.13 again, {e(j)

k = 1, . . . , K} is a CONS of (⊕N

By (i) again,

Notes
A natural extension of the concept of tensor product of ﬁnitely many Hilbert
spaces is the concept of an inﬁnite tensor product Hilbert space,
⊗∞
n=1Hn, constructed from a sequence {Hn}∞
n=1 of Hilbert spaces. It is
a non-trivial task to deﬁne it rigorously, however. For details, see the orig-
inal paper by von Neumann (1939) or Ezawa (1978). A use of inﬁnite ten-
sor product Hilbert space in quantum mathematical physics is found, for
example, in the works of Thirring and Wehrl (1967) and Ezawa (1978). But,
nowadays, inﬁnite tensor product Hilbert spaces are not so often used, at
least in the ﬁeld of quantum mathematical physics.

Problems
In the following problems, H , K , Hj and Kj (j ∈N) are Hilbert spaces.
(1) Let V be a complex vector space with a positive semi-deﬁnite inner
product ⟨, ⟩.
(i) Prove that the subset V0 := {u ∈V | ⟨u, u⟩= 0} is a subspace
of V .
Tensor Product Hilbert Spaces
149
▶Hint. For any positive semi-deﬁnite inner product, the Schwarz
inequality holds: | ⟨u, v⟩| ≤

⟨u, u⟩

⟨v, v⟩, u, v ∈V .
(ii) For two vectors u, v ∈V , deﬁne the relation u ∼v by u −v ∈V0.
Prove that this relation ∼is an equivalence relation.
(iii) For each u ∈V , denote its equivalence class by [u]: [u] := {v ∈
V |v ∼u}, and let V /V0 := {[u]|u ∈V } (the quotient space of
V by V0). Then, V /V0 is a complex vector space with the following
addition and scalar multiplication: [u]+[v] := [u+v], α[u] = [αu],
u, v ∈V , α ∈C.
(iv) For [u], [v] ∈V /V0, deﬁne ⟨[u], [v]⟩:= ⟨u, v⟩. Prove that this is
well deﬁned (i.e., it is independent of the choice of elements from
[u] and [v]) and yields an inner product of V /V0.
Remark. The completion V /V0 of the inner product space V /V0 gives a
Hilbert space. The Hilbert space V /V0 is called the Hilbert space associated
with the positive semi-deﬁnite inner product space V . Thus, there is a
correspondence from the set of positive semi-deﬁnite inner product spaces
to the set of Hilbert spaces.
(2) Let F : H × H →K be a bilinear form on a Hilbert space H over K
such that, for some constant C > 0, |F(φ, ψ)∥≤C∥φ∥∥ψ∥, φ, ψ ∈H .
(i) Consider the case of K = R. Then, there exists a unique bounded
linear operator T ∈B(H ) such that F(φ, ψ) = ⟨T φ, ψ⟩, φ, ψ ∈
H and ∥T ∥≤C.
(ii) Consider the case of K = C. Then, there exists a unique bounded
anti-linear operator T on H such that D(T ) = H and F(φ, ψ) =
⟨T φ, ψ⟩, φ, ψ ∈H , ∥T ∥≤C.
(3) Prove that (H1 ⊗H2) ⊗H3 ∼= H1 ⊗H2 ⊗H3, with correspondence
(Ψ1 ⊗Ψ2) ⊗Ψ3 →Ψ1 ⊗Ψ2 ⊗Ψ3 (Ψi ∈Hi, i = 1, 2, 3)
(4) Prove that, for all n ≥
3, (⊗n−1
i=1 Hi) ⊗Hn

j=1Hj, with
correspondence (⊗n−1
i=1 Ψi) ⊗Ψn →⊗n

correspondence (Ψ1, Ψ2) ⊗Φ →(Ψ1 ⊗Φ, Ψ2 ⊗Φ) (Ψ1 ∈H1, Ψ2 ∈H2,
Φ ∈K ).

Φj = 0, j = 1, . . . , n.
(8) Let (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space. Prove that the inner product space
L2(X, dμ; H ) is complete.
(9) Let m, n ∈N and Cmn := {ξ = (ξjk)j=1,...,m,k=1,...,n|ξjk ∈C,
j

w = (w1, . . . , wn) ∈Cn, we deﬁne z ◦w ∈Cmn by z ◦w :=
(zjwk)j=1,...,m,k=1,...,n. Prove that there exists a unique unitary trans-
formation Umn : Cm ⊗Cn →Cmn such that Umn(z ⊗w) = z ◦w,
z ∈Cm, w ∈Cn.
Remark. This problem shows that Cm ⊗Cn is isomorphic to Cmn under
the unitary transformation Umn. This isomorphism is called the natural
isomorphism between Cm ⊗Cn and Cmn. In this sense, one writes Cm ⊗
Cn ∼= Cmn.

a(N) ∈ℓ2(SN) by
(a(1) ◦· · · ◦a(N))i1···iN := a(1)
i1 · · · a(N)
iN ,

Prove that there exists a unique unitary transformation US

Tensor Product of
Linear Operators
For each set, (A1, . . . , AN), of densely deﬁned closable linear operators Aj
(j = 1, . . . , N) acting in a Hilbert space, Hj, respectively, a linear operator
⊗N
j=1Aj, called the
tensor product operator, (or
tensor product), of Ajs, is
deﬁned. The fundamental properties of tensor product operators are proven. In
particular, detailed analyses are made on tensor products of self-adjoint operators,
which play important roles in applications to the theory of many-body quantum
systems.
3.1
Algebraic Tensor Product of Linear Operators
In the rest of this book, we mean by “Hilbert space” a “complex Hilbert
space,” unless otherwise stated.
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces, and A and B be linear operators on
H and K with domains D(A) and D(B), respectively. Then, the algebraic
tensor product D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) is a natural subspace of the tensor product
Hilbert space H ⊗K associated with the pair (A, B). The following fact
is harmonious.
Lemma 3.1. There exists a unique linear operator Aˆ⊗B on H ⊗K , with
D(Aˆ⊗B) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B), such that
Aˆ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ) = AΨ ⊗BΦ,
Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B).
(3.1)
Proof. Existence. Let F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗D(B). Then, there exist an n ∈N and
vectors Ψi ∈D(A), Φi ∈D(B) (i = 1, . . . , n) such that
F =
n

i=1
Ψi ⊗Φi.
(3.2)
153

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We may deﬁne a mapping Aˆ⊗B : D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) →H ⊗K by
Aˆ⊗B(F) :=
n

i=1
AΨi ⊗BΦi.
(3.3)
To show that this is well-deﬁned, we have to prove that the right-hand side
of (3.3) is independent of the ways of representing F as in (3.2). So, let
F =
m

j=1
Ψ ′

j
(3.4)
be another representation of F, with some m ∈N, Ψ ′
j ∈D(A) and Φ′
j ∈
D(B) (j = 1, . . . , m). Then, the subspaces MA := span {Ψi, Ψ ′
j|i = 1, . . . , n,
j = 1, . . . , m} and MB := span {Φi, Φ′
j|i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m} are ﬁnite
dimensional. Let dA := dim MA and dB := dim MB, and {ηk}dA
k=1 and
{θl}dB
l=1 be orthonormal bases of MA and MB, respectively. Then, we have
the following expansions:

Thus, Aˆ⊗B is well deﬁned. It is easy to see that Aˆ⊗B is linear and (3.1)
holds.
Tensor Product of Linear Operators

Uniqueness. Suppose that there exists a linear operator T on H ⊗K , with
D(T ) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B), such that T (Ψ ⊗Φ) = AΨ ⊗BΦ, Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B).
Then, T (Ψ ⊗Φ) = Aˆ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ), Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B). It follows from the
linearity of T and Aˆ⊗B that, for all F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗D(B), T (F) = Aˆ⊗B(F).
Thus, T = Aˆ⊗B.
□
We call the operator Aˆ⊗B the algebraic tensor product of A and B.
Remark 3.1. Let H ′ and K ′ be Hilbert spaces and A (resp., B) be a
linear operator from H (resp., K ) to H ′ (resp., K ′). Then, in quite the
same manner as above, one can prove that there exists a unique linear
operator A⊗B from H ⊗K to H ′ ⊗K ′ such that, for all Ψ ∈D(A) and
Φ ∈D(B), A⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ) = AΨ ⊗BΦ. The operator A⊗B also is called the
algebraic tensor product of A and B. This concept of algebraic tensor
product of two linear operators is more general.
3.2
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
Let A ∈L(H ) and B ∈L(K ).
Lemma 3.2. Suppose that A and B are densely deﬁned and closable. Then,
Aˆ⊗B is densely deﬁned and closable. Moreover,
A∗ˆ⊗B∗⊂(Aˆ⊗B)∗,
(3.5)
Aˆ⊗B = Aˆ⊗B.
(3.6)
Proof. It is obvious that Aˆ⊗B is densely deﬁned. Hence, the adjoint
(Aˆ⊗B)∗exists. It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(A), Φ ∈D(B), Ψ ′ ∈
D(A∗) and Φ′ ∈D(B∗),
⟨Ψ ′ ⊗Φ′, AΨ ⊗BΦ⟩= ⟨A∗Ψ ′ ⊗B∗Φ′, Ψ ⊗Φ⟩.
Hence, it follows that, for all F ∈D(Aˆ⊗B) and G ∈D(A∗ˆ⊗B∗),

G, Aˆ⊗B(F)

=

A∗ˆ⊗B∗G, F

.
This implies that G ∈D((Aˆ⊗B)∗) and (Aˆ⊗B)∗G = A∗ˆ⊗B∗G. Hence, (3.5)
holds.
By Proposition 1.8, D(A∗) and D(B∗) are dense. Hence, D(A∗ˆ⊗B∗) is
dense. Therefore, by (3.5), D((Aˆ⊗B)∗) is dense. Thus, by Proposition 1.8
156
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
again, Aˆ⊗B is closable. It is obvious that
Aˆ⊗B ⊂Aˆ⊗B.
Hence, by (1.11),
Aˆ⊗B ⊂Aˆ⊗B.
(3.7)
To prove the converse relation, let F ∈D(A ˆ⊗B). Then, F is written as
F = 
i Ψi ⊗Φi, with Ψi ∈D(A) and Φi ∈D(B) (the sum is over a ﬁnite
number of terms). By the deﬁnition of operator closure, there exist vectors
Ψi,n ∈D(A), Φi,n ∈D(B) (n ∈N) such that Ψi,n →Ψi, Φi,n →Φi, AΨi,n →
AΨi and BΦi,n →BΦi as n →∞. Hence, letting Fn := 
i Ψi,n ⊗Φi,n,
we have Fn ∈D(Aˆ⊗B), Fn →F and Aˆ⊗BFn →Aˆ⊗BF as n →∞. This
means that F ∈D(Aˆ⊗B) and Aˆ⊗BF = Aˆ⊗BF. Hence, Aˆ⊗B ⊂Aˆ⊗B.
By this relation and (1.11), we obtain the converse relation of (3.7). Thus,
(3.6) holds.
□
By Lemma 3.2, the following deﬁnition is possible.
Deﬁnition 3.1. For densely deﬁned closable operators A and B on H and
K , respectively, the closed operator
A ⊗B := Aˆ⊗B
(3.8)
on H ⊗K is called the tensor product operator, (or the tensor prod-
uct), of A and B.
Remark 3.2. Also, in the case where A (resp., B) is a densely deﬁned
closable operator from H (resp., K ) to a Hilbert space H ′ (resp., K ′),
A ⊗B is deﬁned by (3.8) as a closed operator from H ⊗K to H ′ ⊗K ′
(see Remark 3.1).
Let A ∈L(H ) and B ∈L(K ) be densely deﬁned and closable. Then,
by Lemma 3.2, we have
A ⊗B = A ⊗B.
(3.9)
It is easy to see that, for all α ∈C,
α(A ⊗B) = (αA) ⊗B = A ⊗(αB).
It follows from the deﬁnition of A ⊗B that D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) is a core for
A ⊗B. The following proposition formulates basic facts on A ⊗B.
Proposition 3.1. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K , respectively. Then:
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
157
(i) If D ⊂D(A) and F ⊂D(B) are cores for A and B, respectively, then
D ˆ⊗F is a core for A ⊗B.
(ii) A∗⊗B∗⊂(A ⊗B)∗.
(iii) If A and B are symmetric, then A ⊗B is symmetric.
(iv) Ran(A ⊗B) = Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B).
Proof. (i) Let T := (A ⊗B) ↾D ˆ⊗F. Then, it is obvious that T ⊂A ⊗B.
Hence, T ⊂A ⊗B. To prove the converse relation, let Ψ ∈D(A) and Φ ∈
D(B). Then, there exist sequences {Ψn}∞
n=1, with Ψn ∈D, and {Φn}∞
n=1,
with Φn ∈F, such that Ψn →Ψ, AΨn →AΨ, Φn →Φ and BΦn →BΦ
as n →∞. Hence, Ψn ⊗Φn →Ψ ⊗Φ and T (Ψn ⊗Φn) →Aˆ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ)
as n →∞. This means that Aˆ⊗B ⊂T. Hence, A ⊗B ⊂T. Therefore,
T = A ⊗B.
(ii) Taking the closure operation on (3.5), we have A∗⊗B∗⊂(Aˆ⊗B)∗.
By Proposition 1.8(ii), (Aˆ⊗B)∗=

Aˆ⊗B
∗
= (A⊗B)∗, Hence, A∗⊗B∗⊂
(A ⊗B)∗.
(iii) Since A ⊂A∗and B ⊂B∗, it follows that Aˆ⊗B ⊂A∗ˆ⊗B∗. Hence,
taking the closure operation, we have A⊗B ⊂A∗⊗B∗. Using part (ii), we
obtain A ⊗B ⊂(A ⊗B)∗. Thus, A ⊗B is symmetric.
(iv) It is obvious that Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B)
⊂
Ran(A ⊗B). Hence,
Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B) ⊂Ran(A ⊗B). To prove the converse inclusion relation,
let Ψ ∈Ran(A ⊗B). Then, there exists a vector Φ ∈D(A ⊗B) such
that Ψ = (A ⊗B)Φ. By the deﬁnition of A ⊗B, there exists a sequence
{Φn}∞
n=1 in D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) such that Φn →Φ and (A⊗B)Φn →(A⊗B)Φ = Ψ
(n →∞). It is easy to see that (A⊗B)Φn is in Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B). Hence, Ψ ∈
Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B). Therefore, Ran(A⊗B) ⊂Ran(Aˆ⊗Ran(B), implying that
Ran(A ⊗B) ⊂Ran(Aˆ⊗Ran(B). Hence, Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B) = Ran(A ⊗B).
By Proposition 2.2, the left-hand side is equal to Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B).
□
Remark 3.3. In Proposition 3.1(ii), the following equality holds: A∗⊗
B∗= (A ⊗B)∗. For a proof of this fact, see, for example, Schm¨udgen
(2012), Proposition 7.26.
In applications, operators of the form A ⊗I + I ⊗B, with A and B
being densely deﬁned closable operators, are also fundamental.
Proposition 3.2. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K , respectively. Let
S(A, B) := A ⊗I + I ⊗B,
S0(A, B) := S ↾D(A)ˆ⊗D(B).
158
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then:
(i) S(A, B) and S0(A, B) are densely deﬁned, closable and
S(A∗, B∗) ⊂S(A, B)∗,
(3.10)
S0(A∗, B∗) ⊂S0(A, B)∗.
(3.11)
(ii) If D ⊂D(A) and F ⊂D(B) are cores for A and B, respectively, then
D ˆ⊗F is a core for S0(A, B). In particular,
S0(A, B) = S0(A, B).
(3.12)
(iii) If A and B are symmetric, then S(A, B) and S0(A, B) are symmetric.
Proof. (i) It is obvious that D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) ⊂D(S(A, B)). Hence, S(A, B)
is densely deﬁned and S(A, B)∗⊃(A⊗I)∗+ (I ⊗B)∗⊃S(A∗, B∗). Hence,
D(S(A, B)∗) is dense, and (3.10) holds. Thus, S(A, B) is closable.
Since D(S0(A, B)) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B) is dense in H ⊗K , S0(A, B) is
densely deﬁned. It is obvious that S0(A, B) ⊂S(A, B) ⊂S(A, B). Hence,
S0(A, B) is closable. By direct computations, one can show that, for all Ψ ∈
D(S0(A∗, B∗)) = D(A∗)ˆ⊗D(B∗) and Φ ∈D(S0(A, B)) = D(A)ˆ⊗D(B),
⟨Ψ, S0(A, B)Φ⟩= ⟨(A∗⊗I + I ⊗B∗)Ψ, Φ⟩= ⟨S0(A∗, B∗)Ψ, Φ⟩. Hence, Ψ ∈
D(S0(A, B)∗) and S0(A, B)∗Ψ = S0(A∗, B∗)Ψ. Hence, (3.11) holds.
(ii) Let S00 := S0(A, B) ↾D ˆ⊗F. Then, S00 ⊂S0(A, B), and hence
S00 ⊂S0(A, B). In the same way as in the proof of Proposition 3.1(i),
one can show that S0(A, B) ⊂S00. Hence, S0(A, B) ⊂S00. Therefore,
S00 = S0(A, B). Thus, D ˆ⊗F is a core for S0(A, B). Formula (3.12) is
proved by an application of the preceding result to the case where A and
B are replaced by A and B, respectively, and D = D(A), F = D(B).
(iii) Under the present assumption, S(A, B)
⊂
S(A∗, B∗) and
S0(A, B) ⊂S0(A∗.B∗). These relations and (i) imply that S(A, B) and
S0(A, B) are symmetric.
□
We conclude this section with a theorem on the unitary equivalence of
tensor product operators.
Theorem 3.1. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K , respectively. Let U : H ⊗K →K ⊗H be the natural isomorphism
(see Proposition 2.4), i.e., U is the unitary transformation from H ⊗K to
K ⊗H such that, for all Ψ ∈H and Φ ∈K , U(Ψ ⊗Φ) = Φ ⊗Ψ. Then,
U(A ⊗B)U −1 = B ⊗A.
(3.13)
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
159
Proof. It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(A) and Φ ∈D(B),
U(A ⊗B)U −1Φ ⊗Ψ = (B ⊗A)Φ ⊗Ψ.
Hence, U(A ⊗B)U −1 = B ⊗A on D(B)ˆ⊗D(A). This fact and a simple
limiting argument give that U(A⊗B)U −1 ⊂B ⊗A. By symmetry, we have
U −1(B ⊗A)U ⊂A ⊗B, which implies that B ⊗A ⊂U(A ⊗B)U −1. Thus,
(3.13) holds.
□
Formula (3.13) shows that A ⊗B is unitarily equivalent to B ⊗A under
the natural isomorphism U. This is a nice property. For example, the spec-
tral properties of B ⊗A are similar to those of A ⊗B. Moreover, (3.13)
makes it possible to derive the properties of B ⊗A from those of A ⊗B.
3.3
Tensor Product of Bounded Linear Operators
In this section, as a basic step for analysis of tensor product operators, we
consider the tensor products of bounded linear operators.
For a Hilbert space X , we denote the identity on X by IX (or simply
I if there would be no danger of confusion).
Theorem 3.2. Let A ∈B(H ) and B ∈B(K ).
(i) A ⊗I and I ⊗B are in B(H ⊗K ), with
∥A ⊗I∥= ∥A∥,
∥I ⊗B∥= ∥B∥.
(3.14)
(ii) A ⊗B ∈B(H ⊗K ) and
A ⊗B = (A ⊗I)(I ⊗B) = (I ⊗B)(A ⊗I).
(3.15)
In particular, A ⊗I and I ⊗B commute.
Moreover,
∥A ⊗B∥= ∥A∥∥B∥.
(3.16)
(iii) For all C ∈B(H ) and D ∈B(K ),
(A ⊗B)(C ⊗D) = (AC) ⊗(BD),
(3.17)
(A + C) ⊗(B + D) = A ⊗B + A ⊗D + C ⊗B + C ⊗D.
(3.18)
(iv) A∗⊗B∗= (A ⊗B)∗.
(v) If A and B are self-adjoint, then A ⊗B and A ⊗I + I ⊗B are self-
adjoint.
160
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(vi) If A and B are unitary, then A ⊗B is unitary.
(vii) If A and B are orthogonal projections, A⊗B is an orthogonal projec-
tion and Ran(A ⊗B) = Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B).
Proof. (i) Let F ∈H ˆ⊗K . Then, by Lemma 2.1, F is written as F =
M
l=1 Ψl ⊗fl (see (2.12)), with Ψl ∈H and {fl}l being an ONS of K .
Hence,
∥(Aˆ⊗I)F∥2 =
					
M

l=1
AΨl ⊗fl
					
2
=
M

l=1
∥AΨl∥2
≤∥A∥2
M

l=1
∥Ψl∥2 = ∥A∥2∥F∥2.
Hence, Aˆ⊗I is bounded with ∥Aˆ⊗I∥≤∥A∥. Since H ˆ⊗K is dense in
H ⊗K , A ⊗I is in B(H ⊗K ), with ∥A ⊗I∥≤∥A∥.
There exists a sequence {Θn}∞
n=1 of unit vectors Θn ∈H such that
∥AΘn∥→∥A∥as n →∞. Then, for all unit vectors Φ ∈K ,
∥AΘn∥= ∥A ⊗I(Θn ⊗Φ)∥≤∥A ⊗I∥∥Θn ⊗Φ∥= ∥A ⊗I∥.
Hence, taking n →∞, we obtain ∥A∥≤∥A ⊗I∥. Thus, the ﬁrst equation
of (3.14) holds. The statements for I ⊗B can be similarly proved.
(ii) It is easy to see that, for all F ∈H ˆ⊗K , A⊗B(F) = (A⊗I)(I⊗B)F.
Hence, A ⊗B ↾H ˆ⊗K ⊂(A ⊗I)(I ⊗B). Therefore, A ⊗B is bounded,
and A ⊗B = (A ⊗I)(I ⊗B). Similarly, we have A ⊗B = (I ⊗B)(A ⊗I).
By part (i), we have ∥A⊗B∥≤∥A⊗I∥∥I ⊗B∥= ∥A∥∥B∥. Let us prove
the converse inequality. By the deﬁnition of operator norm, for any ε > 0,
there exist unit vectors Ψ ∈H and Φ ∈K satisfying ∥AΨ∥> ∥A∥−ε and
∥BΦ∥> ∥B∥−ε. We have
∥A ⊗B∥≥∥A ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ)∥= ∥AΨ∥∥BΦ∥.
Hence,
∥A ⊗B∥> (∥A∥−ε)(∥B∥−ε).
Taking ε →0, we obtain ∥A ⊗B∥≥∥A∥∥B∥. Thus, (3.16) holds.
(iii) For all F ∈H ˆ⊗K , (A ⊗B)(C ⊗D)F = (AC) ⊗(BD)F. Since
(A ⊗B)(C ⊗D) and (AC) ⊗(BD) are bounded, (3.17) follows. Similarly,
(3.18) can be proved.
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
161
(iv) This follows from Proposition 3.1(ii) and the fact that A∗⊗B∗∈
B(H ⊗K ) in the present case.
(v) If A ∈B(H ) and B ∈B(K ) are self-adjoint, then A∗= A and
B∗= B. Hence, by part (iv), A ⊗B = (A ⊗B)∗. Hence, A ⊗B is self-
adjoint. In particular, A⊗I and I ⊗B are self-adjoint and bounded. Hence,
A ⊗I + I ⊗B is also a bounded self-adjoint operator.
(vi) By the present assumption, A∗A = AA∗= I and B∗B = BB∗= I.
Hence, by (iv) and (iii),
(A⊗B)∗(A⊗B) = A∗A⊗B∗B = I,
(A⊗B)(A⊗B)∗= AA∗⊗BB∗= I.
This means that A ⊗B is unitary.
(vii) The self-adjointness of A ⊗B follows from (v). By (3.17), (A ⊗
B)2 = A2 ⊗B2 = A ⊗B. Hence, A ⊗B is an orthogonal projection. It
is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B), (A ⊗B)Ψ = Ψ. Hence,
Ran(A)ˆ⊗Ran(B) ⊂Ran(A⊗B). Taking the closure of both sides, we obtain
Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B) ⊂Ran(A ⊗B). Conversely, let Ψ ∈Ran(A ⊗B). Then,
(A ⊗B)Ψ = Ψ. There exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in H ⊗K such that
Ψn →Ψ (n →∞). The vector Φn := (A⊗B)Ψn is in Ran(A)⊗Ran(B) and
Φn →(A⊗B)Ψ = Ψ. Hence, Ψ ∈Ran(A)⊗Ran(B). Hence, Ran(A⊗B) ⊂
Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B). Thus, Ran(A ⊗B) = Ran(A) ⊗Ran(B).
□
The following proposition is concerned with the convergence properties
of sequences of tensor product operators.
Proposition 3.3. Let An, A ∈B(H ) and Bn, B ∈B(K ) (n ∈N).
(i) If u- limn→∞An = A and u- limn→∞Bn = B, then u- limn→∞An ⊗
Bn = A ⊗B.
(ii) If s-limn→∞An = A and s- limn→∞Bn = B, then s- limn→∞An ⊗
Bn = A ⊗B.
(iii) If w-limn→∞An = A and w- limn→∞Bn = B, then w- limn→∞An ⊗
Bn = A ⊗B.
Proof. (i) This is proved as follows:
∥An ⊗Bn −A ⊗B∥= ∥(An −A) ⊗Bn + A ⊗(Bn −B)∥
≤∥(An −A) ⊗Bn∥+ ∥A ⊗(Bn −B)∥
= ∥An −A∥∥Bn∥+ ∥A∥∥Bn −B∥
(by (3.16))

(n →∞).
162
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) For all Ψ, Φ ∈H , limn→∞AnΨ
= AΨ and limn→∞BnΦ =
BΦ. Hence, by Proposition 2.1(i), limn→∞An ⊗Bn(Ψ ⊗Φ) = A⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ).
This implies that, for all F ∈H ˆ⊗K , limn→∞An ⊗Bn(F) = A ⊗B(F).
By Proposition 1.13, a := supn∈N ∥An∥< ∞and b := supn∈N ∥Bn∥< ∞.
Hence, supn∈N ∥An ⊗Bn∥≤ab. Hence, by an application of Proposition
A.3 in Appendix A, we obtain s- limn→∞An ⊗Bn = A ⊗B.
(iii) In the same way as in (ii), we can show that, for all F, G ∈H ˆ⊗K ,
limn→∞⟨F, An ⊗Bn(G)⟩= ⟨F, A ⊗B(G)⟩. By Proposition 1.13, ∥An ⊗
Bn∥= ∥An∥∥Bn∥≤ab, n ∈N. Hence, by Proposition A.2 in Appendix A,
the desired result is obtained.
□
3.4
Reduction of Tensor Product Operators
In this section, we prove some basic facts on the reductions of tensor product
operators (see Section 1.9 for the concept of reduction of a linear operator).
Proposition 3.4. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on
H and K , respectively. Suppose that A (resp., B) is reduced by a closed
subspace M ⊂H (resp., N ⊂K ).
(i) The operator A ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N , and
(A ⊗B)M⊗N = AM ⊗BN .
(3.19)
(ii) The operator A ⊗I + I ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N , and
(A ⊗I + I ⊗B)M⊗N = AM ⊗IN + IM ⊗BN .
(3.20)
Proof. Let P (resp., Q) be the orthogonal projection onto M (resp., N ).
Then, by the assumption, PA ⊂AP · · · (∗) and QB ⊂BQ · · · (∗∗). By
Theorem 3.2(vii), the orthogonal projection onto M ⊗N is P ⊗Q.
(i) Let Ψ ∈D(A ⊗B). Then, there exists a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=1 in
D(A)⊗D(B) such that Ψn →Ψ and (A⊗B)Ψn →(A⊗B)Ψ (n →∞). By (∗)
and (∗∗) mentioned above, we have (P ⊗Q)(A⊗B)Ψn = (A⊗B)(P ⊗Q)Ψn.
Hence, (A ⊗B)(P ⊗Q)Ψn
→(P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψ (n →∞). Also,
(P ⊗Q)Ψn →(P ⊗Q)Ψ (n →∞). Since A ⊗B is closed, it follows that
(P ⊗Q)Ψ ∈D(A ⊗B) and (A ⊗B)(P ⊗Q)Ψ = (P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψ. Hence,
(A ⊗B)(P ⊗Q) ⊂(P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B). Thus, A ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N .
It is obvious that (A ⊗B)M⊗N = AM ⊗BN on D(AM )⊗D(BN ).
Hence, it follows that AM ⊗BM ⊂(A ⊗B)M⊗N .
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
163
Conversely, let Ψ ∈D((A ⊗B)M⊗N ). Then, there exists a sequence
{Φn}∞
n=1 in D(A⊗B) such that Φn →Ψ and (A ⊗B)Φn →(A ⊗B)Ψ
(n →∞). Hence, letting Ψn := (P ⊗Q)Φn, we have Ψn ∈D(AM )⊗D(BN )
and limn→∞Ψn = (P ⊗Q)Ψ = Ψ. Moreover, (AM ⊗BN )Ψn = (P ⊗
Q)(A ⊗B)Φn →(P ⊗Q)(A ⊗B)Ψ = (A ⊗B)M⊗N Ψ (n →∞). Hence,
Ψ ∈D(AM ⊗BN ) and (AM ⊗BN )Ψ = (A ⊗B)M⊗N Ψ. Thus, (3.19)
holds.
(ii) By a simple application of (i), A ⊗I and I ⊗B are reduced by
M ⊗N , with (A ⊗I)M⊗N = AM ⊗IN and (I ⊗B)M⊗N = IM ⊗BN .
Hence, by Proposition 1.53, A ⊗I + I ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N . Hence,
by Theorem 1.47(v), A ⊗I + I ⊗B is reduced by M ⊗N and

A ⊗I + I ⊗B

M⊗N = (A ⊗I + I ⊗B)M⊗N .
By Proposition 1.53 and the above mentioned facts, one obtains (3.20). □
3.5
Basic Properties of Simple Tensor Product Operators
Let A be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H or K . Then, the corre-
spondence A →A⊗I, or I ⊗A, gives an extension of A to a closed operator
on H ⊗K . We show that some properties of A are preserved under these
extensions. By Theorem 3.1, U(A ⊗I)U −1 = I ⊗A, where U is the natural
isomorphism from H ⊗K to K ⊗H . Hence, the properties of I ⊗A can
be derived from those of A ⊗I.1 Therefore it is suﬃcient to consider A ⊗I.
Remark 3.4. Let H1, . . . , HN (N ≥3) be Hilbert spaces and Aj be a
densely deﬁned closable operator on Hj (j = 1, . . . , N). Then, the prop-
erties of A ⊗I proved in the following have natural correspondents to the
tensor product operator I ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗Aj ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I on ⊗N
i=1Hi. However,
we will not list them here because they are easily obtained from those of
A ⊗I.
3.5.1
Some estimates
Proposition 3.5. Let A be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
1For all Ψ ∈D(A⊗I), ∥(A⊗I)Ψ∥= ∥(I⊗A)UΨ∥and ⟨Ψ, (A ⊗I)Ψ⟩= ⟨UΨ, (I ⊗A)UΨ⟩.
Hence, for example, an estimate for ∥(A ⊗I)Ψ∥(resp., ⟨Ψ, (A ⊗I)Ψ⟩) gives an estimate
for ∥(I ⊗A)Φ∥(resp., ⟨Φ, (I ⊗A)Φ⟩) for Φ ∈D(I ⊗A).

(i) Suppose that there exists a constant c > 0 such that

(ii) If A is symmetric and A ≥γ, with a constant γ ∈R, then A ⊗I is
symmetric and
A ⊗I ≥γ.
(3.22)
Proof. (i) Let F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗K . Then, F is written as in (2.12), with Ψl ∈
D(A) and {fl}l is an ONS of K . Hence,
∥A ⊗I(F)∥2 =
M

l=1
∥AΨl∥2 ≥c2
M

l=1
∥Ψl∥2 = c2∥F∥2.
Since D(A)ˆ⊗K is a core for A ⊗I, we can apply Proposition 1.19 to the
case where T = A ⊗I, S = cI, a = 1 and b = 0 to obtain (3.21).
(ii) The symmetry of A ⊗I follows from Proposition 3.1(iii). Let F be
as in the proof of (i). Then,
⟨F, A ⊗I(F)⟩=
M

l=1
⟨Ψl, AΨl⟩≥γ
M

l=1
∥Ψl∥2 = γ∥F∥2.
A limiting argument similar to that in the proof of Proposition 1.19 gives
⟨F, A ⊗I(F)⟩≥γ∥F∥2, F ∈D(A ⊗I). Thus, A ⊗I ≥γ.

Remark 3.5. If A in Proposition 3.5 is a densely deﬁned closable operator
on K , then (3.21) and (3.22) hold, with A ⊗I replaced by I ⊗A (see the
preceding footnote).
The following proposition is fundamental for perturbation theories of
linear operators on tensor product Hilbert spaces.
Proposition 3.6. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H .
(i) Suppose that B is A-bounded, i.e., D(A) ⊂D(B), and there exist con-
stants a, b ≥0 such that
∥BΨ∥≤a∥AΨ∥+ b∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(A).

Then, D(A ⊗I) ⊂D(B ⊗I) and

F ∈D(A ⊗I).
(3.23)
(ii) Suppose that D(A) ⊂D(B), and there exist constants a, b ≥0 such that
∥BΨ∥2 ≤a2∥AΨ∥2 + b2∥Ψ∥2,

∥B ⊗I(F)∥2 ≤a2∥A ⊗I(F)∥2 + b2∥F∥2,
F ∈D(A ⊗I).

Hence, (3.23) holds for all F ∈D(A)ˆ⊗K . Since D(A)ˆ⊗K is a core for
A ⊗I, a simple application of Proposition 1.19 gives (3.23).
(ii) Let F be as in the proof of (i). Then,

Remark 3.6. If A and B are densely deﬁned closable operators on K , then
(3.23) and (3.24) hold, with A ⊗I and B ⊗I replaced by I ⊗A and I ⊗B,

Spectral properties of A ⊗I
In what follows, we take it for granted that H ̸= {0} and K ̸= {0}.
Lemma 3.3. Let A be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H .
(i)
ker(A ⊗I) = ker A ⊗K .
(3.25)
(ii) A is injective if and only if A ⊗I is injective.
(iii) Ran(A) is dense in H if and only if Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K .
(iv) A is bijective if and only if A ⊗I is bijective. In that case, (A ⊗I)−1
and A−1 are bounded, and
(A ⊗I)−1 = A−1 ⊗I.
(3.26)
Proof. (i) According to the decomposition theorem with respect to A
(Theorem 1.10(ii)), we have H = ker A ⊕Ran A∗. Hence,
H ⊗K = (ker A ⊗K ) ⊕(Ran A∗⊗K ).
For all Ψ ∈ker A ⊗I, ψ ∈D(A∗) and φ ∈K , we have
0 = ⟨(A ⊗I)Ψ, ψ ⊗φ⟩= ⟨Ψ, A∗ψ ⊗φ⟩.
Hence, Ψ ∈(Ran A∗ˆ⊗K )⊥, which implies that Ψ ∈(Ran A∗⊗K )⊥. Hence,
ker(A ⊗I) ⊂ker A ⊗K . To prove the converse inclusion relation, we ﬁrst
note that ker Aˆ⊗K
⊂ker(A ⊗I). Taking the closure of this inclusion
relation, we obtain ker A ⊗K ⊂ker(A ⊗I). Thus, (3.25) holds.
(ii) This follows from (i).
(iii) Suppose that Ran(A) is dense on H . It is obvious that
Ran(A)ˆ⊗K ⊂Ran(A⊗I). It follows from the assumption that Ran(A)ˆ⊗K
is dense in H ⊗K . Hence, Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K .
Conversely, assume that Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K . Suppose that
Ran(A) were not dense in H . Since H
= ker A∗⊕Ran(A) (Theorem
1.10(ii)), there exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈ker A∗. Then, for all φ ∈K
and Ψ ∈D(A ⊗I),
⟨ψ ⊗φ, (A ⊗I)Ψ⟩= ⟨A∗ψ ⊗φ, Ψ⟩= 0.
Hence, Ran(A ⊗I) is not dense. But this is a contradiction. Thus, Ran(A)
is dense in H .
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
167
(iv) Let A be bijective. Then, by (ii) and (iii), A ⊗I is injective and
Ran(A ⊗I) is dense in H ⊗K . By the present assumption and Theorem
1.5, A−1 is bounded. Hence,
(A ⊗I)(A−1 ⊗I) = I,
(A−1 ⊗I)(A ⊗I) ⊂I.
This means that A ⊗I is bijective, and (3.26) holds.
Conversely, let A ⊗I be bijective. Then, according to Theorem 1.5,
(A ⊗I)−1 is bounded, and by (ii) and (iii), A is injective and Ran(A) is
dense. We have, for all ψ ∈D(A−1) and φ ∈K ,
A−1ψ ⊗φ = (A ⊗I)−1ψ ⊗φ.
Suppose that A−1 were not bounded. Then, there exists a sequence {ψn}n
in D(A−1) such that ∥ψn∥= 1, n ∈N and ∥A−1ψn∥→∞(n →∞). Let
φ ∈K be a unit vector. Then, ∥ψn ⊗φ∥= 1, and from the equation given
above, we have
∥(A ⊗I)−1ψn ⊗φ∥= ∥A−1ψn∥→∞(n →∞).
This shows that (A⊗I)−1 is unbounded. But this is a contradiction. Hence,
A−1 is bounded. This fact and the closedness of A imply that Ran(A) is
closed. Hence, Ran(A) = H .
□
We can now identify the spectra of A ⊗I.
Theorem 3.3. Let A be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H . Then,
σ(A ⊗I) = σ(A).
(3.27)
Proof. Equation (3.27) is equivalent to ρ(A ⊗I) = ρ(A). Let us prove
this. Let λ ∈ρ(A). Then, the closed operator A −λ is bijective. Hence, by
Lemma 3.3(iv), (A −λ) ⊗I is bijective. It is easy to see that
A ⊗I −λ = (A −λ) ⊗I.
(3.28)
Hence, A ⊗I −λ is bijective. Therefore, by Proposition 1.7, λ ∈ρ(A ⊗I).
Thus, ρ(A) ⊂ρ(A ⊗I).
Conversely, let λ ∈ρ(A ⊗I). Then, (A −λ) ⊗I is bijective. Hence,
by Lemma 3.3(iv), A −λ is bijective. Therefore, by Proposition 1.7 again,
λ ∈ρ(A). Thus, ρ(A ⊗I) ⊂ρ(A).
□
168
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 3.4. For all λ ∈C,
ker(A ⊗I −λ) = ker(A −λ) ⊗K .
(3.29)
In particular,
σp(A ⊗I) = σp(A),
(3.30)
and for each λ ∈σp(A),
dim ker(A ⊗I −λ) = dim ker(A −λ) · dim K .
(3.31)
Proof. Equation (3.29) is just an application of Lemma 3.3(i), with A
replaced by A −λ (use also (3.28)). Properties (3.30) and (3.31) follow
from (3.29).
□
Remark 3.7. Formula (3.31) shows that, if K
is inﬁnite dimensional,
then the multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ ∈σp(A ⊗I) is inﬁnite even if the
multiplicity of λ ∈σp(A) is ﬁnite.
3.6
Eigenvalues of Tensor Product Operators
Proposition 3.7. Let A and B be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
and K , respectively. Then,
{λμ|λ ∈σp(A), μ ∈σp(B)} ⊂σp(A ⊗B).
(3.32)
{λ + μ|λ ∈σp(A), μ ∈σp(B)} ⊂σp(A ⊗I + I ⊗B).
(3.33)
Proof. Let λ ∈σp(A) and μ ∈σp(B). There exist non-zero vectors Ψ ∈
D(A) and Φ ∈D(B) such that AΨ = λΨ and BΦ = μΦ. Hence, Ψ ⊗Φ ∈
D(A ⊗B) ∩D(A ⊗I + I ⊗B) and
A ⊗B(Ψ ⊗Φ) = λμ(Ψ ⊗Φ), (A ⊗I + I ⊗B)Ψ ⊗Φ = (λ + μ)Ψ ⊗Φ.
Since Ψ ⊗Φ is not zero, λμ ∈σp(A ⊗B) and λ + μ ∈σp(A ⊗I + I ⊗B).
Thus, (3.32) and (3.33) hold.
□
3.7
Tensor Product of N Linear Operators with N ≥3
The concept of the tensor product of two linear operators can be easily
extended to the case of N linear operators. Let H1, . . . , HN be Hilbert
spaces and Aj be a densely deﬁned closable operator on Hj (j = 1, . . . , N).
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
169
Then, in the same way as in the case N = 2, one can show that there exists
a unique densely deﬁned closed operator ⊗N
j=1Aj on ⊗N
j=1Hj such that the
algebraic tensor product ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Aj) of D(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N) is a core for
⊗N
j=1Aj and
⊗N
j=1Aj(⊗N
j=1Ψj) = ⊗N
j=1AjΨj,
⊗N
j=1Ψj ∈ˆ⊗
N
j=1D(Aj).
We call the operator ⊗N
j=1Aj the tensor product of A1, . . . , AN.
Propositions 3.1–3.7 and Theorem 3.2 can be extended to the case of
⊗N
j=1Aj. Since it is an easy exercise to write down and prove the extended
versions, we omit the details. Here, we only prove the following proposition.
Generically, we use the symbol “0” to denote the zero operator on a Hilbert
space.
Proposition 3.8. Let A1, . . . , AN be as above. Then, ⊗N
j=1Aj ⊂0 if and
only if, for some j ∈{1, . . . , N}, Aj ⊂0.
Proof. Let ⊗N
j=1Aj ⊂0. Then, for all ψj ∈D(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N),
⊗N
j=1Ajψj = 0. Hence, 0 = ∥⊗N
j=1 Ajψj∥= N
j=1 ∥Ajψj∥. Suppose that,
for each j = 1, . . . , N, Aj ̸⊂0. Then, there exist vectors ψj ∈D(Aj) such
that Ajψj ̸= 0. Hence, N
j=1 ∥Aψj∥> 0. But this is a contradiction. Hence,
for some j, Aj ⊂0. The “if” part is obvious.
□
Remark 3.8. Also, in the case where each Aj is a densely deﬁned closable
operator from Hj to a Hilbert space Kj, the tensor product ⊗N
j=1Aj is
deﬁned, in exactly the same manner as above, as a densely deﬁned closed
operator from ⊗N
j=1Hj to ⊗N
j=1Kj (see Remarks 3.1 and 3.2).
3.8
Tensor Product of Self-Adjoint Operators
We now consider the tensor products of self-adjoint operators, which play
important roles in applications to quantum physics. Let H1, . . . , HN be
Hilbert spaces and Aj be a self-adjoint operator on Hj (j = 1, . . . , N). We
set
Aj := I ⊗· · · I⊗
jth
A j ⊗I · · · ⊗I
(3.34)
acting in ⊗N
k=1Hk. By Proposition 3.1(iii),2 Aj is a closed symmetric oper-
ator on ⊗N
k=1Hk.
2In what follows, when results in the theory of tensor product of two Hilbert spaces
are cited, they refer to the correspondents in the theory of tensor product of N Hilbert
spaces.
170
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 3.5. Let j = 1, . . . , N.
(i) Let Dk (k ̸= j) be a dense subspace of Hk and Dj be a core for Aj.
Then, Aj is essentially self-adjoint on ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk. In particular, Aj is
self-adjoint.
(ii) The spectral measure E 
Aj is given by
E 
Aj(B) = I ⊗· · · I⊗
jth
E Aj (B) ⊗I · · · ⊗I,
B ∈B1.

(iii) For all t ∈R and j = 1, . . . , N,

Aj = I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗
jth
eitAj ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I.
(iv) The N-tuple A := ( A1, . . . , AN) of self-adjoint operators is strongly
commuting.
(v) Let nj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N. Then, ( An1
1 , . . . , AnN
N ) is a set of strongly
commuting self-adjoint operators with

Aj
nj = I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗Anj
j
⊗I · · · ⊗I, j = 1, . . . , N.
(3.36)
Proof. (i) By Proposition 1.30, Fj := (Aj + i)Dj is dense in Hj. Hence,
G := D1 ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗
jth
Fj ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗DN
is dense in ⊗N
k=1Hk. Let Ψk ∈Dk (k ̸= j) and Φj ∈Fj. Then, there exists
a vector Ψj ∈Dj such that (Aj + i)Ψj = Φj. Hence, one has
( Aj + i)

⊗N
k=1Ψk

= Ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗
jth
Φj ⊗· · · ⊗ΨN.
Hence, ( Aj+i)(ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk) ⊃G . Hence, ( Aj+i)(ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk) is dense in ⊗N
k=1Hk.
Similarly, one can show that ( Aj −i)(ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk) is dense in ⊗N
k=1Hk. Hence,
by Proposition 1.30, Aj is essentially self-adjoint on ˆ⊗
N
k=1Dk. Thus, Aj is
self-adjoint.
(ii) Let
Ej(B) := I ⊗· · · I⊗
jth
E Aj (B) ⊗I · · · ⊗I,
B ∈B1.
Then, by Theorem 3.2(vii), Ej(B) is an orthogonal projection. It is obvious
that Ej(R) = I. Let Bl ∈B1 (l ∈N), with Bl ∩Bl′ = ∅(l ̸= l′) and
B := ∪∞
l=1Bl. Then, s- limn→∞
n
l=1 EAj(Bl) = EAj(B). Hence, we can
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
171
apply Proposition 3.3(ii) to obtain s- limn→∞
n
l=1 Ej(Bl) = Ej(B). Thus,
Ej is a one-dimensional spectral measure. Hence, using functional calculus,
the operator
Tj :=

R
λdEj(λ)
is self-adjoint on ⊗N
k=1Hk.
Let
D := H1 ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗
jth
D(Aj) ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗HN.
For all Φk, Ψk ∈Hk (k = 1, . . . , N) with Ψj ∈D(Aj), we have

R
λ2d∥EAj(λ)Ψj∥2 < ∞.
Hence, D ⊂D(Tj). Therefore, for all F ∈ˆ⊗


F, AjG

R
λd ⟨F, Ej(λ)G⟩= ⟨F, TjG⟩.
Hence, AjG = TjG, which implies that Aj ↾D ⊂Tj. Since D is a core for
Aj, it follows that Aj = Tj. Thus, Ej = E 
Aj.
(iii) By Theorem 3.2(vi), the operator
Xj := I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗
jth
eitAj ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I
is unitary. Let Φj, Ψj ∈Hj (j = 1, . . . , N). Then, by (ii), we have for all

This implies that, for all F, G ∈ˆ⊗

eit 
Aj and Xj are bounded and ˆ⊗
N
j=1Hj is dense in ⊗N
j=1Hj, it follows that
eit 
Aj = Xj.
(iv) By Theorem 3.2(ii), E 
Aj and E 
Ak (j ̸= k) commute. Hence, A is
strongly commuting.
(v) By part (iv) and Theorem 1.36, Anj
j
and Ank
k are strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators. It is easy to see that
Anj
j
⊃I ˆ⊗· · · ˆ⊗I ⊗Anj
j ˆ⊗I · · · ˆ⊗I.
Hence, Anj
j
⊃I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗Anj
j ⊗I · · · ⊗I. The operator on the right-hand
side is self-adjoint. Thus, operator equality (3.36) follows.
□
By Theorem 3.5, A has the joint spectral measure E 
A. We denote it by
E⊗
A1,...,AN:
E⊗
A1,...,AN := E 
A.
(3.37)
It follows that
E⊗
A1,...,AN(J1 × · · · × JN) = ⊗N

Jj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , N,
(3.38)
and
Aj =

A1,...,AN(λ).
(3.39)
An N-fold tensor product version of Theorem 3.3 yields the following
theorem:
Theorem 3.6. For all j = 1, . . . , N,
σ( 
Aj) = σ(Aj).
(3.40)
As for the joint spectrum σJ( A), we have the following theorem:
Theorem 3.7.
σJ( A) = σ(A1) × · · · × σ(AN).
(3.41)
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
173
Proof. By Theorem 3.6, we have
σ(A1) × · · · × σ(AN) = σ( A1) × · · · × σ( 
AN).
Hence, we need only to show that
σJ( A) = σ( A1) × · · · × σ( 
AN).
(3.42)
So, we check the suﬃcient condition in Theorem 1.39. Let λ ∈σ( A1)×· · ·×
σ( 
AN). Then, λj ∈σ(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N), and for all ε > 0,
E 
A1((λ1 −ε, λ + ε)) · · · E 
AN((λN −ε, λN + ε))
= ⊗N
j=1EAj((λj −ε, λj + ε)).
Since each EAj((λj −ε, λj + ε)) is not zero, it follows from Proposition 3.8
that E 
A1((λ1 −ε, λ+ε)) · · · E 
AN ((λN −ε, λN +ε)) ̸= 0. Hence, by Theorem
1.39, (3.42) holds.
□
Now, we are ready to investigate the basic properties of tensor product
operators formed out of self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 3.8. Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj and
SA1,...,AN :=

is self-adjoint. By (3.39) and Theorem 1.19(viii), we have SA1,...,AN ⊂T .
Hence, SA1,...,AN ⊂T . By (i), SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint. Since a self-adjoint
operator has no non-trivial symmetric extension (see Theorem 1.13), it
follows that SA1,...,AN = T .
(iii) This follows from (i) and Proposition 3.1(i).

By Theorem 3.5(iii), the right-hand side is equal to ⊗N

□
With regard to the kernel of SA1,...,AN, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.9. Assume that Aj ≥0 (j = 1, . . . , N). Then:
(i) SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint and non-negative.
(ii) If ker Aj = {0}, j = 1, . . . , N, then ker SA1,...,AN = {0}.
Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 3.8(iv).
(ii) Let Ψ ∈ker SA1,...,AN. Then, Ψ ∈D(SA1,...,AN) and SA1,...,ANΨ = 0.
Hence, ⟨Ψ, SA1,...,NΨ⟩= 0 · · · (∗). In the present case, σ(Aj) ⊂[0, ∞) (j = 1,
. . . , N). Hence, EAj([0, ∞)) = I. By (∗), (3.45) and (3.41), we have

[0,∞)N(λ1 + · · · + λN)d∥E⊗
A1,...,AN(λ1, . . . , λN)Ψ∥2 = 0.
This implies that
∥E⊗
A1,...,AN(D)Ψ∥2 = 0,
D := .[0, ∞)N \ {0}.

Since (0, ∞)N ⊂D, it follows that ∥E⊗
A1,...,AN((0, ∞)N)Ψ∥2 = 0. Hence,
E⊗
A1,...,AN((0, ∞)N)Ψ = 0. We have
E⊗
A1,...,AN((0, ∞)N) = ⊗N
j=1EAj((0, ∞)).
The assumption kerAj = {0} implies that EAj({0}) = 0. Hence, EAj
((0, ∞)) = EAj([0, ∞)) = I. Hence, E⊗
A1,...,AN((0, ∞)N) = I. Therefore,
Ψ = 0. Thus, ker SA1,...,AN = {0}.

In addition to the operator SA1,...,AN, the operators of the form ⊗N

□
We also note the following fact.
Proposition 3.9. Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj.
Then, ⊗N
j=1Aj is injective if and only if each Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) is injective.
In that case, (⊗N
j=1Aj)−1 = ⊗N
j=1A−1
j .
Proof. Suppose that, for some l, Al is not injective. Then, there is a
non-zero vector ψl ∈D(Al) such that Alψl = 0. Hence, for all ψj ∈
D(Aj) \ {0} (j ̸= l), Ψ := ⊗N
j=1ψj is a non-zero vector in D(⊗N
j=1Aj) and
(⊗N
j=1Aj)Ψ = 0. Hence, ker ⊗N
j=1Aj ̸= {0}. Thus, ⊗N
j=1Aj is not injective.
Conversely, suppose that each Aj is injective. Let Φ ∈ker(⊗N
j=1Aj).
Then, (⊗N
j=1Aj)Φ = 0. Hence, for all ψj
∈D(Aj) (j = 1, . . . , N),

⊗N
j=1ψj, (⊗N
j=1Aj)Φ

= 0, which implies that

⊗N
j=1Ajψj, Φ

= 0. Hence,
Φ is orthogonal to ˆ⊗
N
j=1Ran(Aj). By the injectivity of Aj, Ran(Aj) is
dense. Hence, ˆ⊗
N
j=1Ran(Aj) is dense. Therefore, Φ = 0, implying that
ker(⊗N
j=1Aj) = {0}. Thus, ⊗N
j=1Aj is injective.
By Theorem 3.10(i), ⊗N
j=1Aj is self-adjoint, and hence R := (⊗N
j=1Aj)−1
is self-adjoint. It is easy to see that R ⊃ˆ⊗
N
j=1A−1
j . Hence, R ⊃⊗N
j=1A−1
j .
By Theorem 3.10(i) again, the operator ⊗N
j=1A−1
j
is self-adjoint. Therefore,
R = ⊗N
j=1A−1
j .

Remark 3.9. Proposition 3.9 shows the following logical relation:

Example 3.2. For n = 1, . . . , N, let Vn be a real-valued Borel measurable
function on Rd, which is a.e. ﬁnite with respect to the Lebesgue measure on
Rd. Then, the multiplication operator by the function Vn is a self-adjoint
operator on L2(Rd). We denote it by the same symbol Vn. It is easy to see
that, for all fn ∈D(Vn) (n = 1, . . . , N),
Ud,N(V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN)f1 ⊗· · · ⊗fN = (V1 × · · · × VN)f1 × · · · × fN.
This implies that, for all Ψ ∈⊗

(V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN)Ψ = U −1
d,N(V1 × · · · × VN)Ud,NΨ.
By Theorem 3.10(ii), V1 ⊗· · ·⊗VN is essentially self-adjoint on ⊗

Hence, by Proposition 1.33, V1 × · · · × VN is essentially self-adjoint on

n=1D(Vn)], and the operator equality
Ud,N(V1 ⊗· · · ⊗VN)U −1

A basic example of (V1, . . . , VN) is given as follows: Vn(x(n)) = x(n)

(j = 1, . . . , d); Vm = 1 for m ̸= n. Let
X(n)
j

Then, by (3.50), the operator equality

j
(3.51)
holds, where the right-hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the

Using formula (3.51), one can see how a general multiplication operator
on L2(RdN) acts on ⊗N
n=1L2(Rd). Let V be a (not necessarily real-valued)
Borel measurable function on RdN such that |V | is a.e. ﬁnite with respect
to the Lebesgue measure on RdN. The set
X := {X(n)
j
|j = 1, . . . , d, n = 1, . . . , N}
of self-adjoint operators is strongly commuting. Hence, one can deﬁne using
functional calculus the operator

Point Spectra of Tensor Product of Self-Adjoint
Operators
Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on Hj and SA1,...,AN
be deﬁned by (3.43). Then, by Theorem 3.8(i), the closure SA1,...,AN of
SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint, and its spectrum is given by (3.44). In this section,
we identify the point spectrum of SA1,...,AN. For this purpose, we recall
the multiplication operator form of the spectral theorem of a self-adjoint
operator.
Theorem 3.12. Let H be a separable Hilbert space and T be a self-adjoint
operator on H . Then, there exist a ﬁnite measure space (X, Σ, μ), a real-
valued Σ-measurable function F on X which is a.e. ﬁnite with respect to μ,
and a unitary transformation U : H →L2(X, dμ) such that UT U −1 = F
(the multiplication operator by the function F).
Proof. See, for example, Theorem VIII.4 in Reed and Simon (1980).

Remark 3.10. In the case where 0 ∈σp(Aj0), for some j0, and σp(Aj1)
= ∅, for some j1 ̸= j0, (3.53) does not hold because, in this case, the
set on the right-hand side of (3.53) is empty; however, 0 ∈σp(⊗N
j=1Aj)
(note that, if ψj0 ∈(ker Aj0) \ {0} and ψj ∈D(Aj) \ {0}, j ̸= j0, then
(⊗N
j=1Aj)(⊗N
j=1ψj) = 0). This is the reason why the two cases (ii) and (iii)
should be considered separately.
Proof. (i) It is suﬃcient to show (3.52) in the case of N = 2 because (3.52)
with N ≥3 then follows from induction in N with the natural identiﬁcation
⊗N+1
j=1 Hj ∼= (⊗N
j=1Hj) ⊗HN+1 and the corresponding unitary equivalence
between SA1,...,AN+1 and (SA1,...,AN) ⊗I + I ⊗AN+1.
Let S := SA1,A2 and Λ := {λ1 + λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)}. Then,
by (3.33), Λ ⊂σp(S). Hence, we need only to prove the converse inclusion
relation.
Let λ ∈σp(S). There exists a non-zero vector Ψ ∈D(S) such that SΨ =
λΨ. By Theorem 3.12, there exist ﬁnite measure spaces (Xj, Σj, μj) (j =
1, 2), measurable functions Fj on Xj which are μj-a.e. ﬁnite respectively,
and unitary transformations Uj : Hj →L2(Xj, dμj), j = 1, 2, such that
UjAjU −1
j
= Fj. Then, U1 ⊗U2 is a unitary transformation from H1 ⊗H2
to L2(X1, dμ1) ⊗L2(X2, dμ2), and the following operator equalities hold:
(U1 ⊗U2)(A1 ⊗I)(U1 ⊗U2)−1 = F1 ⊗I,
(U1 ⊗U2)(I ⊗A2)(U1 ⊗U2)−1 = I ⊗F2.
Let W : L2(X1, dμ1) ⊗L2(X2, dμ2) →L2(X1 × X2, d(μ1 ⊗μ2)) be the
natural isomorphism. Then, U := WU1 ⊗U2 is a unitary transformation
from H1 ⊗H2 to L2(X1 × X2, d(μ1 ⊗μ2)), and the operator equality
USU −1 = F1 + F2
holds, where the right-hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the
function F1 + F2 on L2(X1 × X2, d(μ1 ⊗μ2)). Hence, letting Φ := UΨ, we
have (F1 +F2)Φ = λΦ · · · (∗). Since 0 <
'
X1×X2 |Φ(x, y)|2dμ1(x)⊗dμ2(y) <
∞, it follows from Fubini’s theorem that there exists a subset K ⊂X2
such that μ2(K) > 0, and, for all y ∈K,
'
X1 |Φ(x, y)|2dμ1(x) > 0. By
(∗), we have
'
X1 |F1(x) + F2(y) −λ|2|Φ(x, y)|2dμ1(x) = 0, y ∈K. Hence,
letting φy(·) := Φ(·, y) (y ∈K), we see that φy is in L2(X1, dμ1) \ {0} and
(F1 + F2(y) −λ)φy = 0 as an equality in L2(X1, dμ1). Therefore, λ −F2(y)
is an eigenvalue of F1. For s ∈σp(A1) = σp(F1), let Ks := {y ∈X2|s = λ−
F2(y)}. Then, K ⊂∪s∈σp(A1)Ks. Since H1 is separable, it follows that the
182
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
cardinality of σp(A1) is at most countable. Hence, there exists a λ1 ∈σp(A1)
such that μ2(Kλ1) > 0. Then, the characteristic function3 χKλ1 of Kλ1 is a
non-zero element of L2(X2, dμ2) satisfying F2χKλ1 = (λ −λ1)χKλ1. Hence,
λ2 := λ −λ1 is in σp(F2) = σp(A2). Thus, λ = λ1 + λ2 ∈Λ, implying
σp(S) ⊂Λ.
(ii) By a reason similar to that in (i), it is suﬃcient to show (3.53) in
the case of N = 2. It follows from Proposition 3.7 that
{λ1λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)} ⊂σp(A1 ⊗A2).
(3.55)
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(A1 ⊗A2). Then,
there exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈D(A1 ⊗A2) satisfying A1 ⊗A2ψ = λψ.
Let η := Uψ. Then, in the same manner as in the proof of (i), we can
show that there exists a subset Y ⊂X2, μ2(Y ) > 0, and for all y ∈Y ,
'
X1 |η(x, y)|2dμ1(x) > 0 and
'
X1 |F1(x)F2(y) −λ|2|η(x, y)|2dμ1(x) = 0.
Hence, letting ηy(·) := η(·, y) (y ∈Y ), we see that ηy is in L2(X1, dμ1)\{0}
and (F1F2(y)−λ)ηy = 0 as an equality in L2(X1, dμ1). Since 0 ̸∈σp(A2), it
follows that F2(y) ̸= 0, for μ2-a.e. y. Hence, letting Y ′ := {y ∈Y |F2(y) ̸= 0},
we have μ2(Y ′) > 0, and for all y ∈Y ′, λ/F2(y) is an eigenvalue of F1. For
s ∈σp(A1) = σp(F1), let Ys := {y ∈X2|F2(y) ̸= 0, s = λ/F2(y)}. Then,
Y ′ ⊂∪s∈σp(A1)Ys. Hence, there exists a λ1 ∈σp(A1) such that μ2(Yλ1) > 0.
Then, the characteristic function χYλ1 is a non-zero element of L2(X2, dμ2)
satisfying F2χYλ1 = (λ/λ1)χYλ1. Hence, λ2
:=
λ/λ1 is in σp(F2)
=
σp(A2). Thus, λ = λ1λ2 implying σp(A1 ⊗A2) ⊂{λ1λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1),
λ2 ∈σp(A2)}.
(iii) In the present case too, (3.55) holds. By this fact and Remark 3.10,
we have {0} ∪{λ1λ2|λ1 ∈σp(A1), λ2 ∈σp(A2)} ⊂σp(A1 ⊗A2). To prove
the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(A1 ⊗A2). Then, there exists a
non-zero vector ψ ∈D(A1⊗A2) satisfying A1⊗A2ψ = λψ. It is suﬃcient to
consider the case where λ ̸= 0. Without loss of generality, we may assume
that 0 ∈σp(A2). Let η := Uψ and Y be the set in the proof of (ii) and
Y0 := {y ∈Y |F2(y) = 0}. Then, it follows that, for all y ∈Y0, ηy = 0. But
ηy ̸= 0, for all y ∈Y . Hence, Y0 = ∅. Therefore, for all y ∈Y , F2(y) ̸= 0
and F1ηy = (λ/F2(y))ηy. Then, in the same manner as in the proof of (ii),
one can show that, for some λj ∈σp(Aj) (j = 1, 2), λ = λ1λ2. Hence, the
converse inclusion relation of (3.55) holds.

Tensor Product of Linear Operators

We can also clarify the structures of the eigenspaces of SA1,...,AN and
⊗N
j=1Aj. To state them, we introduce some symbols.
For a self-adjoint operator A on a Hilbert space H , we deﬁne the fol-
lowing two closed subspaces:
Hp(A) := Ran EA(σp(A)),
Hc(A) := Ran EA(σc(A)),
(3.56)
where EA is the spectral measure of A and σp(A) (resp., σc(A)) is the
point (resp., continuous) spectrum of A. If H is separable, then σp(A) is
at most countable, and hence Hp(A) is the closed subspace generated by
linear combinations of the eigenvectors of A (see Proposition 1.39).
Since the residual spectrum of A is empty (see Theorem 1.14(ii)), it
follows that
σ(A) = σp(A) ∪σc(A),
and hence
H = Hp(A) ⊕Hc(A).
(3.57)
The operator A is reduced by Hp(A) (resp., Hc(A)). We denote the
reduced part of A to Hp(A) (resp., Hc(A)) by Ap (resp., Ac). Hence, we
have the direct sum decomposition
A = Ap ⊕Ac
(3.58)
relative to (3.57).
Theorem 3.14. Assume that each Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) is separable.
(i)
Hp(SA1,...,AN) = ⊗N
j=1Hp(Aj)
and

SA1,...,AN

p = SA1p,...,ANp,
where Ajp is the reduced part of Aj to Hp(Aj).
(ii) If each Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) is injective, then
Hp(⊗N
j=1Aj) = ⊗N
j=1Hp(Aj).

j=1Aj is not injective, then

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We need only to consider the case of N = 2 (see the remark at the
beginning of the proof of Theorem 3.13).
(i) We set S := SA1,A2. By (3.57) and (3.58), we have
Hj = Hp(Aj) ⊕Hc(Aj),
Aj = Ajp ⊕Ajc,
j = 1, 2.
Hence,
H1 ⊗H2 = (Hp(A1) ⊗Hp(A2)) ⊕(Hp(A1) ⊗Hc(A2))
⊕(Hc(A1) ⊗Hp(A2)) ⊕(Hc(A1) ⊗Hc(A2)),
(3.61)
where the equality is taken in the sense of the natural identiﬁcation. By
Proposition 3.4(ii), S is reduced by each H#(A1) ⊗H♮(A2) (#, ♮= p, c),
with the reduced part equal to A1# ⊗I + I ⊗A2♮and
S = ⊕#,♮=p,c

A1# ⊗I + I ⊗A2♮

relative
to
(3.61).
By
Theorem
3.13(i),
A1c ⊗I + I ⊗A2♮
and
A1# ⊗I + I ⊗A2c have no eigenvalues. Hence, Hp(S) = Hp(A1)⊗Hp(A2)
and Sp = A1p ⊗I + I ⊗A2p.
(ii) By Proposition 3.4(i), A1 ⊗A2 is reduced by each H#(A1)⊗H♮(A2)
(#, ♮= p, c), with the reduced part equal to A1# ⊗A2♮and
A1 ⊗A2 = ⊕#,♮=p,cA1# ⊗A2♮
relative to (3.61). It is obvious that A1c ⊗A2c has no eigenvalues. These
facts do not depend on whether each Aj is injective or not.
Now, assume that A1 and A2 are injective. Then, the reduced part
of A1p ⊗A2c and A1c ⊗A2p have no eigenvalues. Hence, it follows that
(A1 ⊗A2)p = A1p ⊗A2p and Hp(A1 ⊗A2) = Hp(A1) ⊗Hp(A2).
(iii) Under the present assumption, ker(A1⊗A2) ̸= {0}. Hence, ker(A1⊗
A2) ⊂Hp(A1 ⊗A2). Therefore, we have the orthogonal decomposition
Hp(A1 ⊗A2) = ker(A1 ⊗A2) ⊕Ran((A1 ⊗A2)p).
By Proposition 3.9, A1 or A2 is not injective. Hence, H1p⊗H2c or H1c⊗H2p
is a subset of ker(A1 ⊗A2). Hence, Ran((A1 ⊗A2)p) = Ran(A1p ⊗A2p).
By this fact and Proposition 3.1(iv), we have
Ran((A1 ⊗A2)p) = Ran(A1p) ⊗Ran(A2p) = (ker A1p)⊥⊗(ker A2p)⊥.
Tensor Product of Linear Operators

It is easy to see that (ker Ajp)⊥= Hp(Aj) ∩(ker Aj)⊥(j = 1, 2). Hence,
(3.60) with N = 2 holds.

Exponential Type Operators Formed Out of Tensor
Products of Self-Adjoint Operators
Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a Hilbert space and Aj be a self-adjoint operator
on Hj. Then, the operator SA1,...,AN, deﬁned by (3.43), is essentially self-
adjoint and has properties as described in Theorem 3.8.
Theorem 3.15. Suppose that each Aj is bounded from below. Then,
SA1,...,AN is self-adjoint and bounded from below. Moreover, for all z ∈C+,
e−zSA1,...,AN is bounded and
e−zSA1,...,AN = ⊗N
j=1e−zAj.
(3.62)
Proof. The
ﬁrst
half
of
the
theorem
is
just
a
restatement
of
Theorem 3.8(iv). In the same way as in Theorem 3.5(iii), one can prove
that
e−z 
Aj = I ⊗· · · I ⊗e−zAj ⊗I · · · ⊗I.
Hence,
e−zSA1,...,AN = e−z 

Thus, (3.62) holds.

Tensor Product Operators and Direct Integral
Operators
Let (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space and H be a Hilbert space. We assume
that L2(X, dμ) is separable. Then, L2(X, dμ) ⊗H is naturally isomorphic
to L2(X, dμ; H ) =
' ⊕
X H dμ (Theorem 2.6). A natural question is: To what
forms are tensor product operators on L2(X, dμ) ⊗H transformed under
this isomorphism? In the following, we give a partial answer to this question.
Let U : L2(X, dμ) ⊗H →L2(X, dμ; H ) be the unitary transformation
in Theorem 2.6. Let S be a densely deﬁned closed operator on L2(X, dμ).
Then, in the same way as in the case of the deﬁnition of the algebraic
tensor product of two closable operators, one can deﬁne a linear operator
186
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
S0 on L2(X, dμ; H ) satisfying the following: D(S0) = span {f×u|f ∈D(S),
u ∈H }, and for all fj ∈D(S) and uj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , N, N ∈N),
S0
⎛
⎝
N

j=1
fj × uj
⎞
⎠=
N

j=1
(Sfj) × uj.
Then, it is easy to see that S0 is a densely deﬁned closable operator and
S ⊗I = U −1S0U on D(S)ˆ⊗H . Since D(S)ˆ⊗H is a core of S ⊗I, it follows
that
S ⊗I = U −1S0U.
Hence,
U(S ⊗I)U −1 = S0.
(3.63)
Under the natural identiﬁcation of L2(X, dμ) ⊗H with L2(X, dμ; H ) =
' ⊕
X H dμ, S0 is simply written S usually.
With regard to tensor product operators of the form I ⊗T , with T being
a densely deﬁned closable operator on H , we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3.16. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then,
U(I ⊗T )U −1 =
 ⊕
X
T dμ(x).
(3.64)
Proof. Let D0 := span {f×u|f ∈L2(X, dμ), u ∈D(T )}. Then, U −1(D0) =
L2(X, dμ)ˆ⊗D(T )). By direct computations, one has
U(I ⊗T )U −1 ↾D0 ⊂
 ⊕
X
T dμ(x).
Since L2(X, dμ)ˆ⊗D(T ) is a core for I ⊗T , D0 is a core for U(I ⊗T )U −1. By
Theorem 2.7,
' ⊕
X T dμ is self-adjoint. Hence, U(I ⊗T )U −1 ⊂
' ⊕
X T dμ(x).
Since U(I ⊗T )U −1 is self-adjoint, (3.64) follows.

Problems
In this section, H and K denote Hilbert spaces.
(1) A bounded linear operator T ∈B(H , K ) is said to be a Hilbert–
Schmidt if, for some CONS {ξn}∞
n=1 of H , ∞
n=1 ∥T ξn∥2 < ∞. We
denote by B2(H , K ) the set of Hilbert–Schmidt operators from H to
K . Let T ∈B2(H , K ).
Tensor Product of Linear Operators
187
(i) Prove that, for every CONS {en}∞
n=1 of H , ∞
n=1 ∥T en∥2 con-
verges and is independent of the choice of {en}∞
n=1.
The non-negative number ∥T ∥2 :=

∞
n=1 ∥T en∥21/2 is called
the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of T .
(ii) Prove that the adjoint T ∗of T is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator
from K to H and ∥T ∥2 = ∥T ∗∥2.
(iii) Prove that B2(H , K ) is a vector space.
(iv) For T, S ∈B2(H , K ), deﬁne ⟨S, T ⟩2 ∈C by ⟨S, T ⟩2 :=
∞
n=1 ⟨Sen, T en⟩, where {en}∞
n=1 is a CONS of H . Prove that
⟨S, T ⟩2 is independent of the choice of {en}∞
n=1 and is an inner
product of B2(H , K ).
(v) Prove that B2(H , K ) is complete with respect to the inner prod-
uct ⟨, ⟩2 (and hence B2(H , K ) is a Hilbert space).
(vi) For each pair (Ψ, Φ) ∈H × K , we deﬁne PΨ,Φ : H →K by
PΨ,Φ(χ) := ⟨Ψ, χ⟩Φ,
χ ∈H .
Prove that PΨ,Φ ∈B2(H , K ) and ∥PΨ,Φ∥2 = ∥Ψ ⊗Φ∥.
(vii) Let {en}∞
n=1 and {fn}∞
n=1 be the CONSs of H and K , respec-
tively. Prove that {Pen,fm}n,m∈N is a CONS of B2(H , K ).
(viii) Let C be a conjugation on H , i.e., C is an anti-linear mapping
on H , such that ∥CΨ∥= ∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈H and C2 = I. Prove that
there exists a unique unitary transformation UC from B2(H , K )
to H ⊗K such that UC(PCΨ,Φ) = Ψ ⊗Φ, Ψ ∈H , Φ ∈K .
Remark. Part (viii) establishes a natural isomorphism between B2(H , K )
and H ⊗K . This natural isomorphism, written as B2(H , K ) ∼= H ⊗K , is
sometimes useful in quantum (statistical) mechanics (see, for example, Arai,
2008).
(2) Let Aj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space Hj.
(i) Suppose that Aj ≥0 and ker Aj = {0}, j = 1, . . . , N. Show that
SA1,...,AN is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on ⊗N
j=1Hj and
ker SA1,...,AN = {0}.
(ii) Let fΣ : RN →R be deﬁned by
fΣ(λ) :=
N

j=1
λj,
λ = (λ1, . . . , λN) ∈RN.
Prove that

∥B∥≤1). Prove that A ⊗B is a contraction operator.
(4) Let A ∈B(H ) and B ∈B(K ) be normal operators.
(i) Prove that A ⊗B is normal.
(ii) Prove that A ⊗I + I ⊗B is normal.
(5) Let Q and P be symmetric operators on H satisfying the Heisenberg
canonical commutation relation (CCR) [Q, P] = iℏon a subspace
Dc ⊂H satisfying Dc ⊂D(QP)∩D(PQ)∩D(Q2)∩D(P 2)). Let n ≥2
and deﬁne operators ˆQj, ˆPj (j = 1, . . . , n) on ⊗nH as follows:
ˆQj := I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗
jth
⌣
Q ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I,
ˆPj := I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗
jth
⌣
P ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I.
Prove that the operators ˆQj and ˆPj (j = 1, . . . , n) satisfy the Heisen-
berg CCR with n degrees of freedom,
[ ˆQj, ˆQk] = 0, [ ˆPj, ˆPk] = 0, [ ˆQj, ˆPk] = iℏδjk (j, k = 1, . . . , n) · · · (∗),
on ˆ⊗
nDc.
Remark. A triplet (X , D, {Qj, Pj|j = 1, . . . , n}) consisting of a Hilbert space
X , a subspace D of X and a set {Qj, Pj|j = 1, . . . , n} of symmetric oper-
ators on X is called a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with
n degrees of freedom if D ⊂∩n
j,k=1D(QjPk) ∩D(PkQj) ∩D(QjQk) ∩
D(PjPk) and {Qj, Pj|j = 1, . . . , n} satisﬁes the Heisenberg CCR with n
degrees of freedom on D (i.e., (∗), with ˆPj and ˆQj replaced by Pj and Qj
(j = 1, . . . , n), respectively, holds on D). In this deﬁnition, one may take
D to be dense in X and an invariant domain of Qj and Pj, j = 1, . . . , n
(cf. Problems 19 and 21 in Chapter 1). Problem 5 means that one can con-
struct a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with n degrees of freedom
from a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with one degree of freedom.
This shows an aspect of usefulness of the tensor product concepts in repre-
senting algebraic structures.
(6) Let Q and P be as in Problem 5 and Γ1 and Γ2 be bounded self-adjoint
operators on K satisfying the anti-commutation relations
{Γs, Γr} = 2δrs,

(iii) Prove that Γ3 is a bounded self-adjoint operator and Γ 2
3 = I.
(iv) Prove that
S2 = (P 2 + λ2Q2) ⊗I −λℏ(I ⊗Γ3)
on Dc ˆ⊗K .
(7) Let A1 and A2 be densely deﬁned commuting closable operators on H
([A1, A2] = 0 on D([A1, A2]) and B1 and B2 be densely deﬁned anti-
commuting closable operators on K ({B1, B2} = 0 on D({B1, B2}) :=
D(B1B2) ∩D(B2B1)).

(ii) Let T := A1 ⊗B1 + A2 ⊗B2. Prove that, for all Ψ ∈[D(A1A2) ∩
D(A2A1)∩D(A2

Ψ is in D(T 2) and
T 2Ψ = (A2

2)Ψ.
Remark. In the case where Aj and Bj (j = 1, 2) are self-adjoint oper-
ators, one can replace the commutativity of A1 and A2 and the anti-
commutativity of B1 and B2 by the strong one, respectively, to obtain
stronger results, which may have applications to operator theory (Arai,
1993a) and supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theory (Arai, 1995).

Full Fock Spaces and Second
Quantization Operators
For a Hilbert space H , the inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n H of the
n-fold tensor product ⊗nH (n ≥0) with ⊗0H := C is called the full Fock
space over H . This Hilbert space is the main subject of this chapter. There
is a fundamental class of linear operators acting in the full Fock space, called
second quantization operators. Their basic properties are investigated. The full
Fock space is a basis for the mathematical theories of quantum ﬁelds.
4.1
Inﬁnite Direct Sum Hilbert Spaces
From this chapter, we develop the theory of Fock spaces, which is one of
the main subjects in this book. This theory can be viewed as the theory
of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert spaces of certain types. Therefore, to clearly
understand the nature of Fock spaces, it would be better to develop in
advance a general theory of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert spaces. Thus, we
ﬁrst present the elements of a general theory of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert
spaces.
Let {Hn}∞
n=0 be a sequence of Hilbert spaces (where each Hn is a
Hilbert space). Then, it is natural to consider the inﬁnite product space of
Hn’s:
∞

n=0
Hn :=

Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0
Ψ (n) ∈Hn, n ≥0

.
By deﬁnition, the two elements Ψ and Φ in ∞
n=0 Hn are equal if and only
if Ψ (n) = Φ(n), for all n ≥0. In this case, one writes Ψ = Φ.
The set ∞
n=0 Hn becomes a complex vector space with the following
operations of addition and scalar multiplication: For all Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0,
191
192
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Φ = {Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈∞
n=0 Hn, α ∈C,
Ψ + Φ := {Ψ (n) + Φ(n)}∞
n=0,
αΨ := {αΨ (n)}∞
n=0.
The zero vector is given by 0 = {0Hn}∞
n=0, where 0Hn denotes the zero
vector in Hn (we simply write it 0 in the following). Hence, Ψ = 0 if and
only if Ψ (n) = 0, for all n ≥0.
For each Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0 ∈∞
n=0 Hn, its inverse vector −Ψ is equal to
{−Ψ (n)}∞
n=0.
By the elementary inequality
|z + w|2 ≤2(|z|2 + |w|2),
z, w ∈C,
(4.1)
we have for all Ψ, Φ ∈∞
n=0 Hn and α, β ∈C,
∥αΨ n) + βΦ(n)∥2 ≤2

|α|2∥Ψ (n)∥2 + |β|2∥Φ(n)∥2
,
n ∈N.
Hence, it follows that the subset
⊕∞
n=0Hn :=
	
Ψ ∈
∞

n=0
Hn

∞

n=0
∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞

is a subspace of ∞
n=0 Hn. By the Schwarz inequality and (2.28), we have
for all Ψ, Φ ∈⊕∞
n=0Hn,

Hence, the inﬁnite series

is absolutely convergent. The mapping ⟨, ⟩: (⊕∞
n=0Hn) × (⊕∞
n=0Hn) →C
is an inner product of ⊕∞
n=0Hn. Moreover, it is shown that ⊕∞
n=0Hn is
complete with respect to this inner product.1 Thus, ⊕∞
n=0Hn becomes a
Hilbert space. This Hilbert space is called the inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert

absolutely square summable sequences on N.

space (or simply inﬁnite direct sum) of {Hn}∞
n=0. In this case, Hn is called
the nth component (or the nth Hilbert space) of ⊕∞
n=0Hn.
In the rest of this chapter, we set
H := ⊕∞
n=0Hn.
(4.2)
For each m ≥0 and ψ ∈Hm, there is a vector ψ ∈H deﬁned as follows:
ψ(m) := ψ; ψ(n) := 0 for n ̸= m. Then, the correspondence ψ →˜ψ gives
an isometric embedding of Hm into H (∥ψ∥= ∥ψ∥). In other words, Hm is
unitarily equivalent to the closed subspace

Hm :=
		
0, . . . , 0,
m
⌣

ψ ∈Hm

of H. In this sense, we can identify each element ψ of Hm with the ele-
ment ψ in H and Hm with

Hm. We call this identiﬁcation the natural
identiﬁcation of Hm with 
Hm. In what follows, we freely use the natural
identiﬁcation. In this case, ψ will be simply written as ψ if there would be no
danger of confusion. Under the natural identiﬁcation just mentioned, each
vector Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0 ∈H is written as Ψ = ∞
n=0 Ψ (n), which expresses a
natural orthogonal decomposition of Ψ (note that, under the natural iden-
tiﬁcation, Ψ (n) ⊥Ψ (m), n ̸= m).
Let Dn be a subspace of Hn (n ≥0). Then, one can deﬁne a subspace
of H by
⊕∞
n=0Dn := {Ψ ∈H|Ψ (n) ∈Dn, n ≥0}.
One can also deﬁne a smaller subspace as follows:
⊕
∞
n=0Dn :=

Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0
Ψ (n) ∈Dn, n ≥0,
∃n0 ∈N such that, for all n ≥n0, Ψ (n) = 0

.
This subspace is called the algebraic direct sum (or incompleted direct
sum) of {Dn}∞
n=0 (Problem 1). It is obvious that
⊕
∞
n=0Dn ⊂⊕∞
n=0Dn.
(4.3)
Proposition 4.1.
(i) If each Dn is closed, then ⊕∞
n=0Dn is a closed subspace of H.
(ii) If each Dn is dense in Hn, then ⊕
∞
n=0Dn is dense in H.
(iii) If each Dn is dense in Hn, then ⊕∞
n=0Dn is dense in H.

∞

n=N+1
∥Ψ (n)∥2 →0 (N →∞).
Hence, for any ε > 0, there exists an N0 ∈N such that, for all N ≥N0,
∥ΨN −Ψ∥< ε/2. By the density of Dn in Hn, there exist vectors Φ(m) ∈
Dm, m = 0, . . . , N0, such that ∥Φ(m) −Ψ (m)
N0 ∥< ε/(2(N0 + 1)). Hence, the
vector χ := {Φ(0), . . . , Φ(N0), 0, 0, . . .} is in ⊕
∞
n=0Dn and ∥χ −ΨN0∥< ε/2.
Therefore, using the triangle inequality, we have ∥χ −Ψ∥< ε. This implies
that ⊕
∞
n=0Dn is dense in ⊕∞
n=0Hn.
(iii) This follows from (4.3) and (ii).

With regard to the CONSs of H, one has the following fact.
Proposition 4.2. Let {e(n)
j
}∞
j=1 be a CONS of Hn. Then, {
e(n)
j
|j ∈N,
n ≥0} is a CONS of H.
Proof. It is easy to see that the set S := {
e(n)
j
|j ∈N, n ≥0} is an ONS
of H. The subspace Fn := span

e(n)
j
∞
j=1 is dense in Hn and span S =
⊕
∞
n=0Fn. Hence, by Proposition 4.1(ii), span S is dense in H. Thus, S is a
CONS of H.
□
Proposition 4.2 immediately yields the following corollary.
Corollary 4.1. If each Hn is separable (n ≥0), then H is separable.

Inﬁnite Direct Sum Operators
Let Kn (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) be Hilbert spaces and
K := ⊕∞
n=0Kn.

For each set {An}∞
n=0 of linear operators An from Hn to Kn (i.e., An ∈
L(Hn, Kn)), one can deﬁne a linear operator ⊕∞
n=0An ∈L(H, K), as follows:

,
(⊕∞
n=0An)Ψ := {AnΨ (n)}∞
n=0,
Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0An).
The operator ⊕∞
n=0An is called the inﬁnite direct sum operator (or
simply the inﬁnite direct sum) of {An}∞
n=0.
It is obvious that
⊕
∞
n=0D(An) ⊂D(⊕∞
n=0An).
(4.4)
Remark 4.1. Similarly, one can also deﬁne a ﬁnite direct sum operator
⊕N
n=0An (N ∈N) as a linear operator from the ﬁnite direct sum Hilbert
space ⊕N
n=0Hn to ⊕N
n=0Kn:

.
The theory of ﬁnite direct sum operators can be developed quite parallel
to that of inﬁnite direct sum operators in an easier way (for the case Kn =
Hn, n = 0, . . . , N, we have mentioned it brieﬂy in Section 1.4).
Proposition 4.3. Let Bn ∈L(H , K ) (n ≥0). Suppose that ⊕∞
n=0An =
⊕∞
n=0Bn. Then, An = Bn, n ≥0.
Proof. For each m ≥0 and ψ ∈D(Am), we deﬁne Ψ ∈H by Ψ (m) = ψ,
Ψ (n) = 0, n ̸= m. Then, Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0An) = D(⊕∞
n=0Bn). Hence, ψ ∈D(Bm)
and Amψ = Bmψ. Therefore, Am ⊂Bm. By symmetry, Bm ⊂Am. Thus,
Am = Bm.
□
In what follows, we set
A := ⊕∞
n=0An.
(4.5)
We ﬁrst examine injectivity and surjectivity of A.
196
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proposition 4.4.
(i) kerA = ⊕∞
n=0 ker An. In particular, A is injective if and only if An is
injective, for all n ≥0.
(ii) Suppose that, for all n ≥0, ∥Anψ∥≥C∥ψ∥, ψ ∈D(An), with the
constant C > 0 independent of n. Then,
Ran(A) = ⊕∞
n=0Ran(An).
(4.6)
In particular, A is surjective if and only if each An (n ≥0) is surjective.
Proof. (i) This follows from the following logical relations: Ψ ∈ker A ⇐⇒
Ψ ∈D(A), AΨ = 0 ⇐⇒Ψ ∈H, Ψ (n) ∈D(An), AnΨ (n) = 0, n ≥0 ⇐⇒Ψ ∈
H, Ψ (n) ∈ker An, n ≥0 ⇐⇒Ψ ∈⊕∞
n=0 ker An.
(ii) It is obvious that Ran(A) ⊂⊕∞
n=0Ran(An). Let Φ = {Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈
⊕∞
n=0Ran(An). Then, for each n ≥0, there exists a vector Ψ (n)
∈
D(An) such that AnΨ (n) = Φ(n) · · · (∗). We have ∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 =
∞
n=0 ∥Φ(n)∥2 < ∞. Hence, ∞
n=0 ∥Ψ (n)∥2 ≤
1
C2
∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞.
Therefore, Ψ ∈D(A). Then, (∗) implies that AΨ = Φ. Hence, Φ ∈Ran(A).
Thus, (4.6) holds.
□
The following proposition is a basic fact on the boundedness of an inﬁ-
nite direct sum operator.
Proposition 4.5. Let An ∈B(Hn, Kn), n ≥0. Then, A ∈B(H, K) if and
only if
sup
n≥0
∥An∥< ∞.
(4.7)
In that case,
∥A∥= sup
n≥0
∥An∥.
(4.8)
Proof. Let CA := supn≥0 ∥An∥, which may be inﬁnite.
Suppose that A ∈B(H, K). Then, for all Ψ ∈H, ∥AΨ∥≤∥A∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence, ∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 ≤∥A∥2∥Ψ∥2. Taking Ψ to be a vector such that
Ψ (m) = 0, ∀m ̸= n, one has ∥AnΨ (n)∥≤∥A∥∥Ψ (n)∥. This implies that
∥An∥≤∥A∥. Hence, CA ≤∥A∥< ∞. Thus, (4.7) holds.
Conversely, suppose that (4.7) holds: CA < ∞. Then, for all Ψ ∈H,
∞

n=0
∥AnΨ (n)∥2 ≤C2
A
∞

n=0
∥Ψ (n)∥2 = C2
A∥Ψ∥2 < ∞.

197
This implies that D(A) = H and ∥AΨ∥≤CA∥Ψ∥. Hence, A ∈B(H, K) and
∥A∥≤CA. These arguments imply (4.8) too.
□
Remark 4.2. It follows from Proposition 4.5 that, even if all An are
bounded, A is unbounded if supn≥0 ∥An∥= ∞.
The following fact on the unboundedness of A is also fundamental.
Proposition 4.6. If at least one of An is unbounded, then A is unbounded.
Proof. Under the present assumption, there is a k ∈Z+ such that Ak is
unbounded. Then, there exists a sequence {ψN}∞
N=1 in D(Ak) such that
∥ψN∥= 1, ∥AkψN∥→∞(N →∞). We deﬁne a vector ΨN ∈H by
Ψ (k)
N
:= ψN; Ψ (n)
N
:= 0, n ̸= k. Then, ΨN ∈D(A), ∥ΨN∥= 1 and ∥AΨN∥=
∥AkψN∥→∞(N →∞). Hence, A is unbounded.
□
The following proposition is concerned with the convergences of a
sequence of bounded inﬁnite direct sum operators.
Proposition 4.7. Let An,N, An ∈B(Hn, Kn), n ≥0, N ∈N and
A(N) :=
∞

n=0
An,N.
Suppose that
sup
n≥0,N∈N
∥An,N∥< ∞.
(4.9)
Then, A(N) ∈B(H, K) and the following hold:
(i) If w- limN→∞An,N = An, for all n ≥0, then A ∈B(H, K) and
w- lim
N→∞A(N) = A.
(4.10)
(ii) If s- limN→∞An,N = An,
n ≥0, then A ∈B(H, K) and
s- lim
N→∞A(N) = A.
(4.11)
(iii) If limN→∞supn≥0 ∥An,N −An∥= 0, then A ∈B(H, K) and
u- lim
N→∞A(N) = A.
(4.12)
198
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. The fact A(N) ∈B(H, K) follows from (4.9) and Proposition 4.5.
(i) Let Φ ∈K and Ψ ∈D(A). Then,
⟨Φ, A(N)Ψ⟩=
∞

n=0

Φ(n), An,NΨ (n)
.
We have


Φ(n), An,NΨ (n) ≤∥An,N∥∥Φ(n)∥∥Ψ (n)∥≤C∥Φ(n)∥∥Ψ (n)∥,
where C := supn≥0,N∈N ∥An,N∥< ∞, and ∞
n=0 ∥Φ(n)∥∥Ψ (n)∥< ∞.
Hence, using the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain
lim
N→∞⟨Φ, A(N)Ψ⟩=
∞

n=0

Φ(n), AnΨ (n)
= ⟨Φ, AΨ⟩.
Hence,
| ⟨Φ, AΨ⟩| = lim
N→∞| ⟨Φ, A(N)Ψ⟩| ≤C∥Φ∥∥Ψ∥.
Therefore, ∥AΨ∥≤C∥Ψ∥, implying that A is bounded. Since ˆ⊕
∞
n=0Hn ⊂
D(A), D(A) is dense. To prove that A is closed, let D(A) ∋ΨN →Ψ ∈H,
AΨN →η ∈K as N →∞. Then, for each n ≥0, Ψ (n)
N
→Ψ (n) and
AnΨ (n)
N
→η(n) as N →∞. Since An ∈B(Hn, Kn), it follows that η(n) =
AnΨ (n). Hence, ∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 = ∞
n=0 ∥η(n)∥2 < ∞. Therefore, Ψ ∈
D(A) and AΨ = η. Thus, A is closed. In general, the domain of a densely
deﬁned closed bounded operator from a Hilbert space X to a Hilbert space
is equal to X . Hence, D(A) = H. Thus, A ∈B(H, K), and (4.10) holds.
(ii) Since strong convergence implies weak convergence, by part (i),
we need only to prove (4.11). For each Ψ ∈H, ∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 =
∞
n=0 ∥An,NΨ (n) −AnΨ (n)∥2. Under the present assumption, for all
n ≥0, limN→∞∥An,NΨ (n) −AnΨ (n)∥2 = 0. Moreover,
∥An,NΨ (n) −AnΨ (n)∥2 ≤2(∥An,NΨ (n)∥2 + ∥AnΨ (n)∥2) ≤4C2∥Ψ (n)∥2.
Hence, using the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain limN→∞
∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 = 0. Thus, (4.11) holds.
(iii) Since uniform convergence implies strong convergence, by part (ii)
(or (i)), we need only to prove (4.12). Let dN := supn≥0 ∥An,N −A∥. Then,
for all Ψ ∈H, we have ∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 ≤d2
N∥Ψ∥2. Hence, ∥A(N) −A∥≤
dN →0 (N →∞).

We now investigate how the properties of each An are related to those
of A. We ﬁrst consider the general case where Hn is not necessarily
equal to Kn.
Theorem 4.1.
(i) Let each An be densely deﬁned. Then, D(A) is dense in H and
A∗= ⊕∞
n=0An
∗.
(4.13)
(ii) Let each An be closed. Then, A is closed. Moreover, if each An has a
core Dn, then ⊕
∞
n=0Dn is a core for A.
(iii) If each An is unitary, then A is unitary.
(iv) If each An is a contraction operator, then A is a contraction operator.
(v) If each An is compact2 and limn→∞∥An∥= 0, then A is compact.
Proof. (i) We have ⊕
∞
n=0D(An) ⊂D(A). By the density of D(An) in Hn
and Proposition 4.1(ii), ⊕
∞
n=0D(An) is dense in H. Hence, D(A) is dense
in H. For all Φ = {Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(⊕∞
n=0An
∗) and Ψ ∈D(A), we have
⟨Φ, AΨ⟩=
∞

n=0

∞

n=0

An

= ⟨(⊕∞
n=0An
∗) Φ, Ψ⟩.
This implies that Φ
∈
D(A∗) and A∗Φ
=
(⊕∞
n=0An
∗) Φ. Hence,
⊕∞
n=0An
∗⊂A∗.
Conversely, Let Φ = {Φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(A∗) and Ξ := A∗Φ. Then, for all
Ψ ∈D(A), ⟨Ξ, Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, AΨ⟩. For each n ≥0, taking Ψ satisfying Ψ (m) = 0
for all m ̸= n, we have

Ξ(n), Ψ (n)
=

Φ(n), AnΨ (n)
. Since Ψ (n) is an
arbitrary element in D(An), it follows that Φ(n) ∈D(A∗
n) and A∗
nΦ(n) =
Ξ(n). Hence, ∞
n=0 ∥A∗
nΦ(n)∥2 = ∥Ξ∥2 < ∞, implying Φ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0A∗
n).
Hence, D(A∗) ⊂D(⊕∞
n=0A∗
n). Thus, (4.13) holds.
(ii) Let N ∈N, ΨN = {Ψ (n)
N }∞
n=0 ∈D(A), ΨN →Ψ ∈H, AΨN →Φ ∈
K (N →∞). Then, for each n, Ψ (n)
N
→Ψ (n), AnΨ (n)
N
→Φ(n) (N →∞).
By the closedness of An, Ψ (n) ∈D(An) and AnΨ (n) = Φ(n). Hence,
∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 = ∞
n=0 ∥Φ(n)∥2 = ∥Φ∥2 < ∞. Therefore, Ψ ∈D(A)
and AΨ = Φ. Thus, A is closed.

Let D = ⊕
∞
n=0Dn and (Ψ, AΨ) ∈G (A ↾D)⊥∩G (A). Then, for all Φ ∈D,
⟨Ψ, Φ⟩+ ⟨AΨ, AΦ⟩= 0. In particular, for all n ≥0 and φ ∈Dn,

Ψ (n), φ


AnΨ (n), Anφ

= 0. This means that (Ψ (n), AnΨ (n)) ∈G (An ↾Dn)⊥∩
G (An). Hence, by an application of Proposition 1.15, Ψ (n) = 0, AnΨ (n) = 0,
implying (Ψ, AΨ) = 0. Thus, by Proposition 1.15 again, D is a core for A.
(iii) Under the present assumption, Ran(An) = Kn, n ≥0. Hence,
by Proposition 4.4(ii), A is surjective. For all Ψ ∈H, we have ∥AΨ∥2 =
∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 = ∞
n=0 ∥Ψ (n)∥2 = ∥Ψ∥2. Hence, A is isometry. Thus, A
is unitary.
(iv) Under the present assumption, ∥An∥≤1, for all n ≥0. Hence, by
Proposition 4.5, ∥A∥≤1.
(v) Under the present assumption, for any ε > 0, there exists an N0 ∈N
such that, for all N ≥N0, ∥An∥< ε.
For each N ∈N, we deﬁne an inﬁnite direct sum operator A(N) =
⊕∞
n=0A(N)n by A(N)n := An for n = 0, . . . , N and A(N)n = 0 for
n ≥N + 1. Then, for all Ψ ∈H and N ≥N0,
∥A(N)Ψ −AΨ∥2 =
∞

n=N+1
∥AnΨ (n)∥2 ≤( sup
n≥N+1
∥An∥)2∥Ψ∥2
≤ε2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence, ∥A(N) −A∥≤ε, N ≥N0. Thus, u- limN→∞A(N) = A. Therefore,
we need only to prove that A(N) is compact.
Let {Ψm}∞
m=1 be any bounded sequence in H. Then, for all n ≥0,
{Ψ (n)
m }∞
m=1 is a bounded sequence in Hn. By the compactness of A0,
there exists a subsequence {m0(k)}k of {1, 2, . . .} such that {A0Ψ (0)
m0(k)}k
converges in H0. Then, by the compactness of A1, there exists a subse-
quence {m1(k)}k of {m0(k)}k such that {A1Ψ (1)
m1(k)}k converges in H1.
By repeating this procedure, one can construct a set of subsequences
{{mn(k)}k|n = 0, 1, 2, . . .} satisfying the following conditions: (a) for all
n ≥1, {mn(k)}k is a subsequence of {mn−1(k)}k ; (b) for all n ≥0,
{AnΨ (n)
mn(k)}k converges in Hn. Let Φk ∈H be such that Φ(n)
k
= Ψ (n)
mk(k),
k ≥1. Then, {Φk}k is a subsequence of {Ψm}∞
m=1 and, for all n ≥0,
{AnΦ(n)
k }k converges in Hn. Hence, {A(N)Φk}k converges. Thus, A(N) is
compact.
□
We next consider the case where Hn = Kn so that H = K.

Theorem 4.2. Let Hn = Kn, n ≥0.

ρ(A) ⊂∩∞
n=0ρ(An)

and
∪∞
n=0σ(An) ⊂σ(A).
(4.15)
(ii) Suppose that each An is closed and obeys
∥(An −z)−1∥≤
1
dist(z, σ(An)),
z ∈ρ(An),
(4.16)
where dist(z, σ(An)) denotes the distance between z and σ(An) (see
(1.66)). Then,
σ(A) = ∪∞
n=0σ(An).
(4.17)
Moreover, for all z ∈ρ(A),
(A −z)−1 = ⊕∞
n=0(An −z)−1.
(4.18)
(iii) Let
ρint :=

z ∈∩n≥0ρ(An) | sup
n≥0
∥(An −z)−1∥< ∞

Then, ρint ⊂ρ(A) and, for all z ∈ρint, (4.18) holds.
(iv) (point spectrum)
∪∞
n=0σp(An) = σp(A).
(4.19)
(v) Suppose that, for all n ∈Z+, An is symmetric. Then, A is symmetric.
Moreover, A is bounded from below with A ≥γ (γ ∈R) if and only if
{An}∞
n=0 is uniformly bounded from below, i.e., for all n ≥0, An ≥γ.
(vi) If each An is self-adjoint, then A is self-adjoint. Moreover, if each An
is essentially self-adjoint on Dn, then A is essentially self-adjoint on
⊕
∞
n=0Dn.
(vii) If each An is an orthogonal projection, then A is an orthogonal
projection.
Proof. (i) Let z ∈ρ(A). Then, Ran(A −z) is dense and A −z is injec-
tive with (A −z)−1 bounded. Hence, by Proposition 4.4(i), each An −z
202
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is injective. To prove that Ran(An −z) is dense, let φ ∈(Ran(An −z))⊥.
Then, for all ψ ∈D(An), ⟨(An −z)ψ, φ⟩= 0. Let Φ ∈H be such that
Φ(n) = φ and Φ(m) = 0, for m ̸= n. Then, it follows that, for all Ψ ∈D(A),
⟨(A −z)Ψ, Φ⟩= 0. Hence, Φ = 0, implying that φ = 0. Thus, Ran(An −z)
is dense. Since (A −z)−1 is bounded, there exists a constant C > 0 such
that ∥(A−z)Ψ∥≥C∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈D(A). This implies that, for any ψ ∈D(An),
∥(An −z)ψ∥≥C∥ψ∥. Hence, (An −z)−1 is bounded. Therefore, z ∈ρ(An),
for all n ≥0, i.e., z ∈∩∞
n=0ρ(An). Thus, (4.14) holds. Taking the comple-
ment relation of (4.14) gives (4.15).
(ii) In the present case, A is closed by Theorem 4.1(ii). Hence, by (4.15),
∪∞
n=0σ(An) ⊂σ(A).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let D := ∪∞
n=0σ(An)\ ∪∞
n=0σ(An).
Then, ∪∞
n=0σ(An) = D ∪[∪∞
n=0σ(An)]. Hence, we need only to show that
σ(A) ⊂D ∪[∪∞
n=0σ(An)]. This is equivalent to
ρ(A) ⊃Dc ∩[∩∞
n=0ρ(An)].
(4.20)
So, let us prove this inclusion relation. Let z ∈Dc ∩[∩∞
n=0ρ(An)]. Then, for
all n ≥0, An −z is bijective and (An −z)−1 is bounded. Moreover, there
exists a constant δ > 0 such that, for all n ≥0, infλ∈σ(An) |z−λ| ≥δ. Hence,
dist(z, σ(An)) ≥δ. Therefore, by (4.16), ∥(An −z)ψ ≥δ∥ψ∥, ψ ∈D(An).
Hence, by Proposition 4.4, A −z = ⊕∞
n=0(An −z) is bijective. Hence,
z ∈ρ(A). Thus, (4.20) holds. It is easy to see that (4.18) holds.
(iii) Let z ∈ρint. Then, by Proposition 4.5, the operator
Rz := ⊕∞
n=0(An −z)−1
is bounded. It is easy to see that (A −z)Rz = I and Rz(A −z) ⊂I. Hence,
z ∈ρ(A) and (A −z)−1 = Rz. Thus, the desired result follows.
(iv) Let λ ∈∪∞
n=0σp(An). Then, there is an n0 ≥0 such that
λ ∈σp(An0). Hence, there exists a non-zero vector ψ ∈D(An0) such that
An0ψ = λψ. Let Ψ ∈H be such that Ψ (n0) := ψ and Ψ (n) := 0, n ̸=
n0. Then, Ψ ∈D(A) \ {0} and AΨ = λΨ. Hence, λ ∈σp(A). Thus,
∪∞
n=0σp(An) ⊂σp(A).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(A). Then, there
exists a non-zero vector Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(A) such that AΨ = λΨ. This
implies that AnΨ (n) = λΨ (n), n ≥0. Since Ψ ̸= 0, there exists an n0 ≥0
such that Ψ (n0) ̸= 0. Hence, λ ∈σp(An0). Therefore, λ ∈∪∞
n=0σp(An).
Thus, σp(A) ⊂∪∞
n=0σp(An).

Suppose that A is bounded from below with A ≥γ (γ ∈R). Let ψ ∈

Hence, A is bounded from below with A ≥γ.
(vi) If each An is self-adjoint, then A∗
n = An. Hence, by Theorem 4.1(i),
A∗= A. Thus, A is self-adjoint. The statement on essential self-adjointness
of A follows from Theorem 4.1(ii).
(vii) The self-adjointness of A follows from (vi). Since supn≥0 ∥An∥≤1,
it follows from Proposition 4.5 that A is bounded with ∥A∥≤1. Hence, for
all Ψ ∈H and n ≥0, (A2Ψ)(n) = An(AΨ)(n) = A2
nΨ (n) = AnΨ (n), where we
have used A2
n = An, n ≥0. Therefore, A2 = A. Thus, A is an orthogonal
projection.

The following theorem is also interesting.
Theorem 4.3. Let Kn be a Hilbert space and An ∈L(Hn, Kn) (n ≥0) be
a densely deﬁned closed operator. Then,
A∗A = ⊕∞

nAn.
(4.22)
Proof. By the deﬁnition of the product of two linear operators, we have
D(A∗A) = {Ψ ∈D(A)|AΨ ∈D(A∗)}. It follows from this fact and (4.13)
that Ψ ∈D(A∗A) if and only if ∞
n=0 ∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞, Ψ (n) ∈D(A∗
nAn), n ≥0
and ∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞, ∞
n=0 ∥A∗

D(⊕∞
n=0A∗

n=0A∗
nAn)Ψ. There-
fore, A∗A ⊂⊕∞
n=0A∗
nAn. According to von Neumann’s theorem (see
Corollary B.1), A∗
nAn is self-adjoint. Hence, by part (vi), ⊕∞
n=0A∗
nAn is
self-adjoint. By Theorem 4.1(ii), A is closed. Hence, by von Neumann’s
theorem again, A∗A is self-adjoint. Since a self-adjoint operator has no
non-trivial symmetric extension (see Theorem 1.13), (4.22) follows.

Sum and Product of Two Inﬁnite Direct Sum Operators
So far, we have considered only a single inﬁnite direct sum operator. How-
ever, in applications, one may have the case where ﬁnitely many inﬁnite
direct sum operators are involved. In such a case, their sum or product
may be an interesting object.
Proposition 4.8. Let An, Bn ∈L(Hn, Kn) (n ≥0) and
A := ⊕∞
n=0An,
B := ⊕∞
n=0Bn.
Then:
(i) A + B ⊂⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
(ii) Suppose that, for some constant c > 0,
∥Anψ∥2 + ∥Bnψ∥2 ≤c(∥(An + Bn)ψ∥2 + ∥ψ∥2),
ψ ∈D(An) ∩D(Bn),
n ≥0.
Then,
A + B = ⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
(4.23)
(iii) If Bn ∈B(Hn, Kn) for all n ≥0 and supn≥0 ∥Bn∥< ∞, then (4.23)
holds.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(A + B) = D(A) ∩D(B). Then, ∞
n=0 ∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞,
∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞and ∞
n=0 ∥BnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞. Since
∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥2 ≤2(∥AnΨ (n)∥2 + ∥BnΨ (n)∥2),
it follows that ∞
n=0 ∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞. Hence, Ψ
∈D(⊕∞
n=0
(An + Bn)). It is easy to see that ((A + B)Ψ)(n) = (An + Bn)Ψ (n), n ≥0.
Hence, A + B ⊂⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
(ii) By (i), we need only to show that D (⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)) ⊂D(A + B).
Let Ψ ∈D (⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)). Then, for all n ≥0, Ψ (n) ∈D(An) ∩D(Bn)
and ∞
n=0 ∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞, ∞
n=0 ∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞. Under the present
assumption, ∥AnΨ (n)∥2, ∥BnΨ (n)∥2 ≤c(∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥2 + ∥Ψ (n)∥2), for
all n ≥0. Hence, it follows that Ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B) = D(A + B).

(iii) In the present case, B ∈B(H, K) by Proposition 4.5. Hence,
D(A + B)
=
D(A).
Therefore,
we
need
only
to
show
that
D (⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)) ⊂D(A). Let Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)). Then, for all
n ≥0,
∥AnΨ (n)∥≤∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥+ ∥BnΨ (n)∥≤∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥+ b∥Ψ (n)∥,
where b := supn≥0 ∥Bn∥. Hence, ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 ≤2(∥(An + Bn)Ψ (n)∥2 +
b2∥Ψ (n)∥2). This implies that Ψ ∈D(A).
□
Example 4.1. Let us consider the case where Hn = L2(R) for all n ≥0.
We deﬁne An and Bn by An := Dx (the generalized diﬀerential operator on
L2(R)) and Bn := (n + 1)αx (multiplication operator), with α > 2 being a
constant. Let f (n)(x) := e−(n+1)αx2/2, x ∈R. Then, f (n) ∈D(An) ∩D(Bn)
and
Anf (n) = −(n + 1)αxf (n),
Bnf (n) = (n + 1)αxf (n).
Hence, (An + Bn)f (n)
= 0. It is easy to see that ∞
n=0 ∥f (n)∥2
=
∞
n=0
√π/(n + 1)α/2 < ∞. Hence, f := {f (n)}∞
n=0 ∈D(⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn)).
However, since
∥Anf (n)∥2 = ∥Bnf (n)∥2 = c0(n + 1)α/2,
c0 :=

R
x2e−x2dx =
√π
2 ,
it follows that ∞
n=0 ∥Anf (n)∥2 = ∞
n=0 ∥Bnf (n)∥2 = ∞. Hence, f ̸∈D(A)
and f ̸∈D(B). Thus, in this example, A + B ̸= ⊕∞
n=0(An + Bn).
By Proposition 4.8(iii) and inductive arguments, one can easily derive
the following fact.
Corollary 4.2. Let k = 1, . . . , N (N ∈N) and A(k)
n

Proposition 4.9. Let An be a linear operator from Hn to Kn and Bn be
a linear operator from Kn to a Hilbert space Ln. Let A := ⊕∞
n=0An and
B = ⊕∞
n=0Bn. Then:
(i) BA ⊂⊕∞
n=0BnAn.
(ii) If each An is in B(Hn, Kn) with supn≥0 ∥An∥< ∞, then
BA = ⊕∞
n=0BnAn.
(4.24)
(iii) If there exists a constant c > 0 such that, for all n ≥0 and φ ∈D(Bn),
∥Bnφ∥≥c∥φ∥, then (4.24) holds.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(BA). Then, Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ ∈D(B). Hence, for
each n ≥0, Ψ (n) ∈D(BnAn) and

∥AnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞,

The ﬁrst and last properties imply that Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn). It is obvious
that (BAΨ)(n) = BnAnΨ (n), n ≥0. Thus, the desired follows.
(ii) We need only to show that D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn)
⊂
D(BA). Let
Ψ
∈
D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn). Then, for all n
≥
0, Ψ (n)
∈
D(BnAn) and
∞
n=0 ∥BnAnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞. Under the present assumption, D(A) = H.
Hence, Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ ∈D(B). Therefore, Ψ ∈D(BA).
(iii) Let Ψ ∈D(⊕∞
n=0BnAn). Then, ∞
n=0 ∥BnAnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞. Under
the present assumption, ∥BnAnΨ (n)∥2 ≥c2∥AnΨ (n)∥2, for all n ≥0. Hence,
∞
n=0 ∥AnΨ (n)∥2 < ∞. Therefore, Ψ ∈D(A) and AΨ ∈D(B). Thus, the
desired result follows.
□
Example 4.2. Let Hn, An, f (n) and f be as in Example 4.1. Let Cn :=
(n + 1)−αx−1 (multiplication operator) and C := ⊕∞
n=0Cn. It is easy to
see that, for all n ≥0, f (n) ∈D(CnAn) and CnAnf (n) = −f (n). Hence,
f ∈D(⊕∞
n=0CnAn). But f ̸∈D(A), as we have seen in Example 4.1. Thus,
CA ̸= ⊕∞
n=0CnAn.
4.4
Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Operators on H
Let H be as in (4.2) and, for each n ≥0, Pn be the orthogonal projection
onto the closed subspace Hn of H. We say that a linear operator T on H is
Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
207
diagonal if T is reduced by each Hn, i.e., for each n ≥0, PnT ⊂T Pn. In
that case, for all Ψ ∈D(T ) and n ≥0, PnΨ ∈D(T ) and T PnΨ = PnT Ψ.
Hence, (T Ψ)(n) = PnT Ψ = T Ψ (n) = TnΨ (n), where Tn is the reduced part
of T to Hn. Therefore. we have
T = ⊕∞
n=0Tn.
Hence, T is an inﬁnite direct sum operator on H. Conversely, all inﬁnite
direct sum operators on H are diagonal, as is easily seen.
Of course, there exist non-diagonal operators on H, which should also be
studied. In this section, we introduce a basic class of non-diagonal operators
on H, which has applications to mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds, and
a generalization of it.
4.4.1
Shift-type operators
Let A(n)
+
be a closed operator from Hn to Hn+1 (n ≥0). Then, we can
deﬁne a linear operator A+ on H as follows:
D(A+) :=
	
Ψ ∈H
 Ψ (n) ∈D(A(n)
+ ), n ≥0,
∞

n=0
∥A(n)

,
(A+Ψ)(0) := 0,
(A+Ψ)(n) := A(n−1)
+
Ψ (n−1),
n ≥1.
We call A+ the right shift operator associated with {A(n)
+ }n.
Theorem 4.4.
(i) The operator A+ on H is closed.
(ii) If D(A(n)
+ ) is dense for all n ≥0, then D(A+) is dense, and A∗
+ is
given as follows:
D(A∗

(iii) If each A(n)
+
is in B(Hn, Hn+1) and supn≥0 ∥A(n)
+ ∥< ∞, then A+ is
in B(H) and
∥A+∥≤sup
n≥0
∥A(n)
+ ∥.
Proof. (i) Let {ΨN}∞
N=1 be a sequence in D(A+) such that ΨN →Ψ ∈H
and A+ΨN →Φ ∈H (N →∞). Hence, Φ(0) = 0 and, for all n ≥1,
Ψ (n−1)
N
→Ψ (n−1) and A(n−1)
+
Ψ (n−1)
N
→Φ(n) (N →∞). Hence, by the
closedness of A(n−1)
+
, Ψ (n−1) ∈D(A(n−1)
+
) and A(n−1)
+
Ψ (n−1) = Φ(n). Since
∞
n=1 ∥Φ(n)∥2 < ∞, it follows that Ψ ∈D(A+) and A+Ψ = Φ. Thus, A+ is
closed.
(ii) The density of D(A+) follows from the fact that ⊕
∞
n=0D(A(n)
+ ) ⊂
D(A+) and Proposition 4.1(ii). Let D be the set on the right-hand side of
(4.25). Then, for all Φ ∈D and Ψ ∈D(A+),
⟨Φ, A+Ψ⟩=
∞

+
∗Φ(n+1), Ψ (n)
= ⟨η, Ψ⟩,
where η := {A(n)
+
∗Φ(n+1)}∞
n=0 ∈H. Hence. Φ ∈D(A∗
+) and A∗
+Φ = η. In
particular, D ⊂D(A∗
+). Conversely, let Φ ∈D(A∗
+). Then, for all Ψ ∈
D(A+),

A∗
+Φ, Ψ

= ⟨Φ, A+Ψ⟩. Taking Ψ = {δmnΨ (n)}∞
m=0 with Ψ (n) ∈
D(A(n)
+ ) arbitrary, we obtain

(A∗
+Φ)(n), Ψ (n)
=

Φ(n+1), A(n)
+ Ψ (n)
. This
implies that Φ(n+1) ∈D(A(n)
+
∗) and A(n)
+
∗Φ(n+1) = (A∗
+Φ)(n). Hence,
∞

n=0
∥A(n)
+
∗Φ(n+1)∥2 = ∥A∗
+Φ∥2 < ∞,
implying that Φ ∈D. Therefore, D ⊂D(A∗
+). Thus, the statement on A∗
+ is
proved. Formula (4.27) can be proved in the same way as we proved (4.22).
(iii) An easy exercise.

A general class of non-diagonal operators
For a pair (n, m) of non-negative integers, let Anm be a linear operator
from Hm to Hn. Then, one can deﬁne a linear operator A on H as follows:
D(A) :=
	
Ψ ∈H | for each n, m ≥0, Ψ (m) ∈D(Anm),

It is obvious that, in the case where An,n−1 = A(n−1)
+
for n ≥1 and
Anm = 0 for m ̸= n −1, one has A = A+. Hence, A is a generalization
of A+.

Inﬁnite Direct Sum Operator of Self-Adjoint Operators
We continue to study the inﬁnite direct sum operator A deﬁned by (4.5).
In this section, we concentrate our attention on the case where each An is
self-adjoint. In that case, A is self-adjoint (Theorem 4.2(vi)). Throughout
this section, we assume that Hn = Kn. We ﬁrst present fundamental facts
needed for the analysis of self-adjoint inﬁnite direct sum operators.
For each n ≥0, let E(n)(·) be a d-dimensional spectral measure on Hn
(d ∈N). Since E(n)(B) (B ∈Bd) is an orthogonal projection, it follows
from Theorem 4.2(vii) that the inﬁnite direct sum operator
E(B) := ⊕∞
n=0E(n)(B) (B ∈Bd)
of {E(n)(B)}∞
n=0 is an orthogonal projection.
Lemma 4.1. {E(B)|B ∈Bd} is a d-dimensional spectral measure.

210
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence, by Proposition 4.7, s- limN→∞E(B(N)) = E(B). By an appli-
cation of Corollary 4.2, we have E(B(N))
=
N
j=1 E(Bj). Hence,

In that case, C1 = C2.

It is easy to see that
⟨ΨN, E(B)ΨN⟩≤⟨Ψ, E(B)Ψ⟩, B ∈Bd.
Hence,

Rd f(λ)d ⟨ΨN, E(λ)ΨN⟩≤C1 < ∞, which implies that N

Rd f(λ)d

C2 ≤C1 < ∞. Thus, (4.29) holds.
Conversely, suppose that (4.29) holds. Then, for any N ∈N, the left-
hand side of (4.30) is less than or equal to C2. Hence,
aN :=

Rd f(λ)d ⟨ΨN, E(λ)ΨN⟩≤C2.
Since
⟨ΨN, E(B)ΨN⟩

⟨ΨN+1, E(B)ΨN+1⟩,
for
all

and

Rd f(λ)d ⟨Ψ, E(λ)Ψ⟩= C1. Hence, C1 ≤a ≤C2. Thus, (4.28) holds.
If one of (4.28) and (4.29) holds, then the above proof shows that
C1 = C2.

(4.31)
Proof. In the case where f ≥0, (4.31) is proved in the preceding lemma.
Let f be real-valued. Then, one can write f = f+ −f−, where f+(λ) :=
max{f(λ), 0}, f−(λ) := max{−f(λ), 0}, λ ∈Rd. It is obvious that 0 ≤
f±(λ) ≤|f(λ)|. Hence, f± satisfy (4.28) or (4.29) with f replaced by f±.
Therefore, (4.31) with f replaced by f± holds. This implies (4.31).
Finally, we consider a general f. Then, we write f = f1 + if2, where
f1 := Re f, f2 := Im f. Then, by the preceding result, (4.31) holds, with f
replaced by f1 and f2. Hence, (4.31) holds.

we obtain γ = μ, as desired.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In concluding this section, we state and prove an important theorem on
the direct sum of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 4.7. Let p ≥2 and An = (An1, . . . , Anp) (n ≥0) be a p-tuple of
strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on Hn, and deﬁne
Aj := ⊕∞
n=0Anj,
j = 1, . . . , p.
Then, A := (A1, . . . , Ap) is a p-tuple of strongly commuting self-adjoint
operators, and
EA = ⊕∞
n=0EAn,
(4.36)
where EA and EAn are the joint spectral measures of A and An, respec-
tively. Moreover,
σJ(A) = ∪∞
n=0σJ(An),
(4.37)
where σJ(·) denotes the joint spectrum.
Proof. By Theorem 4.5(ii), we have
EAj = ⊕∞
n=0EAnj.
Hence, for all j, k = 1, . . . , p, EAj and EAk commute. Therefore, A is
strongly commuting. It is easy to see that, for all Borel sets B1, . . . , Bp ⊂R,
we have
EA(B1 × · · · × Bp) = ⊕∞
n=0EAn(B1 × · · · × Bp).
Then, by a standard argument using Hopf’s extension theorem, one obtains
(4.36).
To prove (4.37), let
Sn := σJ(An),
S := σJ(A).
Then, (4.37) is written as S = ∪∞
n=0Sn.
Let λ ∈Sc. Then, since Sc is an open set in Rp, there exists a con-
stant δ > 0 such that Bδ(λ) := {λ′ ∈Rp| |λ′ −λ| < δ} ⊂Sc. Hence,
EA(Bδ(λ)) = 0. Therefore, by (4.36), EAn(Bδ(λ)) = 0, for all n ≥0.
This means that Bδ(λ) ⊂Sc
n. Hence, for all n ≥0, λ ∈Sc
n, imply-
ing that λ ∈∩∞
n=0Sc
n = (∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Hence, Sc ⊂(∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Therefore,
∪∞
n=0Sn ⊂S. Thus, ∪∞
n=0Sn ⊂S.
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈(∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Then, there
exists a constant ε > 0 such that Bε(λ) ⊂(∪∞
n=0Sn)c. Hence, for all n ≥0,
Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
215
EAn(Bε(λ)) = 0. Hence, by (4.36), EA(Bε) = 0. This implies that Bε(λ) ⊂
Sc. Hence, λ ∈Sc. Therefore, (∪∞
n=0Sn)c ⊂Sc. Hence, S ⊂∪∞
n=0Sn. Thus,
(4.37) holds.

Full Fock Spaces
We have so far considered a general theory of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert
spaces. We now introduce a special class of inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert
spaces, which plays a basic role in mathematical quantum ﬁeld theory.
Let {Hn}∞
n=1 be a sequence of Hilbert spaces. Then, one can deﬁne the
inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space
F := C ⊕

⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n
j=1Hj

.
We call it the Fock space associated with {Hn}∞
n=1. The subspace
⊗n
j=1Hj is called the n-particle Hilbert space of F. In the context
of quantum physics, ⊗n
j=1Hj describes states (state vectors) of n-quantum
particles. The Hilbert space F may be an abstract form which describes
a state space of a quantum system consisting of possibly inﬁnitely many
quantum particles.
In applications to quantum ﬁeld theory, the case where, for all n ≥1,
Hn is equal to a single Hilbert space H appears. In this case, F takes the
form
F(H ) := ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n H ,
with the convention ⊗0H
:= C. This Hilbert space is called the full
Fock space over H . As is seen, the full Fock space F(H ) is constructed
from the one-particle Hilbert space H with tensor product and direct sum
operations.
An application of Corollary 4.1 gives the following proposition.
Proposition 4.10. If H is separable, then F(H ) is separable.
A vector Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0 in F(H ) is called a ﬁnite particle vector
if there exists an n0 ∈N such that, for all n ≥n0, Ψ (n) = 0 (n0 depends
on Ψ). The set of all ﬁnite particle vectors in F(H ) is equal to
F0(H ) = ⊕
∞
n=0 ⊗n H ,
(4.38)
the algebraic inﬁnite direct sum of {⊗nH }∞
n=0. We call F0(H ) the ﬁnite
particle subspace of F(H ).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
There is a distinguished vector in F(H ), i.e., the vector ΩH
=
{Ω(n)
H }∞
n=0 deﬁned by
Ω(n)
H :=
	
1 for n = 0
0 for n ≥1
.
(4.39)
It is obvious that ΩH ∈F0(H ). As is seen from the deﬁnition, the vector
ΩH describes the state in which no quantum particle exists in the frame-
work of the full Fock space F(H ). In general, for a quantum system, a state
in which no quantum particle exists is called a vacuum. For these reasons,
ΩH is called the Fock vacuum in F(H ).
The Fock vacuum ΩH is a unit vector, i.e., ∥ΩH ∥= 1, and sometimes
written as ΩH = {1, 0, 0, . . .}.
We introduce an important subspace of the ﬁnite particle subspace. For
a subspace D of H , we deﬁne
Fﬁn(D) := ⊕

n=0(⊗
nD),
the
algebraic
inﬁnite
direct

of
algebraic

⊗
nD (⊗
0D := C). Obviously,
Fﬁn(D) ⊂F0(H ) ⊂F(H ).
Lemma 4.4. Suppose that D is dense in H . Then, Fﬁn(D) is dense in
F(H ).
Proof. Under the present assumption and Proposition 2.1(ii), ⊗
nD is
dense in ⊗nH , for all n ≥1. Hence, by Proposition 4.1(ii), Fﬁn(D) is
dense in F(H ).
□
Example 4.3. Let (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space, and consider the case
H = L2(X, dμ), where L2(X, dμ) is assumed to be separable. For each
n ∈N, let Xn := X × · · · × X (the n direct product space of X) and μn be
the n-product measure of μ on Xn. By Theorem 2.5, we have the natural
isomorphism ⊗nL2(X, dμ) ∼= L2(Xn, dμn). Hence,
F(L2(X, dμ)) ∼= ⊕∞
n=0L2(Xn, dμn),
where L2(X0, dμ0) := C.

The following proposition describes basic properties of T (n).
Proposition 4.11. Let T and T (n) be as above.
(i) The operator T (n) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on ⊗nH , and
(T (n))∗⊃(T ∗)(n).
(4.41)
(ii) If D ⊂D(T ) is a core for T, then ˆ⊗

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We set T (0) := 0 acting on C. The inﬁnite direct sum operator
dΓ(T ) := ⊕∞
n=0T (n)
of {T (n)}∞
n=0 is called the second quantization operator (or simply the
second quantization) of T . In this context, T is called a one-particle
operator.
By Proposition 3.2(ii), T
(n) = T (n), for all n ≥1. Hence,
dΓ(T ) = dΓ(T),
(4.42)
i.e., the second quantization of T coincides with that of T.
Example 4.4. We consider the case where H
=
L2(X, dμ), as in
Example 4.3. We denote by Un : ⊗nL2(X, dμ) →L2(Xn, dμn) (n ∈N)
the natural isomorphism (see Theorem 2.5). Namely, Un is a unique uni-
tary transformation from ⊗nL2(X, dμ) to L2(Xn, dμn) such that
Un ⊗n
j=1 fj = f1 × · · · × fn,
f1, . . . , fn ∈L2(X, dμ).
Let F be a measurable function on X such that |F| is a.e. ﬁnite with respect
to μ. Then, the multiplication operator on L2(X, dμ) by F is densely deﬁned
closed. We denote the multiplication operator by the same symbol F. We
take T to be F. Then, we have
UnF (n)U −1
n

n

j=1
Fj,
where Fj is the function on Xn deﬁned by
Fj(x1, . . . , xn) = F(xj),
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Xn, j = 1, . . . , n.
The operator
U := ⊕∞
n=0Un
with U0 := 1 is a unitary operator from F(L2(X, dμ)) to ⊕∞
n=0L2(Xn, dμn),
with L2(X0, dμ0) := C (U is the natural isomorphism mentioned in Exam-
ple 4.3). It follows that

It follows from the deﬁnition of ΩH and dΓ(T ) that
dΓ(T )ΩH = 0.
(4.43)
Hence, dΓ(T ) has eigenvalue 0:
0 ∈σp(dΓ(T )).
(4.44)
We now derive some general properties of dΓ(T ).
Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators

Theorem 4.8.
(i) The operator dΓ(T ) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on F(H ) and
dΓ(T ∗) ⊂dΓ(T )∗.
(4.45)
(ii) If T ̸= 0, then dΓ(T ) is unbounded.
(iii) Let D be a core for T . Then, Fﬁn(D) is a core for dΓ(T ).
(iv) If T is symmetric, then so is dΓ(T ). If T ≥0 in addition, then
dΓ(T ) ≥0.
(v) If T is symmetric and is not non-negative, then dΓ(T ) is not bounded
from below.
Proof. (i) The ﬁrst statement follows from Theorem 4.1(i) and (ii). By
Theorem 4.1(i), we have
dΓ(T )∗= ⊕∞
n=0(T (n))∗.
This formula and (4.41) imply (4.45).
(ii) In the case where T is unbounded, the unboundedness of dΓ(T )
follows from Proposition 4.6.
So, we next consider the case where T is bounded. In this case, each T (n)
is bounded. By the assumption T ̸= 0, there exists a unit vector ψ ∈D(T )
such that T ψ ̸= 0. Let Ψ (n) = ⊗nψ. Then, ∥Ψ (n)∥= 1 and
∥T (n)Ψ (n)∥2 = n(n −1)| ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩|2 + n∥T ψ∥2 ≥n∥T ψ∥2,
n ≥1.
By this estimate and the fact that ∥T (n)Ψ (n)∥2 ≤∥T (n)∥2, we obtain
∥T (n)∥≥√n∥T ψ∥. Hence, supn≥1 ∥T (n)∥= ∞. Thus, by Proposition 4.5,
dΓ(T ) is unbounded.
(iii) Under the present assumption, ⊗
nD is a core for T (n) (see Propo-
sition 3.2(ii)). Hence, by Theorem 4.1(ii), Fﬁn(D) is a core for dΓ(T ).
(iv) This follows from Proposition 4.11(ii)–(iii) and Theorem 4.2(v).
(v) Under the present assumption, there exists a vector ψ ∈D(T ) such
that ∥ψ∥= 1 and ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩< 0. In this case, for the vector Ψ (n) in (ii), we
have

Ψ (n), T (n)Ψ (n)
= n ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩.
Hence, letting Ψn = {0, 0, . . ., 0, Ψ (n), 0, 0, . . .} (note that ∥Ψn∥= 1), we
obtain
⟨Ψn, dΓ(T )Ψn⟩= n ⟨ψ, T ψ⟩→−∞(n →∞).
Hence, dΓ(T ) is not bounded from below.

the second half, let λ1, . . . , λn ∈σ(T ) (n ∈N). Then, λj ≥t0 (j = 1, . . . , n).

□
In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, dΓ(T ) may have the following
meaning. Suppose that T is a self-adjoint operator which denotes a physi-
cal quantity in a one-particle quantum system (e.g., the Hamiltonian and
the momentum operator). Then, T (n) represents the same kind of physical
quantity in the corresponding n-particle quantum system. Hence, dΓ(T )
gives the same kind of physical quantity in the corresponding inﬁnite quan-
tum particle system in which any number of quantum particles may exist.
The second quantization operator for the identity I on H ,

N := dΓ(I),
(4.47)
is called the number operator on F(H ). This name comes from the fact
that

N ↾H (n) = n,
n ≥0,
the scalar multiplication operator by n. Since I is self-adjoint, 
N is self-
adjoint by Theorem 4.9(i). By Theorem 4.9(iii) applied to the case of T = I,
one has
σ( 
N) = σp( 
N) = Z+,
(4.48)
with
ker( 
N −n) = ⊗nH ,
n ≥0.
(4.49)
In particular, 
N ≥0. Namely, 
N is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.
4.8
Ground State
Let T be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H . Then, by Theorem
4.9(iii), dΓ(T ) is non-negative and the inﬁmum of the spectrum of dΓ(T ) is
equal to 0, which is an eigenvalue of dΓ(T ); an eigenvector belonging to it is
given by the Fock vacuum ΩH (see (4.43)). From a general mathematical
point of view, this structure can be regarded as a concrete realization of a
general concept, which we recall in the following.
Let H be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space X , and suppose
that H is bounded from below. Then, by Theorem 1.14(iv), the inﬁmum of
the spectrum of H
E0(H) := inf σ(H)
(4.50)
222
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is ﬁnite. In the context of quantum physics, where H denotes the Hamilto-
nian of a quantum system, E0(H) is called the lowest energy of H. We
remark that E0(H) is not necessarily an eigenvalue of H. If E0(H) is an
eigenvalue of H, then H is said to have a ground state, and each non-zero
vector Ψ0 in the eigenspace ker(H−E0(H)) (i.e., Ψ0 ∈D(H)\{0} and HΨ0 =
E0(H)Ψ0) is called a ground state of H. In this case, the eigenvalue E0(H)
is called the ground state energy of H. If dim ker(H −E0(H)) = 1, then
the ground state of H is said to be unique.4 If dim ker(H −E0(H)) ≥2,
then the ground state of H is said to be degenerate. In quantum ﬁeld the-
ory, a ground state is sometimes called a vacuum.
The notion “ground state” originally comes from quantum mechanics;
a ground state is an eigenstate (eigenvector) with the minimum eigenvalue
of the Hamiltonian of a quantum system. However, in the deﬁnitions here, H
does not necessarily represent a Hamiltonian; they apply to all self-adjoint
operators bounded from below (an extension is made for the use of terms).
With the deﬁnition above, one can say that ΩH is a ground state of
dΓ(T ), with the ground state energy being zero.
4.9
Γ-Operators
Let K be a Hilbert space and S be a densely deﬁned closable operator
from H to K . Then the n-fold tensor product ⊗nS of S (⊗1S := S) is
a densely deﬁned closed operator from ⊗nH to ⊗nK (see Remark 3.8).
Hence, by Theorem 4.1(i) and (ii), the inﬁnite direct sum operator
Γ(S) := ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n S
(4.51)
with ⊗0S := 1 : C →C is a densely deﬁned closed operator from F(H )
to F(K ). We call the operator Γ(S) the Γ-operator for S.5 By (3.9), we
have
Γ(S) = Γ(S).
4With regard to the existence and uniqueness of ground states, some general theories
are known. See, for example, Glimm and Jaﬀe (1970), Simon and Hoegh-Krohn (1972),
Farris (1972), Gross (1972) and Miyao (2010). Textbook descriptions on this topic are
found in Reed and Simon (1978), Section XIII.12.
5Usually Γ(S) is considered only for the case where S is a contraction operator and
there are cases where Γ(S) is called the second quantization of S (e.g., Mayer, 1995,
Section 4.1). But, in the present book, we use the word “second quantization” only for
dΓ(·). In Arai (2000a), Γ(S) is called the second quantization of the second kind.

We ﬁrst note the following fact:
Proposition 4.12. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closed operators from
H to K . If Γ(S) = Γ(T ), then S = T .
Proof. We need only to apply Proposition 4.3.
□
Remark 4.4. The correspondence Γ(·) : S →Γ(S) deﬁnes a mapping
from the set of densely deﬁned closed operators from H to K to the set of
densely deﬁned closed operators from F(H ) to F(K ). Proposition 4.12
shows that this mapping is injective.
With regard to boundedness or unboundedness of a Γ-operator, the fol-
lowing theorem holds. Note the diﬀerence from those of the second quanti-
zation dΓ(·).
Theorem 4.10. Let S be a densely deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
(i) If S is unbounded or bounded with ∥S∥> 1, then Γ(S) is unbounded.
(ii) If S is a contraction operator, then so is Γ(S).
Proof. (i) Let S be unbounded. Then ⊗1S = S is unbounded. Hence, by
Proposition 4.6, Γ(S) is unbounded.
Next let S be bounded with ∥S∥> 1. Then ⊗nS is bounded for all
n ≥1 with
∥⊗n S∥= ∥S∥n.
(4.52)
The present assumption ∥S∥> 1 implies that supn≥1 ∥S∥n = ∞. Hence
supn≥1 ∥⊗n S∥= ∞. Thus, by Proposition 4.5, Γ(S) is unbounded.
(ii) If ∥S∥≤1, then, by (4.52), ∥⊗n S∥≤1. Hence, by Proposition 4.5,
∥Γ(S)∥≤1.
□
The next theorem is about the adjoint of Γ(S).
Theorem 4.11. Let S be as in Theorem 4.10.
(i) Γ(S∗) ⊂Γ(S)∗.
(ii) If S is a contraction operator, then Γ(S)∗= Γ(S∗).
(iii) If D is a core for S, then ⊕
∞
n=0 ˆ⊗
nD is a core for Γ(S).
Proof. (i) Since S is densely deﬁned closable, S∗is a densely deﬁned closed
operator. Hence one can deﬁne Γ(S∗). Let Ψ ∈D(Γ(S)) and Φ ∈D(Γ(S∗)).
224

Then Φ(n) ∈D(⊗nS∗) for all n ≥0 and ∞
n=0 ∥(⊗nS∗)Φ(n)∥2 < ∞. Recall
that ⊗nS∗⊂(⊗nS)∗. Hence
⟨Φ, Γ(S)Ψ⟩=

n=0

(⊗nS∗)Φ(n), Ψ (n)
= ⟨Γ(S∗)Φ⟩.
Therefore, Φ ∈D(Γ(S)∗) and Γ(S)∗Φ = Γ(S∗)Φ. Thus Γ(S∗) ⊂Γ(S)∗.
(ii) Under the present assumption, S∗is a contraction operator. Hence,
by Theorem 4.10(ii), Γ(S∗) is a contraction operator from F(K ) to F(H )
with D(Γ(S∗)) = F(K ). Thus, by (i), Γ(S∗) = Γ(S)∗.
(iii) By Proposition 3.1(i),
ˆ⊗
nD
is a core for ⊗nS. Hence, by
Theorem 4.1(ii), ⊕
∞
n=0 ˆ⊗
nD is a core for Γ(S).
□
Fundamental properties of Γ(S) are summarized in the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.12. Let S be as above.
(i) If H = K and S is self-adjoint, then Γ(S) is self-adjoint.
(ii) (product law) If S ∈B(H , K ) is a contraction operator and S′ is a
contraction operator from K to a Hilbert space M , then
Γ(S′S) = Γ(S′)Γ(S).
(4.53)
(iii) If U : H
→K is unitary, then Γ(U) is a unitary operator from
F(H ) to F(K ) and
Γ(U)−1 = Γ(U −1).
(4.54)
Moreover,
Γ(U)Fﬁn(H ) = Fﬁn(K ).
(4.55)
(iv) If S, SN (N ∈N) are contraction operators from H
to K
and
s- limN→∞SN = S, then
s- lim
N→∞Γ(SN) = Γ(S).
(v) Let H = K and M be a closed subspace of H . Let PM be the orthog-
onal projection onto M . Then Γ(PM ) is the orthogonal projection onto
F(M ) ⊂F(H ).
Proof. (i) Under the present assumption, ⊗nS is self-adjoint. Hence, by
Theorem 4.5(i), Γ(S) is self-adjoint.
(ii) Under the present assumption, Γ(S) and Γ(S′) are contraction oper-
ators by Theorem 4.10(ii). Since S′S is contraction operator, Γ(S′S) is a

225
contraction operator. It is easy to see that (4.53) holds on Fﬁn(H ). By
this fact and the density of Fﬁn(H ), operator equality (4.53) follows (an
application of Theorem 1.1).
(iii) If U is unitary, then ⊗nU is unitary. Hence, by Theorem 4.1(iii),
Γ(U) is unitary. By (4.53), we have Γ(IK ) = Γ(UU −1) = Γ(U)Γ(U −1). It
is obvious that Γ(IK ) = IF(K ). Hence (4.54) holds.
Relation (4.55) immediately follows from the deﬁnition of Γ(S).
(iv) One needs only to apply Proposition 4.7 with An = ⊗nS, An,N =
⊗nSN.
(v) By (i) and (ii), Γ(PM ) is an orthogonal projection. It is easy to see
that, for each n ≥1, (⊗nPM )(⊗nH ) = ⊗nM . Hence Γ(PM )F(H ) =
F(M ).
□
Theorem 4.12 tells us that the operator Γ(U) with U : H →K unitary
is a natural isomorphism between F(H ) and F(K ).

Anti-Unitary Γ-Operators
A mapping W : H →K is called an anti-unitary operator if W is
anti-linear, RanW = K and ∥Wψ∥= ∥ψ∥, for all ψ ∈H .
Let W : H →K be anti-unitary. Then, using the polarization identity,
one can show that
⟨Wψ, Wφ⟩= ⟨φ, ψ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H .
In the same way as in the case of bounded linear operators, one can show
that, for each n ∈N, there exists a unique anti-unitary operator ⊗nW from
⊗nH to ⊗nK such that
(⊗nW)(⊗n
j=1ψj) = ⊗n
j=1Wψj,
ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n.
We call ⊗nW the n-fold tensor product of W.
Let JC : C →C be the complex conjugation:
JCz := z∗,
z ∈C
and
Γ(W) := JC ⊕(⊕∞
n=1 ⊗n W).
Then, it is easy to see that Γ(W) is an anti-unitary operator from F(H )
to F(K ).

Representations of Unitary Groups and Semi-Groups
Let U(H ) be the set of all unitary operators on a Hilbert space H . Then,
it is easy to see that U(H ) is a group with respect to the product operation
of operators. The group U(H ) is called the unitary group on H .
Theorem 4.13. Let U0 be a subgroup of U(H ). Then, the mapping Γ(·):
U0 ∋U →Γ(U) ∈U(F(H )) gives a faithful unitary representation of U0
on F(H ).
In particular, if U0 is closed in the strong topology, then Γ(·) is strongly
continuous.
Proof. The ﬁrst half of this theorem follows from Theorem 4.12(ii), (iii)
and Remark 4.4. The second half is due to Theorem 4.12(iv).
□
Theorem 4.13 is used for the unitary representations of groups appearing
in quantum ﬁeld theory in the following form.
Corollary 4.3. Let G be a group and ρ : G →U(H ) be a unitary represen-
tation. Then, {Γ(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a unitary representation of G on F(H ).
In particular, if G is a topological space and ρ is strongly continuous, then
{Γ(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a strongly continuous unitary representation.
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 4.13 to the case where U0 =
{ρ(g)|g ∈G}.
□
For a Hilbert space H , we denote by Con(H ) the set of all contrac-
tion operators on H . It is easy to see that Con(H ) is a semi-group (see
Section 2.9.2), with the unit element being IH .
Theorem 4.14. Let B be a subsemi-group of Con(H ). Then, {Γ(C)|
C ∈B} is a subsemi-group of Con(F(H )).
Proof. Let C1, C2 ∈B. Then, by Theorem 4.12 (ii), Γ(Cj) (j = 1, 2) is a
contraction operator and Γ(C1C2) = Γ(C1)Γ(C2). Thus, the desired result
follows.

Relations Between Γ(·) and dΓ(·)
The following is an interesting relation between Γ(·) and dΓ(·).

Theorem 4.15. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H .
(i) For all t ∈R,
Γ(eitT ) = eitdΓ(T ).
(4.56)
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓ(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+ (see (1.77)),
Γ(e−zT ) = e−zdΓ(T ).
(4.57)
Proof. (i) By Theorem 4.6(i), we have for all t ∈R,
eitdΓ(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0eitT (n).
On the other hand, by Theorem 3.8(v),
eitT (n) = ⊗neitT ,
t ∈R.
Hence, (4.56) follows.
(ii) Let T ≥0. Then, by Theorem 3.8(iv), T (n) ≥0, n ≥0. Hence, by
Theorem 4.6(ii), dΓ(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+,
e−zdΓ(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0e−zT (n).
On the other hand, by Theorem 3.15, we have
e−zT (n) = ⊗ne−zT ,
t ≥0.
Hence, (4.57) follows.
□
Remark 4.5. See Problem 9 for some aspects of Theorem 4.15.
One has the following theorem on the transformation law of dΓ(T ) under
the unitary operator Γ(U), with U : H →K being unitary.
Theorem 4.16. Let U be a unitary operator from H to K and T be a
self-adjoint operator on H . Then,
Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = dΓ(UT U −1).
(4.58)
Proof. Since Γ(U) is unitary, Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 is a self-adjoint operator
on F(K ). Let t ∈R be arbitrary. Then, using the unitary covariance of
228
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
functional calculus (Theorem 1.32) and (4.56) and the product law of the
Γ-operation, we can proceed as follows:
eitΓ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = Γ(U)eitdΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = Γ(UeitT U −1) = Γ(eitUT U−1)
= eitdΓ(UT U−1).
Hence, (4.58) holds.
□
Remark 4.6. For Hilbert spaces H and K , we denote by Con(H , K )
the set of all contraction operators from H to K . Let H be a class of all
Hilbert spaces and C := {S ∈Con(H , K )|H , K ∈H}, the class of all
contraction operators from one Hilbert space to another. Then, the pair
Hilbert(C) := (H, C) forms a category whose class of objects and arrows
(morphisms) are H and C, respectively.6 One can also consider the category
whose objects and arrows are, respectively, full Fock spaces and contraction
operators from a full Fock space to a full Fock space. We denote it by
Fock(C). Then, it follows from Theorem 4.12(ii) that the correspondence
Γ : Hilbert(C) →Fock(C), deﬁned by
Γ(H , S) := (F(H ), Γ(S)),
(H , S) ∈Hilbert(C),
is a covariant functor. Hence, the Γ-operator Γ(·) in its extended form Γ(·)
is a covariant functor from a Hilbert space category Hilbert(C) to a full
Fock space category Fock(C).
By Theorem 4.15, the operator family {Γ(eitT )}t∈R with a self-adjoint
operator T is equal to the strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group
{eitdΓ(T )}t∈R generated by dΓ(T ). Hence, Γ(eitT ) is an integrated form of
the second quantization dΓ(T ) in the sense that, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓ(T )),
Ψ(t) = Γ(eitT )Ψ is a unique solution to the strong diﬀerential equation
dΨ(t)
dt
= idΓ(T )Ψ(t).
In this sense, it may be possible to regard Γ(eitT ) as a bounded operator
version of the second quantization of T . Thus, conceptually, the second
quantization may be understood as the functor Γ(·), with arrows restricted
to {eitT |t ∈R, T being a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space}.
Theorem 4.16 extends to the case where T is a densely deﬁned closable
operator.
6An introduction to category theory is found, for example, in Mac Lane (1986),
Section 11.9, and Awodey (2010).

Theorem 4.17. Let U be a unitary operator from H to K and T be a
densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then,
Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 = dΓ(UT U −1).
(4.59)
Proof. Let S := UT U −1. Then, by direct computations, one has for all
n ≥1,
S(n)
0
= (⊗nU)T (n)
0
(⊗nU −1)
on ˆ⊗
nD(S).
Hence,
S(n)
0
⊂(⊗nU)T (n)
0
(⊗nU −1) ⊂(⊗nU)T (n)(⊗nU −1)
= Γ(U)(n)dΓ(T )(n)Γ(U −1)(n).
Therefore,
S(n) ⊂Γ(U)(n)dΓ(T )(n)Γ(U −1)(n).
This implies that
dΓ(UT U −1) = dΓ(S) ⊂Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U −1) = Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1.
Since this relation holds for any densely deﬁned closable operator T and
any unitary operator U : H →K , one can take (UT U −1, U −1) as (T, U)
(note that UT U −1 is a densely deﬁned closable operator from K to H )
to obtain dΓ(T ) ⊂Γ(U)−1dΓ(UT U −1)Γ(U). Hence, by Proposition 1.1,
Γ(U)dΓ(T )Γ(U)−1 ⊂dΓ(UT U −1). Thus, (4.59) follows.

Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fﬁn(D([S, T ])) be of the following form:
Ψ (n) = ⊗n
j=1Ψ (n)
j

n ≥1,
Ψ (n)
j

hence
Ψ

D([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )]), with
([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )]Ψ)(n) = [S(n), T (n)]Ψ (n).
Using the deﬁnitions of S(n) and T (n), we have

By symmetry, T (n)S(n)Ψ (n) is given by the right-hand side with S and T
interchanged. Hence, it follows that
[S(n), T (n)]Ψ (n) = [S, T ](n)Ψ (n) = (dΓ([S, T ])Ψ)(n).
Thus, (4.61) holds.
□
To acquire a meaning of commutation relation (4.61), we recall some
algebraic concepts. Let K be R or C. A vector space g over K is called a
Lie algebra over K if there is a mapping [ , ] : g×g →g ((X, Y ) ∈g×g →
[X, Y ] ∈g) satisfying the following (i)–(iii):
(i) (linearity) [aX + bY, Z] = a[X, Z] + b[Y, Z], X, Y ∈g, a, b ∈K,
(ii) (anti-symmetry) [X, Y ] = −[Y, X], X, Y ∈g.
(iii) (Jacobi identity) [X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z, X]] + [Z, [X, Y ]] = 0, X, Y, Z ∈g.
If K = R (resp., C), then g is called a real (resp., complex) Lie algebra.
The mapping [ , ] : g×g →g is called a bracket product, or Lie bracket.
A subset h of a Lie algebra g is called a subalgebra of g if it is a vector
subspace of g and, for all X, Y ∈h, [X, Y ] ∈h. In that case, h is a Lie
algebra.
Example 4.5. For a vector space V over K, we denote by gl(V ) the set of
all everywhere deﬁned linear operators on V (note that gl(V ) ⊂L(V )). It
is easy to see that gl(V ) is a Lie algebra over K, with the bracket product
given by the commutator [X, Y ] := XY −Y X, X, Y ∈gl(V ).
Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
231
In particular, for a Hilbert space H , the set B(H ) of all everywhere
deﬁned bounded linear operators on H is a Lie algebra, with the bracket
product being the commutator. This Lie algebra is a subalgebra of the Lie
algebra gl(H ).
For Lie algebras g and h over K, a linear operator f : g →h is called a
homomorphism from g to h if, for all X, Y ∈g, f([X, Y ]) = [f(X), f(Y )]
(i.e., f preserves the Lie algebraic structure). A bijective homomorphism
f : g →h is called an isomorphism. The Lie algebras g and h are said to
be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism f : g →h.
A homomorphism ϱ from a Lie algebra g to gl(V ) (i.e., for all X, Y ∈
g, a, b ∈K, ϱ(X) ∈gl(V ), ϱ(aX + bY ) = aϱ(X) + bϱ(Y ) and ϱ([X, Y ]) =
[ϱ(X), ϱ(Y )]) is called a representation of g on V . In this case, V is called
the representation space of g.
If V is a subspace of a Hilbert space H , then ϱ is called a Hilbert
space representation of g in H . If, for all X ∈g, ϱ(X) is bounded,
then ϱ is called a bounded representation of g in H . A Hilbert space
representation of g which is not bounded is said to be unbounded.
Now, let us return to Theorem 4.18. Note that, for all S ∈B(H ),
dΓ(S) can be regarded as an everywhere deﬁned linear operator on the
vector space Fﬁn(H ). Namely, dΓ(S) ∈gl(Fﬁn(H )). Therefore, Theorem
4.18 means that the mapping dΓ(·) : B(H ) →gl(Fﬁn(H )) gives a Hilbert
space representation of the Lie algebra B(H ) on Fﬁn(H ). By Theorem
4.8(ii), this representation is unbounded.
Corollary 4.4. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on H .
(i) If S and T commute on a subspace D ⊂D(ST ) ∩D(T S), then
Fﬁn(D) ⊂D([dΓ(S), dΓ(T )]),
(4.62)
and dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) commute on Fﬁn(D):
[dΓ(S), dΓ(T )] = 0
on Fﬁn(D).
(4.63)
(ii) Let 
N be the number operator deﬁned by (4.47). Then, Fﬁn(D(T )) ⊂
D([ 
N, dΓ(T )]) and
[ 
N, dΓ(T )]Ψ = 0
on Fﬁn(D(T )).
(4.64)
Proof. (i) This follows from the proof of Theorem 4.18.
(ii) One needs only to apply (i) to the case where S
= I and
D = D(T ) = D([I, T ]).
□

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In the case where S and T are self-adjoint, dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) are self-
adjoint (Theorem 4.9). Hence, one can ask when they commute strongly.
One should be careful about the following point: by Corollary 4.4, if S and
T commute, then dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) commute on Fﬁn(D([S, T ])). But dΓ(S)
and dΓ(T ) do not necessarily strongly commute.
With regard to the strong commutativity of dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ), the fol-
lowing beautiful fact exists.
Theorem 4.19. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H . Then, the
self-adjoint operators dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) strongly commute if and only if S
and T strongly commute.
Proof. Let s, t ∈R be arbitrarily ﬁxed. Then, by (4.56) and (4.53), we
have
eis dΓ(S)eit dΓ(T ) = Γ(eisSeitT ),
s, t ∈R.
(4.65)
Suppose that dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) strongly commute. Then, by Proposition
1.48, for all s, t ∈R, eis dΓ(S) and eit dΓ(T ) commute. By this fact and (4.65),
Γ

eisSeitT 
= Γ

eitT eisS
. Restricting this equation to H as a closed
subspace of F(H ), we obtain eisSeitT = eitT eisS. Hence, by Proposition
1.48 again, we conclude that S and T strongly commute.
Conversely, suppose that S and T strongly commute. Then, by Proposi-
tion 1.48 and (4.65), eis dΓ(S) and eit dΓ(T ) commute. Hence, by Proposition
1.48 again, dΓ(S) and dΓ(T ) strongly commute.

A special case of Theorem 4.19 takes the following form.
Corollary 4.5. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, 
N and dΓ(T )
strongly commute.
Proof. It is easy to see that I and T strongly commute. Hence, by (4.47)
and Theorem 4.19, the desired result holds.

Creation and Annihilation Operators
Besides second quantization operators and Γ-operators, there are important
classes of linear operators on F(H ).
For each f ∈H and n ≥0, we deﬁne a mapping cn,+(f) : ⊗nH →
⊗n+1H by
cn,+(f)ψ := f ⊗ψ,
ψ ∈⊗nH .
(4.66)
Full Fock Spaces and Second Quantization Operators
233
It follows that
∥cn,(f)ψ∥= ∥f∥∥ψ∥.
Hence, cn,+(f) is a bounded linear operator with
∥cn,+(f)∥= ∥f∥,
and its adjoint cn,+(f)∗: ⊗n+1H →⊗nH satisﬁes
cn,+(f)∗⊗n+1
j=1 ψj = ⟨f, ψ1⟩⊗n+1
j=2 ψj,
ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n + 1.
(4.67)
For each f ∈H and a complex sequence α := {αn}∞
n=0 (αn ∈C, n ≥0),
one can deﬁne a linear operator ℓ+(f) on F(H ) as follows:
D(ℓ+(f)) :=

ℓ+(f)Ψ)(0) := 0,
(ℓ+(f)Ψ)(n) := αncn−1,+(f)Ψ (n−1),
n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(ℓ+(f)).
This is an example of the non-diagonal operator A+ introduced in Sec-
tion 4.4.1: in the present case, Hn = ⊗nH and A(n−1)
+
= αncn−1,+(f),
n ≥1. It follows that ℓ+(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on F(H )
with Fﬁn(H ) ⊂D(ℓ+(f)). The operator ℓ+(f) is called the creation
operator with test vector f. The adjoint of ℓ+(f)
ℓ(f) := ℓ+(f)∗
is called the annihilation operator with test vector f. By the closed-
ness of ℓ+(f),
ℓ+(f) = ℓ(f)∗.
Henceforth, we use ℓ(f)∗instead of ℓ+(f).
It follows from Theorem 4.4 that

With regard to the boundedness or unboundedness of ℓ(f), one has the
following proposition.
234
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proposition 4.13. Let f ∈H .
(i) If ∥α∥∞:= supn≥0 |αn| < ∞, then ℓ(f) is in B(F(H )) and
∥ℓ(f)∥= ∥α∥∞∥f∥.
(4.69)
(ii) If supn≥0 |αn| = ∞and f ̸= 0, then both ℓ(f) and ℓ(f)∗are unbounded.
Proof. (i) The boundedness of ℓ(f) with ∥ℓ(f)∥≤∥α∥∞∥f∥follows from
Theorem 4.4(iii). To prove (4.69), we need only to show that ∥ℓ(f)∥≥
∥α∥∞∥f∥. There is a sequence {n(k)}k (n(k) ∈N) such that |αn(k)| →
∥α∥∞(k →∞). Let ψf := ⊗n(k)f/∥f∥n(k) ∈⊗n(k)H , and deﬁne Ψk ∈
Fﬁn(H ) by Ψ (n)
k
:= 0, n ̸= n(k) and Ψ (n(k))
k
:= ψf. Then, ∥Ψk∥= 1 and
(ℓ(f)Ψk)(n) = 0,
n ̸= n(k) −1,
(ℓ(f)Ψk)(n(k)−1) = α∗
n(k)(∥f∥−n(k)∥f∥2) ⊗n(k)−1 f.
Hence,
∥ℓ(f)∥≥∥ℓ(f)Ψk∥= |αn(k)| ∥f∥.
Taking k →∞, we obtain ∥ℓ(f)∥≥∥α∥∞∥f∥.
(ii) In the present case, there exists a subsequence {αn(k)}k such that
|αn(k)| →∞(k →∞). Let Ψk be as in (i). Then, |αn(k)| ∥f∥≤∥ℓ(f)Ψk∥.
Hence, ∥ℓ(f)Ψk∥→∞(k →∞). Thus, ℓ(f) is unbounded. Then, the
unboundedness of ℓ(f)∗follows from a general fact (Proposition 1.10).
□
For vectors f, g ∈H , we deﬁne a mapping If,g on H by
If,g(ψ) := ⟨g, ψ⟩f,
ψ ∈H .
(4.70)
Lemma 4.5. For all f, g ∈H , If,g is a bounded linear operator on H
with ∥If,g∥= ∥f∥∥g∥.
The proof of this lemma is easy and hence left as an exercise (Problem 7).
Theorem 4.20. Let f, g ∈H . Then, for all Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)),
(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)Ψ)(0) = 0,

and, for all Ψ ∈D(ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗),
(ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = |αn+1|2 ⟨g, f⟩Ψ (n),

(4.73)
Proof. For all Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)), (ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)Ψ)(0) = 0 and
(ℓ(f)∗ℓ(g)Ψ)(n) = |αn|2cn−1,+(f)cn−1,+(g)∗Ψ (n),
n ≥1.
By considering the case where Ψ (n) = ⊗n
j=1ψj with ψj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n
ﬁrst and then by a limiting argument, one can prove the operator equality
cn−1,+(f)cn−1,+(g)∗= If,g ⊗I · · · ⊗I

n ≥0.
It is easy to see that
cn,+(g)∗cn,+(f) = ⟨g, f⟩.
Hence, (4.73) holds.
□
Example 4.6.
(i) A simple case for α is given by the case where αn = 1, n ≥0. Then,
for all f ∈H , ℓ(f) is bounded and ∥ℓ(f)∥= ∥f∥. Moreover, for all

ℓ(g)ℓ(f)∗= ⟨g, f⟩( 

where 
N is the number operator deﬁned by (4.47).
Finally, we derive commutation relations of ℓ(f)∗and ℓ(f) with the
second quantization dΓ(·).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 4.21. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H , f ∈
D(T ) and g ∈D(T ∗). Then,
[dΓ(T ), ℓ(f)∗] = ℓ(T f)∗
on Fﬁn(D(T )),
(4.74)
[dΓ(T ), ℓ(g)] = −ℓ(T ∗g)
on Fﬁn(D(T )).
(4.75)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fﬁn(D(T )). Then, (dΓ(T )ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(0) = 0 and, for all n ≥1,
(dΓ(T )ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = T (n)
0
(αnf ⊗Ψ (n−1))
= αnT f ⊗Ψ (n−1) + αnf ⊗(dΓ(T )Ψ)(n−1)
= (ℓ(T f)∗Ψ)(n) + (ℓ(f)∗dΓ(T )Ψ)(n).
Hence, (4.74) holds.
Replacing T by T ∗in (4.74), we have [dΓ(T ∗), ℓ(g)∗] = ℓ(T ∗g)∗on
Fﬁn(D(T ∗)). Hence, for all Φ ∈Fﬁn(D(T ∗)) and Ψ ∈Fﬁn(D(T )), we have
⟨Ψ, [dΓ(T ∗), ℓ(g)∗]Φ⟩= ⟨Ψ, ℓ(T ∗g)∗Φ⟩= ⟨ℓ(T ∗g)Ψ, Φ⟩.
It is easy to see that the left-hand side is equal to ⟨[ℓ(g), dΓ(T )]Ψ, Φ⟩. Hence,
[ℓ(g), dΓ(T )]Ψ = ℓ(T ∗g)Ψ. Thus, (4.75) follows.
□
It is perhaps worth remarking that commutation relations (4.74) and
(4.75) are independent of the choice of the sequence α.

Chapter 5
Boson Fock Spaces
There is an important closed subspace of the full Fock space F(H ) over a Hilbert
space H , called the boson Fock space over H . In this chapter, we describe
basic aspects of the theory of boson Fock spaces. This theory is a basis for
mathematically rigorous constructions of models in a class of quantum ﬁelds called
Bose ﬁelds.
5.1
Introduction: Some Physical Backgrounds
A
big
diﬀerence
between classical particles and quantum particles
(elementary particles, atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) is that identical quantum
particles (e.g., two electrons) are indistinguishable (e.g., Dirac, 1958, Chap-
ter IX). This fact is called the principle of indistinguishability. It places
some restrictions on the form of states of a many-body system consisting
of identical quantum particles.
To be concrete, let us consider a system S of N identical quantum
particles with N ≥2 (e.g., N electrons). Then, one can show (e.g., Arai
and Ezawa, 1999b, Section 4.1) that the principle of indistinguishability
implies the following alternative on the states of the system: any state of
the system S is either symmetric or anti-symmetric for all permutations
of the N identical quantum particles. A quantum particle is said to obey
the Bose–Einstein (resp., Fermi–Dirac) statistics if its many-particle
systems allow only symmetric (resp., anti-symmetric) states, called a boson
(resp., fermion). Thus, there are two classes of quantum particles in nature.
For example, electrons and protons are fermions, while photons and mesons
are bosons.
239
240
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
As is easily inferred, a Hilbert space of states for the system S may take
a diﬀerent form according to whether the quantum particles are identical
bosons or fermions. If a Hilbert space of states for a one-boson (resp., one-
fermion) system is H , then a natural Hilbert space of states for a system
of N identical bosons (resp., fermions) is given by the symmetric tensor
product ⊗N
s H
(resp., the anti-symmetric tensor product ∧N(H )) (see
Section 2.9.4 for the deﬁnition of these Hilbert spaces).
As is well known, elementary particles can be created or annihilated
through interactions. A quantum ﬁeld is supposed to be an object with
which one kind of elementary particles (quanta) is associated and that has
the function creating or annihilating the associated elementary particles
without restriction on their number. Hence, in the particle picture, the sys-
tem of a quantum ﬁeld is essentially an inﬁnite particle system. Therefore,
a Hilbert space of states for a quantum ﬁeld system must contain vectors
representing states of n identical elementary particles with n ≥0 arbitrary.
A quantum ﬁeld whose quanta are bosons (resp., fermions) is called a
Bose (resp., Fermi) ﬁeld. A boson Fock space, the main object in this
chapter, is used to describe a Hilbert space of states for the system of a
Bose ﬁeld. On the other hand, a Hilbert space of states for the system of
a Fermi ﬁeld is given by a fermion Fock space, discussed in the following
chapter.
In connection with these facts, we want to mention the following aspect:
a quantum particle carries a physical quantity called a spin angular
momentum s = (s1, s2, s3), where s1, s2 and s3 are linear operators on a
Hilbert space. This quantity is related to an internal degree of freedom.1
From a physical perspective, the spin angular momentum of a quantum
particle is supposed to be the angular momentum of “internal rotation.”
The total angular momentum of a quantum particle is given by the sum of
the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum.
A number s ∈{n/2 | n ∈Z+}—an integer (0, 1, 2, . . .) or a half-integer
(1/2, 3/2, . . .)—is associated with each quantum particle in such a way that
the eigenvalue of s2 is equal to s(s + 1)ℏ2, where ℏis the reduced Planck
constant. The number s is called the spin of the quantum particle under
consideration. In this case, the quantum particle is said to have spin s.
For example, an electron and a proton have spin 1/2. The spin of a
photon is 1. A π meson and a K meson have spin 0.
If the mass of a quantum particle with spin s is positive, then
the quantum particle has exactly (2s + 1) spin eigenstates, which are
1A degree of freedom independent of external (spatial) degrees of freedom.
Boson Fock Spaces
241
represented by eigenvectors of sj with eigenvalues −sℏ, (−s + 1)ℏ, . . . ,
(s −1)ℏ, sℏ. However, for elementary particles with mass zero, this is not
true. For example, a photon, whose spin is 1, has only two spin eigenstates
with eigenvalues ±ℏ; theoretically, this is due to relativistic and gauge
invariance (see, for example, Takeda and Miyazawa, 1974, Section 6.1 for
details).
In general, a quantum particle with an integer spin obeys the Bose–
Einstein statistics, i.e., it is a boson, while a quantum particle with a half-
integer spin obeys the Fermi–Dirac statistics, i.e., it is a fermion. This
experimentally established fact is called the relation of spin and statis-
tics. Theoretically, this can be derived from an axiomatic relativistic quan-
tum ﬁeld theory (e.g., Bogoliubov et al., 1975; Haag, 1996).
5.2
The Boson Fock Space over a Hilbert Space
Let H
be a Hilbert space. Then, for each n ∈N, one has the n-fold
symmetric tensor product Hilbert space ⊗n
s H (see Section 2.9). The inﬁ-
nite direct sum Hilbert space
Fb(H ) :=
∞

n=0
⊗n
s H
is called the boson (or symmetric) Fock space over H . Since ⊗n
s H is a
closed subspace of ⊗nH , Fb(H ) can be regarded as a closed subspace of
the full Fock space F(H ) in the natural way.
Let Sn (n
∈
N) be the symmetrization operator on ⊗nH
(see
Section 2.9) and S0 := 1 on ⊗0H = C. Then, by Theorem 4.2(vii), the
inﬁnite direct sum of {Sn}∞
n=0
Pb(H ) :=
∞

n=0
Sn.
on the full Fock space F(H ) is the orthogonal projection onto Fb(H ):
Pb(H )F(H ) = Fb(H )
The subspace
Fb,0(H ) := PbF0(H )
= {Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0 ∈Fb(H )|∃n0 such that
242
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Ψ (n) = 0 for all n ≥n0}
(5.1)
is called the ﬁnite particle (or boson) subspace of Fb(H ).
For a subspace D of H , we introduce
Fb,ﬁn(D) := Pb(H )Fﬁn(D) = ⊕
∞
n=0Sn(ˆ⊗
nD).
(5.2)
We call it the ﬁnite particle (or boson) subspace generated by D.
An element of the form αSn(f1 ⊗· · ·⊗fn) (α ∈C, fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n)
in Fb,ﬁn(H ) is called an elemental ﬁnite particle vector in Fb(H ).
Following the convention on the identiﬁcation of the nth Hilbert space
in an inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space,2 the nth Hilbert space ⊗n
s H in
Fb(H ) is identiﬁed with
F (n)
b
(H ) := {Ψ ∈Fb(H )|Ψ (m) = 0, m ̸= n}.
(5.3)
Then, we have the natural identiﬁcation
Fb(H ) = ⊕∞
n=0F (n)
b
(H )
(5.4)
In the context of Bose ﬁeld theories, F (n)
b
(H ) (or ⊗n
s H ) represents the
subspace of state vectors of n identical bosons. For this reason, F (n)
b
(H )
(or ⊗n
s H ) is called an n-boson space.
With regard to a CONS of Fb(H ), we have the following fact.
Proposition 5.1. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of H and E (n)
sym (n ∈N) be the
set deﬁned by (2.53) with N = n. Let ΩH be the Fock vacuum (see (4.39)).
Then, {ΩH } ∪[∪∞
n=1E (n)
sym] is a CONS of Fb(H ), where we use the natural
identiﬁcation of ⊗n
s H with 
⊗ns H ⊂Fb(H ) (see Section 4.1).
Proof. This follows from an application of Propositions 2.10 and 4.2.
□
Example 5.1. One of the simplest examples of boson Fock space is Fb(C),
the boson Fock space over C. Since ⊗n
s C ∼= C, we have

s L2(X, dμ)
is isomorphic to L2
sym(Xn, dμn) under the unitary transformation U sym
X,n,
deﬁned in Section 2.11.1. We deﬁne U sym
X,0 : C →C by U sym
X,0 = 1 and put

Boson Fock Spaces

L2
sym(X0, dμ0) := C. Then, by Theorem 4.1(iii), the inﬁnite direct sum
operator
U sym
X
:= ⊕∞
n=0U sym
X,n
is a unitary operator from Fb(L2(X, dμ)) to ⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dμn). Hence,
the boson Fock space Fb(L2(X, dμ)) over L2(X, dμ) is isomorphic to
⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dμn) under U sym
X
. We call this isomorphism the natural
isomorphism between Fb(L2(X, dμ)) and ⊕∞
n=0L2
sym(Xn, dμn) and write
Fb(L2(X, dμ)) ∼= ⊕∞

sym(Xn, dμn).

5.3
Boson Second Quantization Operators
In Chapter 4, we discussed second quantization operators acting on the full
Fock space F(H ). It is natural to consider the restriction of them to the
boson Fock space Fb(H ).
5.3.1
Reduction of a class of tensor product operators
As a preliminary, we ﬁrst discuss the reduction of a class of operators on
the n-particle space ⊗nH to the n-boson space ⊗n
s H .
Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
Proposition 5.2. For all n ≥2, the operator T (n) deﬁned by (4.40) is
reduced by ⊗n
s H .
Proof. We ﬁrst recall that the orthogonal projection from ⊗nH
onto
⊗n
s H is the symmetrization operator Sn. Let Ψ ∈D(T (n)) ⊂⊗nH . By the
deﬁnition of T (n), there exists a sequence {ΨN}∞
N=1 in ⊗
nD(T ) such that
ΨN →Ψ, T (n)ΨN →T (n)Ψ (N →∞). Hence, SnΨN →SnΨ, SnT (n)ΨN →
SnT (n)Ψ (N →∞). On the other hand, SnT (n)ΨN = T (n)SnΨN. Hence,
by the closedness of T (n), SnΨ ∈D(T (n)) and T (n)SnΨ = SnT (n)Ψ. Thus,
⊗n
s H reduces T (n).
□
We denote by T (n)
b
(n ≥2) the reduced part of T (n) to ⊗n
s H :
D(T (n)
b
) = D(T (n)) ∩(⊗n
s H ),
T (n)
b
Ψ = T (n)Ψ, Ψ ∈D(T (n)
b
).
(5.6)
We set T (0)
b
:= 0, T (1)
b
:= T. By Theorem 1.47(iv), for all n ∈Z+, T (n)
b
is
closed.

Since μk ∈σ(T ), it follows that, for each N ∈N, ET ((μk −1/N, μk +

such that φk,N :=
ET ((μk −1/N, μk +1/N))ΨN ̸= 0. Therefore, letting Φk,N := φk,N/∥φk,N∥,
we have ∥Φk,N∥= 1 and ∥(T −μk)Φk,N∥→0 (N →∞). Since μk ̸= μk′

5.3.2
Boson second quantization operators and their basic
properties
We are now ready to state and prove some facts on the reduction of a second
quantization operator dΓ(·) to the boson Fock space Fb(H ).
Theorem 5.1. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
(i) The second quantization dΓ(T ) is reduced by the boson Fock space
Fb(H ).
(ii) Let dΓb(T ) be the reduced part of dΓ(T ) to Fb(H ) (see Section 1.9) :
dΓb(T ) := dΓ(T )Fb(H ).
(5.9)
Then,
dΓb(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0T (n)
b
.
(5.10)
(iii) dΓb(T ∗) ⊂dΓb(T )∗.
(iv) If D is a core for T, then Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓb(T ).
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(dΓ(T )) and, for each N ∈N, deﬁne the vec-
tor ΨN as follows: Ψ (n)
N
= Ψ (n), n ≤N; Ψ (n)
N
= 0, n ≥N + 1. Then,
ΨN ∈D(dΓ(T )) and ΨN →Ψ, dΓ(T )ΨN →dΓ(T )Ψ (N →∞). Hence,
PbΨN →PbΨ, PbdΓ(T )ΨN →PbdΓ(T )Ψ (N →∞). On the other hand, by
Proposition 5.2, for all n ≥0,
(PbdΓ(T )ΨN)(n) = SnT (n)Ψ (n)
N
= T (n)SnΨ (n)
N
= (dΓ(T )PbΨN)(n).
Hence, PbdΓ(T )ΨN = dΓ(T )PbΨN. Therefore,
dΓ(T )PbΨN →PbdΓ(T )Ψ (N →∞).
By the closedness of dΓ(T ), PbΨ ∈D(dΓ(T )) and
dΓ(T )PbΨ = PbdΓ(T )Ψ.
(5.11)
Thus, dΓ(T ) is reduced by Fb(H ).
(ii) This is due to (5.11) and (5.6).
(iii) This follows from Theorem 4.8(i) and Proposition 1.51(iv).
(iv) This follows from Theorems 4.8(iii) and 1.47(iv).
□
Boson Fock Spaces
247
The operator dΓb(T ) is called the boson second quantization
operator, or the boson second quantization of T .
The Fock vacuum ΩH (see (4.39)) is also in Fb(H ), and (4.43) gives
dΓb(T )ΩH = 0.
(5.12)
Hence, ΩH is an eigenvector of dΓb(T ) with eigenvalue 0:
0 ∈σp(dΓb(T )).
(5.13)
In the context of Bose ﬁeld theory, with T being a one-particle
Hamiltonian, dΓb(T ) gives a general form of the Hamiltonian of a free
(non-interacting) Bose ﬁeld (see Chapters 9 and 10).
The following theorem summarizes the basic properties of dΓb(T ), with
T being self-adjoint.
Theorem 5.2. Let T be self-adjoint.
(i) dΓb(T ) is self-adjoint.
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓb(T ) ≥0.
(iii) If σ(T ) ∩(−∞, 0) ̸= ∅, then dΓb(T ) is not bounded from below.
(iv) If D ⊂H is a core for T p with some p ∈N, then Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core
for dΓb(T )p.
Proof. (i) This follows from Theorem 1.47(ix).
(ii) This follows from Theorem 4.8(iv).
(iii) This can be proved in the same way as we proved Theorem 4.8(v).
(iv) By Theorem 4.5(iii), we have
dΓb(T )p = ⊕∞
n=0(T (n)
b
)p.
Hence, applying Proposition 5.3(ii) and Theorem 4.1(ii), we obtain the
desired result.
□
Example 5.3. Let us consider the boson Fock space Fb(L2(X, dμ)) over
L2(X, dμ) (see Example 5.2). Let F be a real-valued measurable function
on X such that F(x) is ﬁnite for μ-a.e. x ∈X. Then, the multiplication
operator on L2(X, dμ) by the function F is self-adjoint (e.g., Arai, 1997a,
p. 97). We denote the multiplication operator by the same symbol F if there
would be no danger of confusion. It is easy to see that, for all n ≥1 and

5.3.4
eitdΓb(T )-invariant vectors
Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, by an application of Theorem
1.29(v), we have
{Ψ ∈Fb(H )|eitdΓb(T )Ψ = Ψ, t ∈R} = ker dΓb(T ).
(5.17)
By (5.12), ΩH ∈ker(dΓb(T )). Hence,
eitdΓb(T )ΩH = ΩH ,
t ∈R,
i.e., ΩH is an eitdΓb(T )-invariant vector.
Concerning the uniqueness of eitdΓb(T )-invariant vectors, the following
theorem holds.
Theorem 5.4. Let T be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on H such
that ker T = {0}. Then, if a vector Ψ ∈Fb(H ) satisﬁes eitdΓb(T )Ψ = Ψ
for all t ∈R, then Ψ = λΩH for some constant λ ∈C.
Proof. By (5.17), we need only to show that, under the present
assumption, ker dΓb(T ) = {λΩH |λ ∈C}.
Let Ψ ∈ker dΓb(T ). Then, dΓb(T )Ψ = 0. This implies that, for all
n ∈N, T (n)
b
Ψ (n) = 0. Since T ≥0 with ker T = {0}, it follows from Theorem
3.9 that, for all n ∈N, ker T (n)
b
= 0. Hence, Ψ = {Ψ (0), 0, 0, . . .} = λΩH
with λ = Ψ (0).
□
Remark 5.1. With regard to ker dΓb(T ) in the case where ker T ̸= {0},
see Theorem 7.7 in Chapter 7 in this book.
5.3.5
Boson number operator
We denote by Nb the reduced part of the number operator 
N = dΓ(I) on
the full Fock space F(H ) to Fb(H ):
Nb := 
NFb(H ).
(5.18)
250
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We call Nb the boson number operator on Fb(H ). It follows that
D(Nb) =

Ψ ∈Fb(H )

∞

n=1
n2∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞

,
(5.19)
(NbΨ)(n) = nΨ (n),
Ψ ∈D(Nb), n ≥0.
(5.20)
Hence,
Fb,0(H ) ⊂D(Nb).
(5.21)
As in the case of the number operator 
N on the full Fock space F(H ),
one has the following on the spectrum of Nb:
σ(Nb) = σp(Nb) = Z+,
(5.22)
ker(Nb −n) = ⊗n
s H ,
n ∈σp(Nb).
(5.23)
Hence, by Example 1.3, the spectral measure ENb of Nb is given by
ENb(B) =

n∈B
P (n)
b
,
B ∈B1,
(5.24)
where P (n)
b
is the orthogonal projection onto the n-boson space ⊗n
s H . In
particular, for each n ∈Z+,
ENb({n}) = P (n)
b
.
(5.25)
Hence, for all Borel measurable functions f on R such that |f(n)| < ∞,
n ∈Z+,
D(f(Nb) =

Ψ ∈Fb(H )

∞

n=0
|f(n)|2∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞

,
(5.26)
(f(Nb)Ψ)(n) = f(n)Ψ (n),
Ψ ∈D(f(Nb).
(5.27)
i.e.,
f(Nb) = ⊕∞
n=0f(n).
(5.28)
For all a ≥0 and α > 0, the function R ∋λ →(|λ| + a)α is contin-
uous and non-negative. Hence, by the functional calculus for Nb, which is
Boson Fock Spaces
251
a non-negative self-adjoint operator, (Nb + a)α is non-negative and self-
adjoint. By (5.28),
D((Nb + a)α) =

Ψ ∈Fb(H )

∞

n=0
(n + a)2α∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞

,
(5.29)
((Nb + a)αΨ)(n) = (n + a)αΨ (n),
Ψ ∈D((Nb + a)α).
(5.30)
From this representation, we obtain the following:
Proposition 5.4. For all a > 0 and α > 0, D((Nb + a)α) = D(N α
b ) and
∥N α
b Ψ∥≤∥(Nb + a)αΨ∥.
(5.31)
In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, for a state Ψ ∈Fb(H )
(∥Ψ∥= 1), the probability ∥ENb({n})Ψ∥2 of ﬁnding n bosons in Ψ (see
Remark 1.10) is given by
∥ENb({n})Ψ∥2 = ∥P (n)
b
Ψ∥2 = ∥Ψ (n)∥2.
(5.32)
5.3.6
Commutation properties
In this section, we describe commutation properties of boson second
quantization operators.
Theorem 5.5. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on H
such that D([S, T ]) is dense and [S, T ] is closable. Then, Fb,ﬁn(D([S, T ])) ⊂
D([dΓb(S), dΓb(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D([S, T ])),
[dΓb(S), dΓb(T )]Ψ = dΓb([S, T ])Ψ
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4.18 and the reducibility of dΓ(·) to
Fb(H ).
□
As a corollary to Theorem 5.5, we have the following fact.
Corollary 5.1. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then,
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([Nb, dΓb(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )),
[Nb, dΓb(T )]Ψ = 0.
In the case where S and T are self-adjoint, it is natural to ask when
dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly commute.
252
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 5.1. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, for all z ∈C,
eizdΓ(T ) is reduced by Fb(H ) and
(eizdΓ(T ))Fb(H ) = eizdΓb(T ).
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 1.49 with M = Fb(H ), f(λ) =
eizλ and A = dΓ(T ).
□
Remark 5.2. The operators eizdΓ(T ) and eizdΓb(T ) are not necessarily
bounded.
The following proposition gives an answer to the above question.
Proposition 5.5. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on H .
(i) dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly commute if and only if S and T strongly
commute.
(ii) Nb and dΓb(T ) strongly commute.
Proof. (i) Suppose that dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly commute. Then,
eis dΓb(S)eit dΓb(T ) = eit dΓb(T )eis dΓb(S),
s, t ∈R.
(5.33)
Restricting this equation to the one-particle space ⊗1
sH = H , we have
eisSeitT = eitT eisS. Hence, S and T strongly commute.
Conversely suppose that S and T
strongly commute. Then, by
Theorem 4.19, eis dΓ(S) and eit dΓ(T ) strongly commute for all s, t ∈R.
Hence,
eis dΓ(S)eit dΓ(T ) = eit dΓ(T )eis dΓ(S),
s, t ∈R.
By Lemma 5.1, this implies (5.33). Hence, dΓb(S) and dΓb(T ) strongly
commute.
(ii) It is obvious that S = I and T strongly commute. Hence, by part (i),
Nb and dΓb(T ) strongly commute.
□
5.4
Boson Γ-Operators
Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator from a Hilbert space H to
a Hilbert space K . In the same way as in Proposition 5.2, one can prove
that, for each n ≥2,
Sn(⊗nT ) ⊂(⊗nT )Sn.
(5.34)
Boson Fock Spaces
253
Hence, we can deﬁne a densely deﬁned closed operator (⊗nT )b from ⊗n
s H
to ⊗n
s K as follows: (⊗0T )b := 1, (⊗1T )b := T and, for n ≥2,
D((⊗nT )b) := D(⊗nT ) ∩(⊗n
s H ),
(⊗nT )bΨ := (⊗nT )Ψ,
Ψ ∈D((⊗nT )b).
In the case of H = K , (⊗nT )b is nothing but the reduced part of ⊗nT to
⊗n
s H .
Lemma
5.2. Let H , K
and T
be as above. Then Pb(K )Γ(T )
⊂
Γ(T )Pb(H ).
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(Γ(T )). Then, for all n ≥0, Ψ (n) ∈D(⊗nT ) and
∞

n=0
∥(⊗nT )Ψ∥2 < ∞. By (5.34), SnΨ (n) ∈D(⊗nT ) and (⊗nT )SnΨ (n) =
Sn(⊗nT )Ψ (n). Hence, it follows that Pb(H )Ψ ∈D(Γ(T )) and Γ(T )Pb
(H )Ψ = Pb(K )Γ(T )Ψ.
□
By Lemma 5.2, we can deﬁne a densely deﬁned closed operator Γb(T )
from Fb(H ) to Fb(K ) as follows:
D(Γb(T )) := D(Fb(H )) ∩D(Γ(T )),
(5.35)
Γb(T )Ψ := Γ(T )Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(Γb(T )).
(5.36)
Then, we have
Γb(T ) = ⊕∞
n=0(⊗nT )b.
Note that, if H = K , then Γb(T ) is the reduced part of Γ(T ) to Fb(H ).
We call the operator Γb(T ) the boson Γ-operator for T .
Remark
5.3. For an anti-unitary operator W
:
H
→
K
(see
Section 4.10), we deﬁne
Γb(W) = JC ⊕(⊕∞
n=1(⊗nW) ↾⊗n
s H )) .
It is easy to see that Γb(W) is anti-unitary.
We next derive some basic properties of the reduced Γ-operator Γb(·).
Theorem 5.6. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
(i) If T is unbounded or bounded with ∥T ∥> 1, then Γb(T ) is unbounded.
(ii) Γb(T ∗) ⊂Γb(T )∗.
254
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(iii) If T is a contraction operator, then Γb(T ) is a contraction operator
and
Γb(T )∗= Γb(T ∗).
(5.37)
(iv) If D is a core for T, then Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for Γb(T ).
Proof. (i) Let T be unbounded. Then, (⊗1T )b = T is unbounded. Hence,
by Proposition 4.6, Γb(T ) is unbounded. Next, let T be bounded with
∥T ∥> 1. Then, there exist a constant c > 0 and a unit vector f ∈H
such that ∥T f∥≥1 + c. Hence,
∥(⊗nT )b∥≥∥(⊗nT ) ⊗n f∥= ∥T f∥n ≥(1 + c)n.
Hence, supn≥1 ∥(⊗nT )b∥= ∞. Therefore, by Proposition 4.5, Γb(T ) is
unbounded.
(ii) This follows from Theorem 4.11(i) and Proposition 1.51(iv).
(iii) By Theorem 4.10(ii), Γ(T ) is a contraction operator. Hence,
∥Γb(T )∥≤∥Γ(T )∥≤1. Equality (5.37) follows from Theorem 4.11(ii).
(iv) This follows from Theorem 4.11(iii).
□
Theorem 5.7. Let H , K and X be Hilbert spaces.
(i) If T is self-adjoint on H , then so is Γb(T ).
(ii) If U : H →K is unitary, then so is Γb(U) : Fb(H ) →Fb(K ) and
Γb(U)−1 = Γb(U −1).
Moreover,
Γb(U)Fb,ﬁn(H ) = Fb,ﬁn(K ).
(iii) (product law) Let S ∈B(H , K ) and T ∈B(K , X ) be contraction
operators. Then,
Γb(T )Γb(S) = Γb(T S).
(iv) Let Tn, T, n ∈N be contraction operators from H to K satisfying
s- limn→∞Tn = T . Then,
s- lim
n→∞Γb(Tn) = Γb(T ).
(v) Let H
= K
and M be a closed subspace of H . Let PM be
the orthogonal projection onto M . Then, Γb(PM) is the orthogonal
projection onto Fb(M ) ⊂Fb(H ).
Boson Fock Spaces
255
Proof. These follow from Theorem 4.12 and the theory of reduction of
operators (cf. Section 1.9).
□
The basic relations between the boson second quantization operator
dΓb(T ) and the boson Γ-operator Γb(T ) are given by the following theorem.
Theorem 5.8. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H .
(i) For all t ∈R,
Γb(eitT ) = eitdΓb(T ).
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓb(T ) ≥0 and, for all z ∈C+,
Γb(e−zT ) = e−zdΓb(T ).
Proof. This theorem follows from Theorems 4.15 and 1.49.
□
Theorem 5.9. Let U : H →K (a Hilbert space) be a unitary operator
and T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H . Then,
Γb(U)dΓb(T )Γb(U)−1 = dΓb(UT U −1).
(5.38)
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4.17 and Proposition 1.54.
□
Theorem 4.13 and Corollary 4.3 immediately yield the following results
on unitary representations of a group on Fb(H ).
Theorem 5.10. Let U0 be a subgroup of U(H ) which is closed in the strong

faithful strongly continuous unitary representation of U0 on Fb(H ).
Corollary 5.2. Let G be a group and ρ : G →U(H ) be a unitary represen-
tation. Then, {Γb(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a unitary representation of G on Fb(H ).
In particular, if G is a topological space and ρ is strongly continuous, then
{Γb(ρ(g))|g ∈G} is a strongly continuous unitary representation.

Trace of Γb-Operator
Theorem 5.11(ii) suggests that the trace of Γb(T ) may give an interesting
result.
Theorem 5.12. Assume that H is separable and T is a non-negative trace
class operator such that σ(T ) \ {0} = σd(T ) = {λn}∞
n=1 and supn≥1 λn < 1
counting multiplicity. Then, Γb(T ) is trace class and
Tr Γb(T ) =

n=1(1 −λn).
(5.39)
Proof. Without loss of generality, one can assume that 0 < · · · ≤λn+1 ≤
λn ≤· · · λ2 ≤λ1 < 1. Let en be an eigenvector of T with eigenvalue

Corollary 5.3. Under the same assumption as in Theorem 5.12, for all
z ∈C such that |z| ≤1, Γb(z)Γb(T ) and Γb(zT ) are trace classes and

∞
n=1(1 −zλn).
(5.42)
Boson Fock Spaces
259
Proof. Since |z| ≤1, Γb(z) is in B(Fb(H )). Hence, Γb(z)Γb(T ) is a trace
class by Proposition 1.24. Using the product law of Γb-operator, we have
Γb(z)Γb(T ) = Γb(zT ). Hence, Γb(zT ) is a trace class and
Tr Γb(z)Γb(T ) = Tr Γb(zT ).
Let z ̸= 0. Then, it is obvious that σd(zT ) \ {0} = {zλn}n≥1 and (zT )en =

Then, in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 5.12, one can derive

projection onto {αΩH |α ∈C}. Hence, Tr Γb(0) = 1. Hence, in this case
too, (5.42) holds.
□
The special case of z = eiθ in Γb(z) (θ ∈R) may be interesting. By
Theorem 5.8(i) and dΓb(I) = Nb, we have
Γb(eiθ) = eiθNb.
Hence, we obtain the following results.
Corollary 5.4. Under the same assumption as in Theorem 5.12, eiθNb
Γb(T ) is a trace class for all θ ∈R and
Tr eiθNbΓb(T ) =

with E1 ≤E2 ≤· · · ≤En ≤En+1 ≤· · · and En →∞(n →∞), counting
multiplicity, and ∞

Tr eiθNbe−βdΓb(T ) =
1
∞
n=1(1 −e−βEn+iθ).
(5.43)
Proof. The condition ∞
n=1 e−βEn implies that e−βT is a non-negative
trace class operator with eigenvalues {e−βEn}∞
n=1. Hence, applying Corol-
lary 5.4 to the case where T is replaced by e−βT , we obtain the desired
result.

Remark 5.4. In the context of quantum statistical mechanics, the function

Boson Annihilation and Creation Operators
In Section 4.14, we introduced annihilation and creation operators acting
in the full Fock space F(H ). In this section, we study their realizations in
the boson Fock space.
5.7.1
Deﬁnitions and basic properties
Let ℓ(f) and ℓ(f)∗be, respectively, the annihilation operator and the
creation operator on the full Fock space F(H ) with f
∈H
(see
Section 4.14). We specialize the complex sequence α = {αn}∞
n=0 in
Section 4.14 to the following case:
αn = √n,
n ≥0.
Then, ℓ(f) and ℓ(f)∗take the following forms:
(ℓ(f)Ψ)(n) =
√
n + 1cn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1),
n ≥0, Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)),
(5.44)
(ℓ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = √ncn,+(f)Ψ (n−1)
= √n f ⊗Ψ (n−1),
n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(ℓ(f)∗).
(5.45)
One can easily infer from (5.45) that an operator acting in Fb(H ) corre-
sponding to ℓ(f)∗is deﬁned as follows:
D(A†(f)) :=

Ψ ∈Fb(H )|
∞

n=0
∥√nSn(f ⊗Ψ (n−1))∥2 < ∞

, (5.46)
(A†(f)Ψ)(0) = 0,
(5.47)
(A†(f)Ψ)(n) := √nSn(f ⊗Ψ (n−1)),
n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(A†(f)).
(5.48)
It follows that
A†(f) ⊃Pb(H )ℓ(f)∗↾(D(ℓ(f)∗) ∩Fb(H )).
Note that the operator on the right-hand side is not closed. But one has
the following:
Boson Fock Spaces
261
Lemma 5.4. For all f ∈H , A†(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on
Fb(H ) and the adjoint
A(f) := A†(f)∗
(5.49)
takes the following form:
D(A(f)) =

Ψ ∈Fb(H )|
∞

n=0
∥
√
n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1)∥2 < ∞

,
(A(f)Ψ)(n) =
√
n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1)),
Ψ ∈D(A(f)).
In particular, A(f) is a densely deﬁned closed operator on Fb(H ).
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 4.4 to the following case: H =
Fb(H ), Hn = ⊗n
s H and A(n)
+
= √n + 1Sn+1cn,+(f)Sn (this is a bounded
operator from ⊗n
s H to ⊗n+1
s
H ).
□
It follows from the deﬁnition of A(f) and the closedness of A†(f) that
A(f)∗= A†(f),
f ∈H .
(5.50)
We call A(f) and A(f)∗the boson annihilation operator and the boson
creation operator with test vector f, respectively.
For a class of vectors Ψ ∈D(A(f)), A(f)Ψ is explicitly written as follows.
Lemma 5.5. For any Ψ ∈Fb(H ) of the form Ψ (m) = δm,nSn(⊗n
j=1fj)
with fj ∈H (n ≥1, m ≥0),
(A(f)Ψ)(m) = δm,n−1


j=1
⟨f, fj⟩Sn−1(f1 ⊗· · · ⊗ˆfj ⊗· · · ⊗fn),
(5.51)
where ˆfj indicates the omission of fj.
Proof. Since Ψ (m) = 0 for all m ̸= n, it follows that (A(f)Ψ)(m) = 0 for
all m ̸= n−1. Hence, we need only to prove (5.51) in the case of m = n−1.
We have
(A(f)Ψ)(n−1) = Sn−1(ℓ(f)Ψ)(n−1)
= Sn−1

obtains (5.51).
□
Lemma 5.6. For all f ∈H \ {0}, A(f) and A(f)∗are unbounded.
Proof. For each N ∈N, we deﬁne a vector ΨN ∈Fb(H ) by Ψ (N)
N
:= ⊗N
f/∥f∥N and Ψ (n)
N
= 0 for n ̸= N. Then, ΨN ∈D(A(f)) and ∥ΨN∥= 1.
Moreover (A(f)ΨN)(N−1) =
√
N ⊗N−1 f/∥f∥N−2 and (A(f)ΨN)(n) = 0,
n ̸= N −1. Hence, ∥A(f)ΨN∥=
√
N∥f∥→∞as N →∞. Thus, A(f) is
unbounded. Hence, by Proposition 1.10, A(f)∗is also unbounded.
□
Example 5.4. Let us consider the boson Fock space Fb(L2(X, dμ))
over L2(X, dμ) (Example 5.2) and see what forms A(f) and A(f)∗
(f ∈L2(X, dμ)) take under the natural isomorphism (5.5). For nota-

$
X
f(x)∗Φ(n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn)dμ(x).

With regard to the creation operator A(f)∗, by (5.48), one can show
that, for all Ψ ∈D(A(f)∗) and n ≥1,
(A(f)∗Ψ)(n)(x1, . . . , xn) =
√n
n!

σ∈Sn
f(xσ(1))Ψ (n−1)(xσ(2), . . . , xσ(n)).

is equal to
1
√n
n

j=1
f(xj)Ψ (n−1)(x1, . . . , ˆxj, . . . , xn).

j=1
f(xj)Ψ (n−1)(x1, . . . , ˆxj, . . . , xn).
(5.53)
It is obvious that D(A(f)) and D(A(f)∗include the ﬁnite particle
subspace Fb,0(H ) (see (5.1)):
Fb,0(H ) ⊂D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗),
f ∈H ,
In what follows, we denote by A(f)# either A(f) or A(f)∗.
264
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proposition 5.6. Let f ∈H .
(i) The operator A(f)# leaves Fb,0(H ) invariant: A(f)#Fb,0(H ) ⊂
Fb,0(H ).
(ii) The subspace Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f)#.
(iii) For any dense subspace D in H , Fﬁn,b(D) is a core for A(f)#.
Proof. (i) This follows from the deﬁnition of A(f)#.
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(A(f)) and, for each N ∈N, deﬁne a vector ΨN ∈
Fb,0(H ) by Ψ (n)
N
:= Ψ (n) for n ≤N and Ψ (n)
N
= 0 for n ≥N + 1. Then, it
is easy to see that ΨN →Ψ and
∥A(f)ΨN −A(f)Ψ∥2 =
∞

n=N+1
n∥Sn−1cn−1,+(f)∗Ψ (n)∥2 →0 (N →∞).
Hence, A(f)ΨN →A(f)Ψ (N →∞). Thus, Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f).
Similarly, one can show that Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f)∗.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ). Then, there exists an n0 ∈N such that
Ψ (n) = 0, for all n ≥n0 + 1. Let n ≤n0. Since Sn(⊗
nD) is dense in
⊗n
s H , there exists a sequence {Ψ (n)
k
}k in Sn(⊗
nD) such that Ψ (n)
k
→
Ψ (n) (k
→
∞). Recall that cn,+(f) is a bounded operator. Hence,
√n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1)
k
→√n + 1Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1) (k →∞). Therefore,
letting Ψk := {Ψ (0)
k , . . . , Ψ (n0)
k
, 0, 0, . . .} ∈Fb,ﬁn(D), we see that Ψk →Ψ
and A(f)Ψk →A(f)Ψ (k →∞). Hence, by an application of Proposition
1.16, Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for A(f). Similarly one can prove that Fb,ﬁn(D)
is a core for A(f)∗.
□
It follows from the deﬁnition of A(f) that, for all f ∈H , A(f)
eliminates the Fock vacuum ΩH :
A(f)ΩH = 0.
(5.54)
The Fock vacuum ΩH as an element of the boson Fock space Fb(H )
is called the boson Fock vacuum. This vector is, in fact, characterized
by Equation (5.54):
Proposition 5.7 (Uniqueness of Fock vacuum). Let D be a dense
subspace of H . Suppose that a vector Ψ ∈∩f∈DD(A(f)) obeys A(f)Ψ = 0,
for all f ∈D. Then, Ψ = α, ΩH with a constant α ∈C.
Boson Fock Spaces
265
Proof. Under the present assumption, Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1) = 0, for all n ≥0.
Hence, for all Φ ∈⊗n
s H ,
0 =
"
Sncn,+(f)∗Ψ (n+1), Φ
#
=
"
Ψ (n+1), Sn+1(f ⊗Φ)
#
= 0.
On the other hand, span {Sn+1(f ⊗Φ)|f ∈D, Φ ∈⊗n
s H } is dense in
⊗n+1
s
H . Hence, Ψ (n+1) = 0, n ≥0. Hence, Ψ
= {Ψ (0), 0, 0, . . .} =
alpha ΩH , with α := Ψ (0) ∈C.
□
Remark 5.5. For any ﬁnite set F := {f1, . . . , fm} consisting of linearly
independent vectors f1, . . . , fm in H (m < dim H ), there always exists a
non-zero vector Ψ ∈∩m
j=1D(A(fj)) which is not a scalar multiple of ΩH
and obeys A(fj)Ψ = 0, j = 1, . . . , m. For example, let g ∈F ⊥\{0} and, for
each n ∈N, deﬁne Ψg ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ) by Ψ (0)
g
:= α (α ∈C is arbitrary) and
Ψ (n)
g
:= ⊗ng (n ≥1), Ψ (k)
g
:= 0, k ̸= n. Then, A(fj)Ψg = 0, j = 1, . . . , m.
But Ψg is not a scalar multiple of ΩH .
In fact, one can prove the following fact (Problem 1):
{Ψ ∈∩m
j=1D(A(fj)) | A(fj)Ψ = 0, j = 1, . . . , m} = ⊕∞
n=0 ⊗n
s F ⊥.
(5.55)
The proof is based on the orthogonal decomposition H = (span F) ⊕F ⊥
and the natural isomorphism Fb(H ) ∼= Fb(span F)⊗Fb(F ⊥) (see Section
5.22), where A(fj) is unitarily equivalent to A(fj) ⊗I.
Using (5.48) repeatedly, one can see that, for all n ∈N, and fj ∈H (j =
1, . . . , n),
(A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH )(m) = δnm
√
n!f1 · · · fn,
m ≥1.
(5.56)
This shows that an elemental ﬁnite particle vector in Fb(H ) is of the form
A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
It follows from (5.56) that span {A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH | fj ∈H , j = 1,
. . . , n} is dense in the boson n-particle space. Formula (5.56) also implies
the following inequality:
∥A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ∥≤
√
n!∥f1∥· · · ∥fn∥.
(5.57)
It follows from (5.56) that, for each subspace D of H ,
Fb,ﬁn(D) =span

In particular, if D is dense in H , then
span {ΩH , A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH | n ∈N, fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , n}
is dense in Fb(H ). This shows a basic role of the creation operators.
The action of dΓb(T ) on elemental ﬁnite particle vectors in Fb(H ) is
given as follows.
Proposition 5.8. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H
and f1, . . . , fn ∈D(T ) (n ∈N). Then, Ψ := A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH is in

Formula (5.56) implies the following important inner product formula:

□
In relation to (5.58), we want to mention a basic concept in operator
theory.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let X be a Hilbert space and {Aα|α ∈S} be a set of lin-
ear operators on X (Aα ∈L(X ) and S is an index set). A non-zero vector
Ψ0 ∈X is called a cyclic vector of {Aα|α ∈S} if Ψ0 ∈∩∞
n=1∩αj∈S,j=1,...,n
D(Aα1 · · · Aαn) and span {Ψ0, Aα1 · · · AαnΨ0 | n ∈N, αj ∈S, j = 1, . . . , n}
is dense in X . In this case, {Aα|α ∈S} is said to have a cyclic
vector Ψ0.
Formula (5.58) with D dense in H is rephrased as follows.
Proposition 5.9. Suppose that D is a dense subspace of H . Then, the
Fock vacuum ΩH is a cyclic vector of {A(f)∗|f ∈D}.4
5.7.2
Commutation relations
Let us ﬁnd the commutation relations of A(f)#’s (f ∈H ). For each r ∈
Z+, we introduce
Fb,r(H ) := {Ψ ∈Fb(H ) | Ψ (n) = 0, for all n ≥r + 1}
This is a closed subspace of Fb(H ), which is naturally isomorphic to
⊕r
n=0 ⊗n
s H .
In the context of a Bose ﬁeld theory, Fb,r(H ) is a Hilbert space of
states for the subsystem consisting of at most r bosons.
Lemma 5.7. Let f ∈H and r ≥0. We set Fb,−1(H ) = {0}.
(i) A(f) is a bounded operator from Fb,r(H ) to Fb,r−1(H ) with
∥A(f) ↾Fb,r(H )∥≤√r∥f∥.
4In this case, the index set S is D.
268

(ii) A(f)∗is a bounded operator from Fb,r(H ) to Fb,r+1(H ) with
∥A(f)∗↾Fb,r(H )∥≤
√
r + 1∥f∥.
(iii) Let fn, f ∈H and limn→∞fn = f. Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ),
limn→∞A(fn)Ψ = A(f)Ψ and limn→∞A(fn)∗Ψ = A(f)∗Ψ.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fb,r(H ). Then, it is easy to see that A(f)Ψ ∈Fb,r−1(H )
and A(f)∗Fb,r+1(H ).
(i) Using the fact that ∥Sn∥= 1 and ∥cn,+(f)∗∥= ∥f∥, we have
∥A(f)Ψ∥2 =

∥Ψ (n−1)∥2 = (r + 1)∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence, the desired result follows.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ). Then, there exists an r ≥0 such that Ψ ∈Fb,r
(H ). By (i), ∥A(fn)Ψ −A(f)Ψ∥≤√r∥fn −f∥∥Ψ∥. Hence, limn→∞A(fn)
Ψ = A(f)Ψ. Similarly, using (ii), we can prove limn→∞A(fn)∗Ψ = A(f)∗Ψ.

Theorem 5.14. For all f, g ∈H ,

Proof. n ≥1 and fj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , n), we deﬁne a vector Ψn ∈Fb,0(H )
by
Ψ (m)

(A(g)∗Ψn)(m) =
√n + 1gf1 · · · fn ;
m = n + 1

m ̸= n + 1

(A(g)∗A(f)Ψn)(n) =

⟨f, fj⟩gf1 · · · ˆfj · · · fn.
Therefore,
([A(f), A(g)∗]Ψn)(n) = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ (n)
n .
If m ̸= n, then (A(f)A(g)∗Ψn)(m) = 0, (A(g)∗A(f)Ψn)(m) = 0. Thus,
[A(f), A(g)∗]Ψn = ⟨f, g⟩Ψn.
It is easy to see that
[A(f), A(g)∗]ΩH = ⟨f, g⟩ΩH .
Since any vector in Fb,ﬁn(H ) can be written as a ﬁnite linear combination
of ΩH and vectors of the form Ψn (n ≥1, f1, . . . , fn ∈H ), it follows that,
270
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ),
[A(f), A(g)∗]Ψ = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ.
(5.64)
We next consider the case where Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ). Then, there exists a
sequence {ΨN}∞
N=1 in Fb,ﬁn(H ) such that ΨN →Ψ (N →∞). By (5.64),
A(f)A(g)∗ΨN −A(g)∗A(f)ΨN = ⟨f, g⟩ΨN.
There exists a number r ∈N such that Ψ, ΨN ∈Fb,r(H ), for all N ≥1.
By Lemma 5.7,
A(f)A(g)∗ΨN →A(f)A(g)∗Ψ, A(g)∗A(f)ΨN →A(g)∗A(f)Ψ (N →∞).
Hence, for all Ψ
∈Fb,0(H ), (5.64) holds. Namely, (5.62) holds on
Fb,0(H ). Similarly, one can prove (5.63).
□
We call commutation relations (5.62) and (5.63) the Dirac canonical
commutation relations (CCR) over H . But, in what follows, we simply
call them the CCR over H .
Remark 5.6. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H and an := A(en) (n ∈N).
Then, (5.62) and (5.63) imply the following commutation relations: for all
n, m ∈N,
[an, a∗
m] = δnm,
[an, am] = 0,
[a∗
n, a∗
m] = 0
on Fb,0(H ).
With regard to the domain of A(f)#, we have in fact the following.
Corollary 5.6. For all f ∈H , D(A(f)) = D(A(f)∗) and, for all Ψ ∈
D(A(f)) (= D(A(f)∗),
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 = ∥A(f)Ψ∥2 + ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
(5.65)
Proof. Using (5.62) with g = f, we have
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 = ∥A(f)Ψ∥2 + ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ).
(5.66)
Let Ψ ∈D(A(f)). Then, by Proposition 5.6(ii)), there exists a sequence
{Ψn}n ⊂Fb,0(H ) such that Ψn →Ψ and A(f)Ψn →A(f)Ψ (n →∞).
Boson Fock Spaces
271
Replacing Ψ by Ψn −Ψm in (5.66), we see that {A(f)∗Ψn}n is a Cauchy
sequence. Since A(f)∗is closed, we conclude that Ψ ∈D(A(f)∗) and
A(f)∗Ψ = limn→∞A(f)∗Ψn. Hence, D(A(f)) ⊂D(A(f)∗) and (5.65) holds.
Similarly one can show that D(A(f)∗) ⊂D(A(f)).

Theorem 5.14 implies the following useful formula.

Proof. By (5.62), we have
A(f)A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= ([A(f), A(f1)∗] + A(f1)∗A(f))A(f2)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= ⟨f, f1⟩A(f2)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH + A(f1)∗A(f)A(f2)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Iterating this equation and using (5.54), we obtain (5.67).

(i) For all f ∈D, A(f)∗Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).
(ii) For all f ∈H , A(f)Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).

Fb,ﬁn(D).
(ii) This follows from (5.67).

5.7.3
Irreducibility
In this section, we prove another important property of the operator set
{A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈H }. For this purpose, we ﬁrst introduce a concept on a
set of linear operators on a Hilbert space.
Let X be a Hilbert space and L be a set of (not necessarily bounded)
linear operators on X : L ⊂L(X ).
272
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Deﬁnition 5.2.
(i) Let M be a closed subspace of X . Then, M is said to reduce L if
each A ∈L is reduced by M . In this case, M is called a reducing
subspace of L.
Remark. Obviously, {0} and X reduce L. These spaces are called the
trivial reducing subspaces.
(ii) The set L is said to be reducible if it has a non-trivial reducing
subspace (i.e., there exists a closed subspace M ̸= {0}, X reducing L).
(iii) The set L is said to be irreducible if it is not reducible (i.e., L has
no non-trivial reducing subspaces).
Remark 5.7. In the case where L ⊂B(X ), it is easy to see that a closed
subspace M is a reducing subspace of L if and only if L leaves M and M ⊥
invariant (i.e., for all A ∈L, AM ⊂M and AM ⊥⊂M ⊥).
We ﬁrst want to show that reducibility and irreducibility are unitarily
invariant concepts.
Let X and Y be Hilbert spaces and L ⊂L(X ) and B ⊂L(Y ). The
operator set L is said to be unitarily equivalent to B if there exists a
unitary operator U : X →Y such that B = {UAU −1|A ∈L}.
It follows that L is unitarily equivalent to B if and only if B is unitarily
equivalent to L (so the above deﬁnition is well-deﬁned).
Proposition 5.10. Let L ⊂L(X ) and B ⊂L(Y ) and suppose that L is
unitarily equivalent to B. Then, L is reducible (resp., irreducible) if and
only if B is reducible (resp., irreducible).
Proof. Under the present assumption, there exists a unitary operator U :
X →Y such that B = {UAU −1|A ∈L}. Suppose that L is reducible.
Then, there exists a closed subspace M ⊂X such that M ̸= {0}, X and
each A ∈L is reduced by M . Let N := UM . Then, N is a closed subspace
of Y and N ̸= {0}, Y . Each B ∈B is written B = UAU −1, with some
A ∈L. By Proposition 1.54, B is reduced by N . Thus, B is reducible.
Conversely, if B is reducible, then, by symmetry (one needs only to
replace (X , U, A) by (Y , U −1, B) in the above argument), one can conclude
that L is reducible.
□
Boson Fock Spaces
273
To characterize the irreducibility of L, we introduce a subset of B(X ) by
L′ := {T ∈B(X ) | T A ⊂AT, A ∈L},
(5.68)
which is called the commutant of L. It is easy to see that L′ is a subspace
of B(X ).
Lemma 5.8. Let L, M ⊂L(X ) and L ⊂M. Then, M′ ⊂L′.
Proof. An easy exercise.
□
The set L is said to be ∗-invariant if each element A in L is densely
deﬁned closed and A∗∈L. In this case, A∗is densely deﬁned and A∗∗= A.
We denote by CI the set of scalar operators on X :
CI := {cI | c ∈C}.
Proposition 5.11. Let L ⊂L(X ).
(i) If L′ = CI, then L is irreducible.
(ii) Let L be ∗-invariant and irreducible. Then, L′ = CI.
Proof. (i) Let M be a reducing subspace of L and P be the orthogonal
projection onto M . Then, for each A ∈L, PA ⊂AP. Hence, P ∈L′. Hence,
under the present assumption, P = cI for some c ∈C. Since P = P ∗and
P 2 = P, it follows that c = 0, 1, i.e., P = 0 or I. This means that M = {0}
or X . Thus, L is irreducible.
(ii) Let T ∈L′. Then, for all A ∈L, T A ⊂AT . Hence, (AT )∗⊂(T A)∗.
We have (AT )∗⊃T ∗A∗and (T A)∗= A∗T ∗(by the boundedness of T ).
Hence, T ∗A∗⊂A∗T ∗. By the ∗-invariance of L, A∗∈L. Hence, taking
A∗instead of A and using the fact that (A∗)∗= A, we obtain T ∗A ⊂
AT ∗. Hence, T ∗∈L′. Therefore, the bounded self-adjoint operators S+ :=
(T +T ∗)/2 and S−:= (T −T ∗)/2i are in L′. Let E(·) be the spectral measure
of S+. Then, using Stone’s formula, E(B)A ⊂AE(B) for all Borel sets B ⊂
R and A ∈L. This means that RanE(B) reduces L. By the irreducibility of
L, RanE(B) = {0} or X . Let a = inf supp E. Then, a ∈σ(S+). Hence, for
all ε > 0, E([a, a + ε]) ̸= 0. Therefore, RanE([a, a + ε]) = X . Considering
the limit ε ↓0, we obtain RanE({a}) = X . Hence, E({a}) = I, which
implies that S+ = aI. Similarly, one can show that S−= bI, for some
b ∈R. Therefore, T = S+ + iS−= cI (c = a + ib). Thus, L′ = CI.
□
Now, we are ready to prove a basic fact about the set of the boson
creation and annihilation operators:
274
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 5.15. Let D be a dense subspace of H . Then,
{A(f), A(f)∗| f ∈D}′ = CI.
(5.69)
In particular, it is irreducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{A(f), A(f)∗| f ∈D}′. Then, for all f ∈D, T A(f)# ⊂
A(f)#T . By this relation with A(f)#
= A(f) and (5.54), we have
A(f)T ΩH = 0, f ∈D. Hence, by Proposition 5.7, there exists a number
c ∈C such that T ΩH = cΩH . The relation T A(f)∗⊂A(f)∗T (f ∈D)
implies that, for all n ∈N and f1, . . . , fn ∈D,
T A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗T ΩH
= cA(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D), T Ψ = cΨ. Since T is bounded with D(T ) =
Fb(H ) and Fb,ﬁn(D) is dense in Fb(H ), it follows that T = cI. Thus,
(5.69) holds.
□
5.7.4
Reduction of creation and annihilation operators
Let M be a closed subspace of H and PM be the orthogonal projection
onto M .
Theorem 5.16. Let f ∈M . Then, A(f)# is reduced by Fb(M ).
Proof. By Theorem 5.7(v), Q := Γb(PM ) is the orthogonal projection onto
Fb(M ). Let Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ). Then, A(f)∗QΨ = QA(f)∗Ψ. Since Fb,ﬁn(H )
is a core for A(f)∗, it follows from a limiting argument that QA(f)∗⊂
A(f)∗Q. Hence, Fb(M ) reduces A(f)∗. Therefore, Fb(M ) reduces A(f)
too.
□

Occupation Number Representations for a System
of Finitely Many Bosons
In Section 2.10.1, we introduced occupation number representations in
a system of a ﬁnite number of bosons. In this section, we extend the
occupation number representations to a system of ﬁnitely many bosons.
Let H
be a Hilbert space denoting a one-boson Hilbert space and
Fb(H ) be the boson Fock space over H . Let Ψ (N)
b
(n1, n2, . . .) be deﬁned
by (2.61). Using the natural identiﬁcation on the components in an inﬁnite
Boson Fock Spaces
275
direct sum Hilbert space (see Section 4.1), the vector Ψ (N)
b
(n1, n2, . . .) is
identiﬁed with a vector in F (N)
b
(H ). By Proposition 4.2, we have the
following.
Proposition 5.12. The set
Eb :=

(5.70)
is a CONS of Fb(H ).
It follows from this proposition that each Ψ ∈Fb(H ) is expanded as
Ψ = Ψ (0)ΩH +

(5.71)
This expansion is called the occupation number representation of Ψ ∈
Fb(H ) with respect to the CONS {ej}∞
j=1 ⊂H .
It follows from the Parseval equality that
∥Ψ∥2 = |Ψ (0)|2 +

(5.72)
Proposition 5.13 shows that no inﬁnite particle states such that 
j nj =
∞exists within the boson Fock space Fb(H ). To describe such states,
one needs the theory of inﬁnite tensor product of Hilbert spaces. (see
Section 2.13). In this book, we are content with the occupation number rep-
resentation (5.71), which describes the occupations of ﬁnitely many number
of bosons.
5In general, for any ONS {en}∞
n=1 of a Hilbert space X , w- limn→∞en = 0, i.e.,
limn→∞⟨ψ, en⟩= 0, ∀ψ ∈X . This follows from the Bessel inequality ∞

Relations among the Creation and Annihilation
Operators and the Second Quantization Operators
So far, we have treated the second quantization operators and the creation
and annihilation operators separately. But they should have some non-
trivial relations because the creation and annihilation operators are non-
diagonal ones. This section is devoted to studies on this aspect.
5.9.1
Relative boundedness of the creation and annihilation
operators with respect to second quantization
operators
The following theorem, which is the main result in this section, plays a
basic role in the analysis on boson Fock spaces.
Theorem 5.17. Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H . Then, for all f ∈D(T −1/2),
D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗)
and, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2),
∥A(f)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥,
(5.74)
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 ≤∥T −1/2f∥2 ∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
(5.75)
Remark 5.8. (i) By Theorem 5.2, for any non-negative self-adjoint
operator T , dΓb(T ) is a non-negative self-adjoint operator. Hence, using
functional calculus, the square root dΓb(T )1/2 is deﬁned.
(ii) By Corollary 5.6, D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗) = D(A(f)) = D(A(f)∗), for
all f ∈H .
To prove Theorem 5.17, we need some preliminaries.
For each f ∈H and n ≥0, j = 1, . . . , n+1, there exists a unique linear
operator K(n)
j
(f) from ⊗nH to ⊗n+1H satisfying
D(K(n)

Since Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓ(T ) by Theorem 5.1(iv), it is a
core for dΓb(T )1/2 (apply Proposition 1.43). Hence, by Proposition 1.19,
D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(A(f)) and (5.74) holds. Inequality (5.75) follows from
(5.74) and Corollary 5.6.

Remark 5.9. In the case where H

a dense subspace of X .

Theorem 3.12. Hence, by Theorems 5.7(ii) and 5.9 and Examples 5.3

Then, by Example 5.4, one uses (5.52) to estimate A(f)Φ (Φ ∈D(A(f)).

Hence, ∥A(f)Φ(n)∥2 ≤∥F −1/2f∥2∥∥(.

∥A(f)Φ∥2 ≤∥F −1/2f∥2∥.
dΓb(T )1/2Φ∥2.
This is equivalent to (5.74). The proof given here shows the usefulness of
Theorem 3.12 and of moving to a suitable unitarily equivalent realization
of the abstract boson Fock space.
Taking T = I in Theorem 5.17, we obtain an estimate showing the

(5.84)
Proof. Estimate (5.82) is a direct consequence of (5.74). For (5.83), we
need only to apply formula (1.73) to S = Nb. We have for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b

∥ΦS(f)Ψ∥≤

Theorem 5.17 also implies the inﬁnitesimal smallness of A(f)# (f ∈

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We estimate the right-hand side of (5.74) and (5.75). Let Ψ ∈
D(dΓb(T )). Then, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥=

⟨Ψ, dΓb(T )Ψ⟩≤∥Ψ∥1/2∥dΓb(T )Ψ∥1/2.
Hence, using the elementary inequality
ab ≤εa2 + 1
4εb2
(a > 0, b > 0, ε > 0),
(5.87)
we obtain
∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥≤ε∥dΓb(T )Ψ∥+ 1
4ε∥T −1/2f∥2∥Ψ∥.
This estimate and (5.74) yield (5.85).
Inequality (5.75) implies that
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥Ψ∥.
Hence, we obtain (5.86).

Commutation relations among dΓb(T ) and A(f)#
We next consider the commutation properties of the boson second quanti-
zation operators with the creation and annihilation operators.
Proposition 5.14. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
(i) For all f ∈D(T ),
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([dΓb(T ), A(f)∗])
and
[dΓb(T ), A(f)∗] = A(T f)∗
on Fb,ﬁn(D(T )).
(ii) For all f ∈D(T ∗),
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([dΓb(T ), A(f)])
and
[dΓb(T ), A(f)] = −A(T ∗f)
on Fb,ﬁn(D(T )).
Boson Fock Spaces
283
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). Then, by (5.58), each Ψ (n) with n ≥1
is a linear combination of vectors of the form A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , with
fj ∈D(T ), j = 1, . . . , n. Hence, by Proposition 5.8, Ψ, A(f)∗Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T ))
(f ∈D(T )) and
dΓb(T )A(f)∗Ψ = A(T f)∗Ψ + A(f)∗dΓb(T )Ψ.
Hence, (5.14) holds.
(ii) Let f ∈D(T ∗) and Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). Then, by (5.67), we see, as in
(i), that Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T ), A(f)]) and [dΓb(T ), A(f)]Ψ = −A(T ∗f)Ψ. Thus,
the desired result follows.
□
In the case where T
is self-adjoint, non-negative and injective,
Proposition 5.14 can be reﬁned further as follows.
Theorem 5.18. Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H .
(i) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D(dΓb(T )) and f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2),
⟨dΓb(T )Ψ, A(f)Φ⟩−⟨A(f)∗Ψ, dΓb(T )Φ⟩= −⟨Ψ, A(T f)Φ⟩.
(5.88)
(ii) For each f
∈
D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2), A(f)# maps D(dΓb(T )3/2) to
D(dΓb(T )) and satisﬁes commutation relations
[dΓb(T ), A(f)∗] = A(T f)∗,
[dΓb(T ), A(f)] = −A(T f)
on D(dΓb(T )3/2).
Proof. (i) By Proposition 5.14, for all Ψ
∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) and Φ ∈
D(dΓb(T )), (5.88) holds. Since Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓb(T ), for any
Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )), there exists a sequence {Ψn}n ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) such that
Ψn →Ψ and dΓb(T )Ψn →dΓb(T )Ψ (n →∞). Hence,
⟨dΓb(T )Ψn, A(f)Φ⟩−⟨A(f)∗Ψn, dΓb(T )Φ⟩= −⟨Ψn, A(T f)Φ⟩.
By (5.86), A(f)∗Ψn →A(f)∗Ψ (n →∞). Hence, taking the limit n →∞
in the above equation, we obtain (5.88)
284
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )3/2) and Φ ∈D(dΓb(T )). Then, dΓb(T )Ψ ∈
D(dΓb(T )1/2). Hence, by (i),
⟨(A(f)∗dΓb(T ) + A(T f)∗) Ψ, Φ⟩= ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, dΓb(T )Φ⟩.
This means that A(f)∗Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )) and
dΓb(T )A(f)∗Ψ = (A(f)∗dΓb(T ) + A(T f)∗) Ψ.
Hence, the statement on A(f)∗is proved. Similarly, one can prove the state-
ment on A(f).

5.9.3
Relative boundedness of A(f)#A(g)# with respect
to dΓb(T )
Let T be a nonnegative and injective self-adjoint operator on H . As an
application of Theorem 5.18, we show that, for all f, g in a subspace of H ,
A(f)#A(g)# is relatively bounded with respect to dΓb(T ). For notational
simplicity, we set
H := dΓb(T )
throughout this section. Since H is nonnegative and self-adjoint, H + 1 is
bijective, with (H + 1)−1 being bounded and ∥(H + 1)−1∥= 1. We remark
that, for each f ∈H ,
D((H + 1)−1A(f)#H1/2) = D(A(f)#H1/2)
=

Ψ ∈D(H1/2)|H1/2Ψ ∈D(A(f)#
by the deﬁnition of the product of operators.
Lemma 5.11. Let f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ). Then, (H + 1)−1A(f)#H1/2 is
bounded with
∥(H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2∥≤cT (f),
(5.89)
∥(H + 1)−1A(f)∗H1/2∥≤dT (f),
(5.90)
where
cT (f) := ∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥T 1/2f∥,
dT (f) := cT (f) + 1
2(∥f∥+ ∥T f∥).
Boson Fock Spaces
285
Proof. By Theorem 5.18(ii), we have
(H + 1)A(f) −A(f)(H + 1) = −A(T f)
on D(H3/2). Since D(H) ⊂D(H3/2) and A(f) is H1/2-bounded (Theorem
5.17), it follows that
A(f)(H + 1)−1H1/2 −(H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2
= −(H + 1)−1A(T f)(H + 1)−1H1/2
on D(H). Hence, for all Ψ ∈D(H),
∥(H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2Ψ∥
≤∥A(f)(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥+ ∥(H + 1)−1A(T f)(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥
+ ∥(H + 1)−1∥∥T −1/2T f∥∥H1/2(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥
= cT (f)∥H1/2(H + 1)−1H1/2Ψ∥.
By functional calculus, H1/2(H + 1)−1H1/2 is bounded with ∥H1/2(H +
1)−1H1/2∥≤1. Hence, (H + 1)−1A(f)H1/2 is bounded and (5.89) holds.
Similarly, using (5.75) and ∥(H + 1)−1H1/2∥= 1/2, one can show that
(H + 1)−1A(f)∗H1/2 is bounded and (5.90) holds.
□
Lemma 5.12. Let f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ). Then, for all Ψ ∈D(H), Ψ ∈
D(H1/2A(f)#) and
∥H1/2A(f)Ψ∥≤dT (f)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥,
(5.91)
∥H1/2A(f)∗Ψ∥≤cT (f)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥.
(5.92)
Proof. By Lemma 5.11, K# := (H + 1)−1A(f)#H1/2 is a densely deﬁned
bounded linear operator on H . Hence, (K#)∗∈B(H ) and ∥(K#)∗∥=
∥K#∥. On the other hand, one has (K#)∗⊃H1/2(A(f)#)∗(H + 1)−1.
Hence, H1/2(A(f)#)∗(H + 1)−1 is bounded with ∥H1/2(A(f)#)∗(H +
1)−1∥= ∥(K#)∗∥= ∥K#∥. Therefore,
∥H1/2A(f)(H + 1)−1∥= ∥K∗∥≤dT (f),
∥H1/2A(f)∗(H + 1)−1∥= ∥K∥≤cT (f),
which imply (5.91) and (5.92), respectively.

(5.96)
Proof. By Lemma 5.12 and the fact that D(H1/2) ⊂D(A(h)#) (h ∈
D(T −1/2)), D(H) ⊂D(A(f)#A(g)#) and, for all Ψ ∈D(H),
∥A(f)A(g)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2A(g)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2∥dT (g)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥.
Hence, (5.93) holds. As for (5.94), we proceed as follows:
∥A(f)∗A(g)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2A(g)Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥A(g)Ψ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥dT (g)∥(H + 1)Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥T −1/2g∥∥H1/2Ψ∥.
We note that
∥H1/2Ψ∥= ∥H1/2(H + 1)−1(H + 1)Ψ∥
≤∥H1/2(H + 1)−1∥∥(H + 1)Ψ∥
= 1
2∥(H + 1)Ψ∥.
Thus, (5.94) holds. In the same way, (5.95) and (5.96) can be proved.

Thus, we see that A(f)#A(g)# with f, g
∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ) is
H-bounded.

Continuity of boson second quantization operators in
one-particle operators
In applications, there are cases where the continuity of dΓb(T ) in T in a
suitable sense is needed to consider. In this section, we prove the basic facts
about this aspect.

Proposition 5.15. Let Tn (n ∈N) and T be densely deﬁned closable
operators on H such that there exists a subspace D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(T ) ∩D(Tn)
and limn→∞Tnf = T f, f ∈D. Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D),
lim
n→∞dΓb(Tn)Ψ = dΓb(T )Ψ.
(5.97)
Proof. It is suﬃcient to show (5.97), for all vectors Ψ of the form Ψ =
A(f1)∗· · · A(fp)∗ΩH (fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , p, p ∈N). We have
dΓb(Tn)Ψ −dΓb(T )Ψ =
p

j=1
A(f1)∗· · · A(Tnfj −T fj)∗· · · A(fp)∗ΩH .
Hence, by (5.57),
∥dΓb(Tn)Ψ −dΓb(T )Ψ∥≤

Cj∥Tnfj −T fj∥,
with Cj := ∥f1∥· · · 0
∥fj∥· · · ∥fp∥( 0
∥fj∥indicates the omission of ∥fj∥). The
right-hand side converges to 0 as n →∞. Thus, (5.97) holds.
□
Theorem 5.20. Let Tn (n ∈N) and T be self-adjoint operators on H .
Suppose that there exists a core D for T such that D ⊂∩∞
n=1D(Tn) and
limn→∞Tnf = T f, f ∈D. Then:
(i) (strong resolvent convergence) For all z ∈C \ R,
s- lim
n→∞(dΓb(Tn) −z)−1 = (dΓb(T ) −z)−1.
(ii) (strong unitary group convergence) For all t ∈R,
s- lim
n→∞e−itdΓb(Tn) = e−itdΓb(T ).
(iii) (strong semi-group convergence) Suppose that Tn and T are nonnega-
tive. Then, for all β > 0,
s- lim
n→∞e−βdΓb(Tn) = e−βdΓb(T ).
Proof. (i) Since D is a core for T , Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓb(T ). Hence,
by Proposition 5.15, we can apply Theorem 1.50 to conclude that dΓb(Tn)
converges to dΓb(T ) in the strong resolvent sense as n →∞.
Parts (ii) and (iii) follow from (i) and Corollary 1.9(i) and (ii).

Representation of boson second quantizations
in terms of creation and annihilation operators
There are some kinds of continuity of the mapping: H ∋f →A(f)# ∈
L(Fb(H )) (f ∈H ).
Lemma 5.13.
(i) Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on H . Let
fn, f ∈D(T −1/2) and limn→∞T −1/2fn = T −1/2f. Then, for all Ψ ∈
D(dΓb(T )1/2), limn→∞A(fn)Ψ = A(f)Ψ.
(ii) Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on H . Let
fn, f ∈D(T −1/2), limn→∞fn = f and limn→∞T −1/2fn = T −1/2f.
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2), limn→∞A(fn)∗Ψ = A(f)∗Ψ.
(iii) Let fn, f
∈H , limn→∞fn = f. Then, for all Ψ
∈D(N 1/2
b
),
limn→∞A(fn)#Ψ = A(f)#Ψ.
(iv) Let T be a densely deﬁned operator and fn, f ∈D(T ), limn→∞fn = f.
Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗)), limn→∞A(T fn)Ψ = A(T f)Ψ.
Proof. (i) By (5.74),
∥A(fn)Ψ −A(f)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2(fn −f)∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥→0(n →∞).
(ii) The proof of this part is similar to (i) (use (5.75)).
(iii) We need only to apply the facts in (i) and (ii) to the case T = I.
(iv) Let Ψ = A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH
∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ∗)) (m ≥0, gj ∈
D(T ∗)). Then, using CCR and (5.54), we have
A(T fn)Ψ =
m

j=1
⟨fn, T ∗gj⟩A(g1)∗· · ·

Hence,

⟨f, T ∗gj⟩A(g1)∗· · ·


A(gj)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH
= A(T f)Ψ.
Thus, the desired result follows.
□
Remark 5.10. Under the condition in part (iv) of Lemma 5.13, A(T fn)∗Ψ
does not necessarily converge to A(T f)∗Ψ as n →∞. For example, it is
Boson Fock Spaces
289
easy to see that, if T fn does not converge to T f, then A(T fn)∗ΩH does
not converge to A(T f)∗ΩH as n →∞. In this sense, the regularity of the
operator-valued functional A(·)∗is lower than that of A(·).
The following theorem gives formulae for the second quantization
operators in terms of the creation and annihilation operators.
Theorem 5.21. Let K be a separable Hilbert space and Let T be a densely
deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
(i) Let S ∈B(K , H ) and ST be closable.7 Let {en|n ∈N} ⊂D(T ∗) be
a CONS of K . Then, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(ST )),
dΓb(ST )Ψ =

In particular, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ),

(5.99)
(ii) Let S be a densely deﬁned linear operator from K to H such that
ST is a densely deﬁned closable operator and {en|n ∈N} ⊂D(S) ∩
D(T ∗) be a CONS of K . Then, for all Φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗)) and Ψ ∈
Fb,ﬁn(D(ST )),
⟨Φ, dΓb(ST )Ψ⟩= lim

∥dΓb(T ∗T )1/2Ψ∥2 =
∞

n=1
∥A(T ∗en)Ψ∥2.
(5.101)
Proof. (i) It is suﬃcient to prove (5.98) for vectors Ψ of the form
Ψ = A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH , gj ∈D(T ), m ≥1. Let LN := N

LNΨ =

where PN is a linear operator from H to K , given by
D(PN) := H ,
PNf :=

n=1
⟨T ∗en, f⟩en, f ∈H .
Since {en}n is a CONS of K , it follows that, for all f ∈D(T ), PNf →T f
(N →∞). Hence, by the boundedness of S, SPNf →ST f (N →∞).
Therefore, by Lemma 5.13(iii),
lim
N→∞LNΨ =
m

j=1
A(g1)∗· · · A(ST gj)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH = dΓb(ST )Ψ.
Thus, (5.98) is obtained.
Formula (5.99) is simply the case of (5.98) with K = H and S = T = I.
(ii) Let Φ := A(h1)∗· · · A(hm)∗ΩH (hj ∈D(S∗), j = 1, · · · , m). Then,

On the other hand,
 
hj, SPNgσ(j)

N→∞
 
hj, SPNgσ(j)

=
 
S∗hj, T gσ(j)

=
 
hj, ST gσ(j)

.
Therefore, ⟨Φ, LNΨ⟩→⟨Φ, dΓb(ST )Ψ⟩(N →∞). Thus, (5.100) follows.
(iii) By taking S = T ∗and Φ = Ψ in (5.100) and using the fact that
⟨Ψ, dΓb(T ∗T )Ψ⟩= ∥dΓb(T ∗T )1/2Ψ∥2, we obtain (5.101).

Inﬁnite series representation for the square root
of a second quantization operator
In the case where H is separable and T is self-adjoint, one can use the mul-
tiplication operator form of the spectral theorem (Theorem 3.12) to obtain
more detailed results. Let (X, Σ, μ), U and F be as in Theorem 3.12. Then,
we have the natural isomorphism (see Theorem 5.7(ii) and Example 5.2):
Fb(H )

We are now ready to prove the following theorem.
Theorem 5.22. Assume that H be separable. Let T be a non-negative

Hence, we prove this formula.
We ﬁrst remark that the non-negativity of T implies that of F: F ≥0.

The Segal Field Operator
Operators made from the boson creation and annihilation operators are the
main objects of analysis on the boson Fock space. Among those operators,
a simple and natural one may be A(f) + A(f)∗with f ∈H . It is obvious
that Fb,0(H ) ⊂D(A(f) + A(f)∗) and A(f) + A(f)∗is symmetric. Hence,
one can deﬁne a closed symmetric operator
ΦS(f) :=
1
√
2
(A(f) + A(f)∗),
f ∈H ,
(5.107)
where the constant 1/
√
2 is just for convenience. The operator ΦS(f) is
called the Segal ﬁeld operator with test vector f, which plays a funda-
mental role in applications to Bose ﬁeld theory. The purpose of this section
is to investigate the properties of the Segal ﬁeld operator.

there exists a constant cT (f, g) ≥0 such that
∥ΦS(f)ΦS(g)Ψ∥≤cT (f, g)∥(dΓb(T ) + 1)Ψ∥.
(5.111)
(iv) Let f, g ∈H . If ΦS(f)ΩH = ΦS(g)ΩH , then f = g.
Proof. (i) Let f
∈
D(T −1/2). Then, Theorem 5.17 implies that
D(dΓb(T )1/2) ⊂D(ΦS(f)) and (5.108) holds. Hence,
∥ΦS(f)Ψ∥≤
1
√
2
(∥A(f)Ψ∥+ ∥A(f)∗Ψ∥).
Then, using (5.74) and (5.75), we obtain (5.109).
(ii) This follows from (i) in the case T = I.
(iii) We have
ΦS(f)ΦS(g) = 1
2(A(f)A(g) + A(f)A(g)∗+ A(f)∗A(g) + A(f)∗A(g)∗)
on D(A(f)A(g)) ∩D(A(f)A(g)∗) ∩D(A(f)∗A(g)) ∩D(A(f)∗A(g)∗). Then,
applying Theorem 5.19 to each term on the right-hand side, we see that
ΦS(f)ΦS(g) is dΓb(T )-bounded (the constant cT (f, g) in (5.111) can be
explicitly written down, but we do not need it in this book).
(iv) The present assumption and (5.54) imply that A(f)∗ΩH = A(g)∗
ΩH . Since (A(h)∗ΩH )(1) = h for all h ∈H , it follows that f = g.

Then,

ΦS(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈Db):
ΦS(af + bg)Ψ = (aΦS(f) + bΦS(g)) Ψ, a, b ∈R, f, g ∈H , Ψ ∈Db.
Remark 5.11. For any non-real α, if f ̸= 0 (f ∈H ), then ΦS(αf) ̸=
αΦS(f) (Problem 7). Namely, the correspondence f →ΦS(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈Db) is
not complex linear. This is because the correspondence f →A(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈
Db) is anti-linear : A(αf)Ψ = α∗A(f)Ψ, α ∈C.
Proposition 5.17. For all f ∈H \ {0}, ΦS(f) is neither bounded from
below nor bounded from above.
Proof. For each N ∈N, we deﬁne ΨN(f) ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ) by Ψ (n)
N (f) =
(
√
2∥f∥n)−1 ⊗n f for n = N, N + 1 and Ψ (n)
N (f) = 0 for n ̸= N, N + 1.
Then, ∥ΨN(f)∥= 1 and

Hence, ⟨ΨN, A(f)ΨN⟩= ⟨ΨN, A(f)∗ΨN⟩∗=

⟨ΨN(f), ΦS(f)ΨN(f)⟩=

→∞(N →∞).
Hence, ΦS(f) is not bounded from above. Since ΦS(−f) = −ΦS(f), it follows
that ∥ΨN(−f)∥= 1 and
⟨ΨN(−f), ΦS(f)ΨN(−f)⟩= −

N + 1

∥f∥→−∞(N →∞).
Hence, ΦS(f) is not bounded from below.

2n terms
1
2n/2 A(f1)# · · · A(fn)#ΩH ,
Using (5.62), (5.63) and (5.54), we see that the vector on the right-hand
side is in Fb,ﬁn(D). Hence, PΦS(D) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(D).
Conversely, let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ∈Fb,ﬁn(D) (fj ∈D, j =
1, . . . , n). Then, using (5.114), we see that the vector on the right-hand side
is in PΦS(D). Hence, Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂PΦS(D). Thus, Fb,ﬁn(D) = PΦS(D).
(iii) This follows from Lemma 5.13(i) and (ii).

5.10.2
Self-adjointness of the Segal ﬁeld operator
Now, we prove a non-trivial important fact.
Theorem 5.23. Let f ∈H . Then, ΦS(f) is self-adjoint. Moreover, for
any dense subspace D of H , Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for ΦS(f).
Proof. For instructive reasons, we give two diﬀerent proofs.
(I) First proof. Since ΦS(f) is a closed symmetric operator, it is suﬃcient to
show that ΦS(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(D). Let f ̸= 0. Then,
one can write ΦS(f) = (∥f∥/
√
2)ΦS(F), with F :=
√
2f/∥f∥. We have
∥F∥=
√
2. Hence, it is enough to show that ΦS(f), with ∥f∥=
√
2 being
essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(D).
We ﬁrst prove the essential self-adjointness of ΦS(f) on Fb,ﬁn(D), for
f ∈D with ∥f∥=
√
2. By Proposition 1.30, we need only to prove that the
range of B± := (ΦS(f) ± i) ↾Fb,ﬁn(D) is dense in Fb(H ).
Let f0 := if/
√
2. Then, f0 ∈D and ∥f0∥= 1. Also, one can write
B± = i(−A(f0)∗+ A(f0) ± 1) on Fb,ﬁn(D). Let Ψ ∈Ran(B+)⊥. Then,
⟨Ψ, B+Φ⟩= 0, for all Φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D) · · · (∗).
Let H0 := span {f0}. For each h ∈D, we have the orthogonal
decomposition
h = α(h)f0 + h⊥,
with α(h) := ⟨f0, h⟩and h⊥:= h −α(h)f0 ∈H ⊥
0 . Since h and f0 are
in D, h⊥∈D ∩H ⊥
0 . Using this decomposition, we have for all hj ∈D

conditions {i1, . . . , ik}∩{j1, . . . , jN−k} = ∅and {i1, . . . , ik, j1, . . . , jN−k} =
{1, . . . , N}. Therefore, Fb,ﬁn(D) is algebraically spanned by vectors of the
form
Ψn,m := (A(f0)∗)nA(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH (n, m ≥0).
with gj ∈D ∩H ⊥
0
(j = 1, . . . , m). By (5.60), we have
∥Ψn,m∥=
√
n!Cm,
Cm := ∥A(g1)∗· · · A(gm)∗ΩH ∥.
Fixing m and g = (g1, . . . , gm) arbitrarily with Cm ̸= 0, we deﬁne a unit
vector
Φn :=
Ψn,m
∥Ψn,m∥∈Fb,ﬁn(D).
Then, by (5.60) again, we see that {Φn}∞
n=0 is an ONS in Fb(H ). Taking
Φ = Φn in (∗) and letting an := ⟨Ψ, Φn⟩, we have the recursion relation
√
n + 1an+1 = √n an−1 + an,
n ≥0,
with a−1 := 0. Hence, in particular, a0 = a1.
Suppose that a0 ̸= 0. Then, letting bn := an/a0, we have b0 = b1 = 1
and
√
n + 1bn+1 = √n bn−1 + bn.
By induction in n, we can show that bn ≥1, for all n ≥1. Hence,
∞
n=1 |bn|2 = ∞. Since {Φn}n is an ONS in Fb(H ), as remarked above,
the Bessel inequality implies that ∞
n=1 |bn|2 ≤∥Ψ∥2/a2
0. But this is a
contradiction. Hence, a0 = 0. Therefore, a1 = 0. By the recursion relation
on {an}n, we obtain an = 0, for all n ≥0. Namely, ⟨Ψ, Φn⟩= 0, for all
Boson Fock Spaces
299
n ≥0. Since m is arbitrary, it follows that ⟨Ψ, η⟩= 0, for all η ∈Fb,ﬁn(D).
Hence, Ψ = 0. Therefore, Ran(B+) is dense in Fb(H ).
Let Ψ ∈Ran(B−)⊥next. Then, we have
√
n + 1an+1 = √n an−1 −an,
n ≥0.
Hence, letting cn := (−1)nan, we obtain
√
n + 1cn+1 = √n cn−1 + cn.
Hence, using the preceding result, cn = 0, and hence an = 0. Therefore,
Ran(B−) is dense in Fb(H ). Thus, for f ∈D, ΦS(f) is essentially self-
adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(D).
Finally, we consider the case where f is a general element of H . Apply-
ing the preceding result to the case D = H , we see that ΦS(f) is essentially
self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(H ) and ΦS(f) is self-adjoint with
ΦS(f) = ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(H ).
(5.118)
Since D is dense in H , for each Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ), there exists a sequence
{ΨN}∞
N=1 in Fb,ﬁn(D) such that ΨN →Ψ (N →∞). By Lemma 5.7(i) and
(ii), ΦS(f)ΨN →ΦS(f)Ψ (N →∞). This means that ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(H ) ⊂
ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(D). By this relation and (5.118), we obtain
ΦS(f) = ΦS(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(D).
Thus, Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for ΦS(f).
(II) Second proof. One can apply Theorem 1.35. We ﬁrst show that, for all
f ∈H , Fb,0(H ) is a set of entire analytic vectors of ΦS(f).
Let n ≥1 and f ∈H . Then, we have
ΦS(f)n =

Then,

By d’Alembert’s ratio test, the inﬁnite series on the right-hand side con-
verges. Hence, Ψk ∈E (ΦS(f)) (the set of entire analytic vectors of ΦS(f);
see Section 1.7). Since any vector in Fb,0(H ) is a linear combination of
vectors of the form Ψk (k ≥0), it follows that Fb,0(H ) ⊂E (ΦS(f)). It is
obvious that ΦS(f)Fb,0(H ) ⊂Fb,0(H ). Hence, by Theorem 1.35, ΦS(f)
is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,0(H ) and hence, ΦS(f) is self-adjoint.
Since Fb,ﬁn(D) ⊂Fb,0(H ) and Fb,ﬁn(D) is dense in Fb(H ), it follows
from an argument similar to that in the second half of Proof (I) that
Fb,ﬁn(D) is a core for ΦS(f).
□
Remark 5.12. One can also prove Theorem 5.23 by an application of the
commutator theorem (Reed and Simon (1975), Theorem X.37), with the
dominating operator being the boson number operator Nb.
5.10.3
Irreducibility of Segal ﬁeld operators
We next consider the irreducibility of the Segal ﬁeld operators.
Theorem 5.24. For any dense subspace D of H , {ΦS(f)|f ∈D} is
irreducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{ΦS(f)|f ∈D}′. Then, for all f ∈D, T ΦS(f) ⊂ΦS(f)T .
Let Df
:= D(A(f)∗) = D(A(f)) (see Corollary 5.6). Hence, for all
Boson Fock Spaces
301
Ψ, Φ ∈Df,
⟨Ψ, T (A(f)∗+ A(f))Φ⟩= ⟨(A(f) + A(f)∗)Ψ, T Φ⟩.
Replacing f by if, one has
⟨Ψ, T (A(f)∗−A(f))Φ⟩= ⟨(A(f) −A(f)∗)Ψ, T Φ⟩.
From these two equations, one obtains
⟨Ψ, T A(f)∗Φ⟩= ⟨A(f)Ψ, T Φ⟩,
⟨Ψ, T A(f)Φ⟩= ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, T Φ⟩.
The ﬁrst equation implies that T Φ ∈D(A(f)∗) and T A(f)∗Φ = A(f)∗T Φ,
i.e., T A(f)∗⊂A(f)∗T . Similarly, the second equation implies that T A(f) ⊂
A(f)T . Hence, T ∈{A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈D}′ = CI (by Theorem 5.15), i.e.,
T = cI, for some c ∈C. Thus, {ΦS(f)|f ∈D} is irreducible.
□
5.11
Exponential Operator for a General Linear Operator
Since ΦS(f) (f ∈H ) is self-adjoint, one can consider, using functional
calculus, an exponential operator
ezΦS(f) =
$
R
ezλdEΦS(f)(λ)
with z ∈C, which is a densely deﬁned closed operator on Fb(H ) (apply
Theorem 1.19(iii)). But it is not necessarily bounded (see Proposition 5.24).
We next study operators of this type. For this purpose, we take here a
mathematical interlude.
In view of Lemma 1.7, it would be natural to extend the concept of expo-
nential operator to a not necessarily self-adjoint operator A on a Hilbert
space X as follows:
D(exp A) :=

Ψ ∈C∞(A)

Ψ ∈D(exp A).

We call the operator exp A the exponential operator of A.
We also deﬁne
E1(A) :=

n=0

(5.122)

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that
E1(A) ⊂D(exp A).
Remark 5.13. In the ﬁrst edition of this book, we took E1(A) as the
domain of exp A. But the set on the right-hand side of (5.120) may be more
natural as the domain of exp A as far as the deﬁnition of exp A is concerned.
We ﬁrst check the properties of exp A in the case where A is bounded
with D(A) = X (i.e., A ∈B(X )).
Proposition 5.19. Let A ∈B(X ). Then:
(i) exp A ∈B(X ) and
exp A =


n=0

(5.123)
in operator norm (see Section 1.3.3).
(ii)
(exp A)∗= exp A∗.
(5.124)
(iii) exp A is bijective with (exp A)−1 = exp(−A).
Proof. (i) By Theorem 1.2, we have ∥An∥≤∥A∥n. Hence, for all M > N

Hence, the inﬁnite series E(A) := ∞
n=0 An/n! converges in operator norm
and E(A) ∈B(X ). In particular, for all Ψ ∈X , ∞
n=0 AnΨ/n! exists
Hence, X = D(exp A) and (exp A)Ψ = E(A)Ψ Therefore, exp A = E(A),
i.e., (5.123) holds.
(ii) Let Ψ, Φ ∈X . Then, by (5.123),
⟨Φ, (exp A)Ψ⟩=

⟨Φ, (exp A)(exp(−A))Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩. This implies that (exp A)(exp(−A)) = I.
Then, taking −A instead of A, we have (exp(−A)) exp A = I. These two
equations imply that exp A is bijective and (exp A)−1 = exp(−A).
□
In the case where A = zS, with S being a self-adjoint operator and
z ∈C, we have the following.
Proposition 5.20. Let S be a self-adjoint operator on X and z ∈C Then,
exp zS ⊂ezS.
(5.125)
Proof. This follows from Lemma 1.7(iii).
□
Remark 5.14. To avoid confusion, we use the symbol ezA only in the case
where A is self-adjoint.
The following proposition is concerned with the relation between exp A
and exp A∗in the case where A ∈L(X ) is densely deﬁned so that the
adjoint A∗exists, but not necessarily bounded:
Proposition 5.21. Let A ∈L(X ) be densely deﬁned. Then, for all Φ ∈
D(exp A∗) and Ψ ∈D(exp A),
⟨Φ, (exp A)Ψ⟩= ⟨(exp A∗)Φ, Ψ⟩.

In particular, if D(exp A) is dense in X in addition, then
exp A∗⊂(exp A)∗.

We next consider the products of exponential operators. But, before
proceeding to do it, we recall a concept on inﬁnite series in a Hilbert space.
For a sequence {Ψn}∞
n=0 in a Hilbert space X , the inﬁnite series ∞
n=0 Ψn
is said to be absolutely convergent if ∞
n=0 ∥Ψn∥X < ∞. In that case,
it is easy to see that Φ := ∞
n=0 Ψn converges in X and, for each bijection
σ : Z+ →Z+, Φσ := ∞
n=0 Ψσ(n) is absolutely convergent with Φσ = Φ.
A double sequence {Ψn,m}∞
n,m=0 in X is said to be absolutely con-
vergent if ∞
n,m=0 ∥Ψn,m∥X
< ∞. In that case, for all n, m ∈Z+,
Φn := ∞
m=0 Ψn,m and Ξm := ∞
n=0 Ψn,m are absolutely convergent, with
∞

In particular, (exp A) ↾E (A) is injective and
((exp A) ↾E (A))−1 = (exp(−A)) ↾E (A).
(ii) Suppose that exp(±A) are closed and E (A) is a core for exp(±A). Then,
(5.129) (resp., (5.130)) holds for all Ψ ∈D(exp A) (resp., D(exp(−A)).

We say that a linear operator A on X (i.e., A ∈L(X )) strongly
commutes with a bounded linear operator C ∈B(X ) if CA ⊂AC.
Lemma 5.14. Let A ∈L(X ) and C ∈B(X ) such that CA ⊂AC (i.e.,
A strongly commutes with C). Then:
(i) E1(A + C) = E1(A) and
exp(A + C)Ψ = (exp C)(exp A)Ψ,
Ψ ∈E1(A).

(ii) If A is closed, then (exp C)E1(A) ⊂E1(A) and
exp(A + C)Ψ = (exp A)(exp C)Ψ,
Ψ ∈E1(A).
(5.132)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈E1(A). By the assumption for C, CD(A) ⊂D(A) and
ACη = CAη, for all η ∈D(A). Hence, for all n, m ∈N, AnCmΨ = CmAnΨ

Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(A, B). Then, Φ := ∞

Hence, by the closedness of A, (exp B)Ψ ∈D(A) and A(exp B)Ψ = Φ =

5.11.1
Commutation relations
In this section, we consider a pair (A, B) of linear operators on X which
has the following property:
(AB) There exist a subspace D ⊂D(A) ∩D(B) and a bounded operator
C ∈B(X ) satisfying the following conditions:
(i) The operators A and B leave D invariant: AD
⊂D and
BD ⊂D.
(ii) [A, B] = C on D (hence CD ⊂D by (i)) and CA = AC and
CB = BC on D.
Remark 5.15. Let Dc be a dense subspace of X such that Dc ⊂D(AB) ∩
D(BA). Suppose that there exists a bijective operator Z ∈B(X ) such that
Boson Fock Spaces
309
(i) [A, B] = Z on Dc; (ii) ZDc ⊂D(A) ∩D(B) and AZ = ZA, BZ =
ZB on Dc. Then, at least one of A and B is unbounded. This proposition
can be easily proved by applying a well-known theorem in the theory of
commutation relations (see, for example, Putnam, 1967, Theorem 1.2.2).
Thus, for a pair (A, B) obeying (AB), at least one of A and B is unbounded
if D is dense and C is bijective.
Lemma 5.16. Assume (AB). Suppose that B is closed and D ⊂D(exp A).
Then, (exp A)D ⊂D(B) and, for all Ψ ∈D,
(exp A)BΨ = (B + C)(exp A)Ψ.
(5.134)
Proof. Since BΨ ∈D ⊂D(exp A), we have
(exp A)BΨ =
∞

n=0
1
n!AnBΨ.
(5.135)
By property (AB), we have
AnBΨ = An−1([A, B] + BA)Ψ = CAn−1Ψ + An−1B(AΨ).
Iterating this formula, we obtain
AnBΨ = nCAn−1Ψ + BAnΨ.
(5.136)
Hence, for all N ∈N,
N

n=0

n!AnBΨ = CΦN−1Ψ + BΦN,
with ΦN := N
n=0(1/n!)AnΨ. By (5.135), limN→∞
N
n=0(1/n!)AnBΨ =
(exp A)BΨ. We have limN→∞ΦN = (exp A)Ψ. Hence, by the boundedness
of C, CΦN−1 →C(exp A)Ψ (N →∞). Therefore, BΦN →(exp A)BΨ −
C(exp A)Ψ (N →∞). Since B is closed, it follows that (exp A)Ψ ∈D(B)
and (5.134) holds.
□
The following proposition is concerned with the commutation relation
between exp A and exp B:
Proposition 5.23. Assume (AB). Suppose that B and exp A are closed:
D ⊂E1(A) ∩E1(B) and (exp A)D ⊂E1(B). Then, (exp B)D ⊂E1(A) and,
for all Ψ ∈D,
(exp A)(exp B)Ψ = (exp C)(exp B)(exp A)Ψ.
310
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D. Using (5.134) repeatedly, we obtain (exp A)BnΨ =
(B +C)n(exp A)Ψ for all n ∈N. Hence, letting χN := N
n=0(1/n!)BnΨ, we
have
(exp A)χN =
N

n=0
1
n!(B + C)n(exp A)Ψ.
By the condition that (exp A)Ψ ∈E1(B) = E1(B + C) (see Lemma 5.14
(i)), the right-hand side converges to (exp(B + C))(exp A)Ψ as N →∞.
Since χN →(exp B)Ψ as N →∞and exp A is closed under the present
assumption, it follows that (exp B)Ψ ∈D(exp A) and (exp A)(exp B)Ψ =
exp(B + C)(exp A)Ψ. In the same way as in the proof of Lemma 5.14, one
can show that, for all Φ ∈E1(B), exp(B + C)Φ = (exp C)(exp B)Φ. Thus,
the desired result follows.

5.11.2
Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀformula
We next examine how exp(A + B) (A, B ∈L(X )) is expressed in terms of
exp A and exp B. For this purpose, we ﬁrst prove a formula on a sum of
elements in an algebra.8
Lemma 5.17. Let A be an algebra over K and X, Y, Z be elements in A
satisfying [X, Y ] = Z, XZ = ZX and Y Z = ZY . Then, for all n ∈N,
n

k=0
nCkXn−kY k =

n!
k!r!
%Z
2
&r
(X + Y )k,
(5.137)
where nCk is the binomial coeﬃcient (see (2.55)).
Proof. We prove (5.137) by induction in n. In the case of n = 1, both sides
of (5.137) are equal to (X + Y ).
8A set A is called an (associative) algebra over K if the following (i) and (ii) hold: (i) A
is a vector space over K. (ii) For each pair (X, Y ) ∈A × A, there exists a unique element
XY ∈A such that, for all X, Y, Z ∈A and α ∈K, (a) (associative law) X(Y Z) = (XY )Z;
(b) (distributive laws) (X + Y )Z = XZ + Y Z, X(Y + Z) = XY + XZ; (c) (scalar
multiplication laws) α(XY ) = (αX)Y = X(αY ). The correspondence (X, Y ) 
→XY is
called the product of X and Y . If there is an element I in A such that, for all X ∈A,
XI = IX = X, then I is called a unit element of A. It is easy to see that a unit
element of an algebra is unique if it exists. An algebra with a unit element is called an
unital algebra. In this book, an algebra means a unital algebra unless otherwise stated.
For all X, X1, . . . , Xn ∈A and n ∈N, we set X0 := I, X1 · · · Xn := (X1 · · · Xn−1)Xn
(deﬁnition inductive in n) and Xn := X · · · X

Suppose that (5.137) holds for an n ∈N. Let the left-hand side of (5.137)
be Ln. By the recursion formula
n+1Ck = nCk + nCk−1,
k = 1, . . . , n,
(5.138)
and the induction hypothesis, we have
Ln+1 =

&r
{X(X + Y )k + (X + Y )kY }.
On the other hand, using the commutation relation [X, Y ] = Z, we obtain
X(X + Y )k = kZ(X + Y )k−1 + (X + Y )kX,
k ≥1.
Hence,
Ln+1 = 2

k!(r −1)! +
n!
(k −1)!r! = (n + 1)!
k!r!

r, k ≥1.
Putting this into the above equation, we see that Ln+1 is equal to the right-
hand side of (5.137), with n replaced by n + 1. Thus, (5.137) holds with n
replaced by n + 1.
□
Remark 5.16. If X and Y commute in Lemma 5.17, i.e., Z = 0, then
(5.137) yields the binomial theorem. Hence, (5.137) may be regarded as a
kind of non-commutative extension of the binomial theorem.

Then, by Proposition 5.19(iii), (5.139) is obtained.
□
Remark 5.17. If A and B are bounded in Theorem 5.25, then one can
take D = X . Hence, the operator equality
exp(A + B) = exp(−C/2)(exp A)(exp B)
holds. This is a special form of the so-called Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ
(BCH) formula. Hence, (5.139) gives its generalization to the case where
A and B are not necessarily bounded (see Remark 5.15).

Exponential Operators for Segal Field Operators
Now, we come back to the boson Fock space Fb(H ). We have seen that,
for each f ∈H , ΦS(f) is self-adjoint. Hence, for all t ∈R, eitΦS(f) is a
unitary operator on Fb(H ). The unitary operator eitΦS(f) is called the
Weyl operator with f. However, for a non-zero complex number z which
is not purely imaginary, ezΦS(f) with f ̸= 0 being unbounded.
Boson Fock Spaces
313
Proposition 5.24. Let f ∈H and f ̸= 0.
(i) For all t ∈R \ {0}, etΦS(f) is an unbounded non-negative self-adjoint
operator and injective with (etΦS(f))−1 = e−tΦS(f).
(ii) For all z = a + ib ∈C with a, b ∈R, a ̸= 0, ezΦS(f) is a densely deﬁned
unbounded closed operator and (ezΦS(f))∗= ez∗ΦS(f) and injective with
(ezΦS(f))−1 = e−zΦS(f).
Proof. (i) The function R ∋λ →etλ is strictly positive and continuous.
Hence, by Corollary 1.4(ii), etΦS is a non-negative injective self-adjoint oper-
ator, with (etΦS(f))−1 = e−tΦS(f). By Proposition 5.17, ΦS(f) is neither
bounded from below nor bounded from above. Hence, by an application of
Proposition 1.46(ii), etΦS(f) is unbounded for all t ∈R \ {0}.
(ii) The function R ∋λ →ezλ is continuous and |ezλ| = eaλ > 0, λ ∈
R. Hence, by the functional calculus, ezΦS(f) is a densely deﬁned closed
operator and (ezΦS(f))∗= ez∗ΦS(f) since (ezλ)∗= ez∗λ. The injectivity of
ezΦS(f) follows from an application of Corollary 1.4(i).
Using functional calculus, we have ezΦS(f) = eibΦS(f)eaΦS(f). Hence, for
all Ψ ∈D(ezΦS(f)) = D(eaΦS), ∥ezΦS(f)Ψ∥= ∥eaΦS(f)Ψ∥. This implies that,
if ezΦS(f) is bounded, then so is eaΦS(f). But, by (i), eaΦS(f) is unbounded.
Thus, ezΦS(f) is unbounded.

Therefore, ezΦS(f)Ψ ∈E (ΦS(g)). It follows from (5.144) that the inﬁnite
series on the right-hand side of (5.143) with X = wΦS(g) and Y = zΦS(f)
absolutely converges. By this fact and the preceding result, we see that
(5.143) with X = wΦS(g) and Y = zΦS(f) holds. Similarly, one can prove
the statement of (iii) in the other cases.
□
Now, we are ready to prove important facts about exponential operators
for the Segal ﬁeld operator. We ﬁrst note the following.

Proof. In the framework in Section 5.11, we consider the case where
A = zA(f)∗/
√
2, B = zA(f)/
√
2, X = Fb(H ) and D = Fb,0(H ). Then,
Assumption(AB) in Section 5.11.1 is satisﬁed with C = −z2∥f∥2/2. More-
over, the assumption of Theorem 5.25 is also satisﬁed. Hence, by Theorem
5.25, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), exp(A + B)Ψ = e−z2∥f∥2/4(exp A)(exp B)Ψ. By
Lemma 5.18(i), we have exp(A + B)Ψ = ezΦS(f)Ψ. Thus, (5.145) follows.□
Theorem 5.27. Let f, g ∈H .
(i) For all z ∈C and Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ),
ezΦS(f+g)Ψ = e−iz2Im⟨f,g⟩/2ezΦS(f)ezΦS(g)Ψ.
(5.147)
(ii) The following operator equalities hold:
eiΦS(f+g) = eiIm⟨f,g⟩/2eiΦS(f)eiΦS(g),
(5.148)
eiΦS(f)eiΦS(g) = e−iIm⟨f,g⟩eiΦS(g)eiΦS(f).
(5.149)
(iii) (strong continuity) Let fn ∈H and fn →f (n →∞). Then,
s- lim
n→∞eiΦS(fn) = eiΦS(f).
(5.150)
(iv) (irreducibility) For any dense subspace D ⊂H , {eiΦS(f)|f ∈D} is
irreducible.
(v) For any dense subspace D ⊂H , span {eiΦS(f)ΩH |f ∈D} is dense in
Fb(H ).
(vi) Let D be a dense subspace of H and g1, . . . , gn ∈H (n ∈N). Then,
span {eiΦS(f)A(g1)∗· · · A(gn)∗ΩH |f ∈D} is dense in Fb(H ).
Proof. (i) In the framework in Section 5.11, let A = zΦS(f), B = zΦS(g),
X = Fb(H ) and D = Fb,0(H ). Then, the pair (A, B) satisﬁes property
(AB) in Section 5.11.1, with C = iz2Im ⟨f, g⟩. By Lemma 5.18 (the inﬁ-
nite series expansion for ezΦS(f+g)Ψ), one can easily see that ezΦS(f+g)Ψ =
exp(zA + zB)Ψ. By Lemma 5.18 again, one sees that the assumption of
Theorem 5.25 is satisﬁed in the present case. Hence, exp(zA + zB)Ψ =
e−iz2Im ⟨f,g⟩/2 exp(zA) exp(zB)Ψ. Hence, (5.147) holds.

(ii) Taking z = i in (5.147), we have (5.148) on Fb,0(H ). Since
Fb,0(H ) is dense in Fb(H ) and eiΦS(h) (h ∈H ) is bounded, operator
equality (5.148) follows from Theorem 1.1.
By (5.148) and eiΦS(f+g) = eiΦS(g+f), we have
eiIm⟨f,g⟩/2eiΦS(f)eiΦS(g) = eiIm⟨g,f⟩/2eiΦS(g)eiΦS(f).
Using this relation and the fact that Im ⟨f, g⟩= −Im ⟨g, f⟩, we obtain
(5.149).
(iii) Let Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ). Then, by direct computation, we have

By (5.148),
e−iΦS(fn)eiΦS(f)Ψ = eiIm ⟨fn,f⟩/2eiΦS(f−fn)Ψ.

We have limn→∞Im ⟨fn, f⟩= Im ∥f∥2 = 0. By Propositions 1.45 and
5.18(iv) with T = I,
∥eiΦS(f−fn)Ψ −Ψ∥≤∥ΦS(f −fn)Ψ∥→0 (n →∞).
Hence, the right-hand side of the above equation converges to 0 as n →∞.
Thus,
lim
n→∞eiΦS(fn)Ψ = eiΦS(f)Ψ.
Since Fb,0(H ) is dense in Fb(H ) and supn≥1 ∥eiΦS(fn)∥= 1 < ∞, a
simple application of Proposition A.3 in Appendix A gives (5.150).
(iv) Let T ∈{eiΦS(f)|f ∈D}′. Then, for all f ∈D, t ∈R and
Ψ
∈D(ΦS(f)), T eitΦS(f)Ψ
= eitΦS(f)T Ψ. Since eitΦS(f)Ψ is strongly
diﬀerentiable in t and T is bounded, it follows that eitΦS(f)T Ψ is also
strongly diﬀerentiable in t. Hence, considering the strong diﬀerentiation
of the above equation at t = 0, one obtains that T Ψ ∈D(ΦS(f)) and
T ΦS(f)Ψ = ΦS(f)T Ψ. This means that T ΦS(f) ⊂ΦS(f)T . Therefore,
T ∈{ΦS(f)|f ∈D}′. Hence, by Theorem 5.24, T = cI for some c ∈C.
Thus, {eiΦS(f)|f ∈D} is irreducible.

By repeating this procedure, we ﬁnally obtain

M = {0} as desired.

⟨Ψ, ΦS(f1) · · · ΦS(fm)A(g1)∗· · · A(gn)∗ΩH ⟩= 0.
By (5.114) and (5.115), this implies that, for all h1, . . . , hm ∈D,
⟨Ψ, A(f1)∗· · · A(fm)∗A(g1) · · · A(gn)A(g1)∗· · · A(gn)∗ΩH ⟩= 0.
Note that A(g1) · · · A(gn)A(g1)∗· · · A(gn)∗ΩH = αΩH , for some constant
α ∈C. Hence, ⟨Ψ, A(f1)∗· · · A(fm)∗ΩH ⟩= 0. Thus, Ψ = 0.

Commutation property (5.149) for the Weyl operators eiΦS(f) and eiΦS(g)
is called the Weyl relation for ΦS(f) and ΦS(g). This implies an important
result.
Corollary 5.11 (Strong commutativity). Let f, g ∈H . Then, ΦS(f)
and ΦS(g) strongly commute if and only if Im ⟨f, g⟩= 0.
Proof. Suppose that ΦS(f) and ΦS(g) strongly commute. Then, by Propo-
sition 1.48, for all s, t ∈R, eitΦS(f)eisΦS(g) = eisΦS(g)eitΦS(f). Hence, by
(5.149), e−itsIm ⟨f,g⟩= 1, for all s, t ∈R. Hence, Im ⟨f, g⟩= 0.
Conversely, suppose that Im ⟨f, g⟩= 0. Then, Im ⟨tf, sg⟩= 0, s, t ∈
R. Using the real linearity of ΦS(f) in f
and (5.149), we obtain
Boson Fock Spaces
319
eitΦS(f)eisΦS(g) = eisΦS(g)eitΦS(f). Hence, by Proposition 1.48 again, ΦS(f)
and ΦS(g) strongly commute.

Decomposition of the Segal Field Operator
Let C be a conjugation on H , i.e., C is anti-linear mapping from H to
H satisfying (i) C2 = I and (ii) (norm preserving) ∥Cf∥= ∥f∥, f ∈H .10
Then, it is easy to see that
⟨Cf, Cg⟩= ⟨g, f⟩,
f, g ∈H
and
HC := {f ∈H | Cf = f}
becomes a real Hilbert space with the inner product induced from that
of H . Note also that each f ∈H is uniquely written as
f = f1 + if2,
with f1, f2 ∈HC (explicitly f1 = 1
2(f + Cf), f2 = 1
2i(f −Cf)). The vector
f1 (resp., f2) is called the real (resp., imaginary) part of f with respect to
C and written as f1 = Re f and f2 = Im f.
For a subspace V of H , we deﬁne VC by
VC := V ∩HC.
(5.151)
It follows that, if V is dense in H and CV ⊂V , then VC is dense in HC.
For each f ∈H , we introduce operators φF(f) and πF(f) by
φF(f) :=
1
√
2
(A(f)∗+ A(Cf)),
(5.152)
πF(f) :=
i
√
2(A(f)∗−A(Cf)).
(5.153)
Note that φF(f) and πF(f) on Fb,0(H ) are complex linear in f, but not
symmetric unless Cf = f. The operators φF(f) and πF(f) depend on the
choice of C; however, for notational simplicity, we suppress C.
10A simple example of C is given as follows: Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H . Then,
any ψ ∈H has the expansion ψ = ∞
n=1 ⟨en, ψ⟩en. One can deﬁne C : H →H by
Cψ := ∞
n=1 ⟨ψ, en⟩en. It is easy to see that C is a conjugation on H .
320
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows from Theorem 5.14 that, for all f, g ∈H , the following com-
mutation relations hold on Fb,0(H ):
[φF(f), πF(g)] = i ⟨Cf, g⟩,
(5.154)
[φF(f), φF(g)] = 0,
[πF(f), πF(g)] = 0.
(5.155)
We call the mapping f →φF(f) the canonical ﬁeld over (H , C) and the
mapping f →πF(f) the canonical conjugate momentum over (H , C).
Remark 5.18. In applications to quantum ﬁeld theory, φF(·) and πF(·)
are used to represent a canonical pair of quantum ﬁelds at time zero (i.e.,
time-zero quantum ﬁelds)(see Chapter 10). The names for φF(·) and πF(·)
are taken from this context.
The operators φF(f) and πF(f) are written in terms of the Segal ﬁeld
operator:
φF(f) = ΦS(f),
πF(f) = ΦS(if)
(f ∈HC).
(5.156)
But note that φF(f) ̸= ΦS(f) ↾D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗) ∩D(A(Cf)) if
Im f ̸= 0. Hence, for all f ∈H ,
φF(f) = ΦS(Re f) + iΦS(Im f),
(5.157)
πF(f) = ΦS(iRe f) + iΦS(iIm f)
(5.158)
on D(A(Re f)) ∩D(A(Re f)∗) ∩D(A(Im f)) ∩D(A(Im f)∗).
The Segal ﬁeld operator is recovered from φF(·) and πF(·) in the follow-
ing form: for all f ∈H ,
ΦS(f) = φF(Re f) + πF(Im f)
on Fb,0(H ). By (5.148), we have
eiΦS(f) = ei⟨Re f,Im f⟩/2eiφF(Re f)eiπF(Im f).
Proposition 5.18(i) and Theorems 5.23, 5.24 and 5.27 immediately yield
the following theorem.
Theorem 5.28.
(i) For all f ∈HC, φF(f) and πF(f) are self-adjoint and essentially
self-adjoint on Fb,0(H ), leaving Fb,0(H ) invariant.
Boson Fock Spaces
321
(ii) For all f, g ∈HC, the commutation relations
[φF(f), πF(g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
(5.159)
[φF(f), φF(g)] = 0,
[πF(f), πF(g)] = 0,
(5.160)
hold on Fb,0(H ).
(iii) For any dense subspace D
⊂HC, {eiφF(f), eiπF(f) | f
∈D} is
irreducible.
(iv) For any dense subspace D ⊂HC, {φF(f), πF(f)| f ∈D} is irreducible.
(v) For all f, g ∈HC,
eiφF(f+g) = eiφF(f)eiφF(g),
eiπF(f+g) = eiπF(f)eiπF(g),
eiφF(f)eiπF(g) = e−i⟨f,g⟩eiπF(g)eiφF(f),
eiφF(f)eiφF(g) = eiφF(g)eiφF(f), eiπF(f)eiπF(g) = eiπF(g)eiπF(f).
In particular, {φF(f) | f ∈HC} (resp., {πF(f) | f ∈HC}) is a family
of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators.
Commutation relations (5.159) and (5.160) may be regarded as a gener-
alization of Heisenberg CCR with ﬁnite degrees of freedom (see Remark on
Problem 5 in Chapter 3). Indeed, if dim H = n ∈N and we take a CONS
{ej}n
j=1 of HC, then the operators Qj := ℏsφF(ej) and Pj := ℏ1−sπF(ej)
(s ∈[0, 1], j = 1, . . . , n) satisfy
[Qj, Pk] = iℏδjk, [Qj, Qk] = 0, [Pj, Pk] = 0 (j, k = 1, . . . , n)
on Fb,0(H ).
We call commutation relations (5.159) and (5.160) the Heisenberg
CCR over HC to distinguish them from the CCR satisﬁed by A(·)#’s.11
In particular, if H is inﬁnite dimensional, then the Heisenberg CCR over
HC is said to be a Heisenberg CCR with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.

Before moving on to the next theorem, we present a basic fact used in

no danger of confusion.

Here, we recall a general fact which is often used in the following.
Lemma 5.20. Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces and U : H1 →H2 be
a unitary operator. Let A1 and A2 be closed operators on H1 and H2,
respectively. Suppose that, for j = 1, 2, there exists a core Dj for Aj and
the following equations hold:
UA1U −1Φ = A2Φ,
Φ ∈D2,
(5.164)
U −1A2UΨ = A1Ψ,
Ψ ∈D1.
(5.165)
Then, the operator equality
UA1U −1 = A2
(5.166)
holds.
Proof. Equation (5.164) implies that A2 ↾D2 ⊂UA1U −1. Since UA1U −1
is closed, it follows that A2 = A2 ↾D2 ⊂UA1U −1. Similarly, (5.165) implies
that A1 ⊂U −1A2U. Hence, UA1U −1 ⊂A2. Thus, (5.166) holds.

Spectrum of Segal Field Operators
We next identify the spectrum of ΦS(f).
Theorem 5.31. Let f ∈H , f ̸= 0.
(i) σ(ΦS(f)) = R.
(ii) If H is separable, then σp(ΦS(f)) = ∅.
13Another proof is given by applying the following general fact: for any densely deﬁned
closed operator A on a Hilbert space H and any unitary operator U : H →K (K is a
Hilbert space), the operator equality (UAU−1)∗= UA∗U−1 holds.
14For any closable operator A on a Hilbert space H and any unitary unitary operator
U : H →K (a Hilbert space), UAU−1 is closable and UAU−1 = U ¯
AU−1.
Boson Fock Spaces
325
Proof. Let t ∈R and take g = itf in (5.169). Then,
eiΦS(itf)ΦS(f)e−iΦS(itf) = ΦS(f) + t∥f∥2.
Since eiΦS(itf) is unitary, it follows that
σ#(ΦS(f)) = σ#(ΦS(f) + t∥f∥2) = {λ + t∥f∥2|λ ∈σ#(ΦS(f))},
where σ#(·) is either σ(·) or σp(·).
(i) By the self-adjointness of ΦS(f), σ(ΦS(f)) ̸= ∅. Hence, there exists
a λ0 ∈σ(ΦS(f)). Therefore, σ(ΦS(F)) ⊃∪t∈R{λ0 + t∥f∥2} = R. Thus, the
desired result follows.
(ii) Suppose that σp(ΦS(f)) ̸= ∅and λ ∈σp(ΦS(f)). Then, for all t ∈R,
λ + t∥f∥2 ∈σp(ΦS(f)). Hence, σp(ΦS(f)) is an uncountable set. If H
is separable, then Fb(H ) is separable. In general, the cardinality of the
point spectrum of a closed Hermitian operator on a separable Hilbert space
is at most countable.15 Hence, we are led to a contradiction. Thus, σp
(ΦS(f)) = ∅.
□

Transformation Laws of Creation and Annihilation
Operators with Respect to Γ-Operators
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces. Let U : H →K be unitary. Then, the
boson Γ-operator Γb(U) : Fb(H ) →Fb(K ) is unitary (Theorem 5.7(ii)).
For deﬁniteness, we write the annihilation operator A(·) on Fb(H )
as AH (·).
Theorem 5.32. For all f ∈H , the following operator equalities hold:
Γb(U)AH (f)Γb(U)−1 = AK (Uf),
(5.171)
Γb(U)AH (f)∗Γb(U)−1 = AK (Uf)∗.
(5.172)
In particular,
Γb(U)ΦS,H (f)Γb(U)−1 = ΦS,K (Uf),
(5.173)
where ΦS,H (·) is the Segal ﬁeld operator on Fb(H ).
15This can be proved as follows. Let X be a separable inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space
and H be a closed Hermitian operator on X . Suppose that H had an uncountable set
{λα}α∈Λ ⊂R (λα ̸= λβ for α ̸= β) of eigenvalues, where Λ is an uncountable index
set. Then, ⊕α∈Λ ker(H −λα) ⊂X is a non-separable Hilbert space. But this is a
contradiction because a separable Hilbert space includes no non-separable Hilbert space.
Hence, the cardinality of σp(H) is at most countable.
326
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. For all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), f ∈H and n ∈N,
(Γb(U)AH (f)∗Ψ)(n) = √nSn(Uf ⊗(⊗n−1UΨ (n−1)))
= (AK (Uf)∗Γb(U)Ψ)(n).
Hence, Γb(U)AH (f)∗Ψ
= AK (Uf)∗Γb(U)Ψ. For all Φ ∈Fb,0(K ),
Γb(U)−1Φ ∈Fb,0(H ). Hence, Γ(U)AH (f)∗Γb(U)−1Φ = AK (Uf)∗Φ. Sim-
ilarly, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), AH (f)∗Ψ = Γb(U)−1AK (Uf)∗Γb(U)Ψ. Since
Fb,0(H ) is a core for AH (·)∗, an application of Lemma 5.20 gives (5.172).
Taking the adjoint of (5.172), we obtain (5.171).
Operator equality (5.173) can be proved in the same way as we proved
Corollary 5.12.
□
Corollary 5.13. For all f ∈H , the following operator equalities hold:
eiπNbA(f)e−iπNb = −A(f),
(5.174)
eiπNbA(f)∗e−iπNb = −A(f)∗.
(5.175)
In particular,
eiπNbΦS(f)e−iπNb = −ΦS(f).
(5.176)
Proof. We have eiπNb
= Γ(eiπ) = Γ(−I). Hence, an application of
Theorem 5.32 to the case U = −I gives the desired results.
□
Formulae (5.174)–(5.176) show that the correspondences: A(f)# →
−A(f)# and ΦS(f) →−ΦS(f) are unitarily implementable. These facts
play important roles in applications to quantum ﬁeld theory.
5.17
Time Development of Segal Field Operators
and Field Equations
In general, for a self-adjoint operator H on a Hilbert space X and a linear
operator A on X , the operator
AH(t) := eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ
(t ∈R)
(5.177)
is called the Heisenberg operator of A with respect to H. In the context
of quantum physics where H denotes a quantum Hamiltonian, A is a phys-
ical quantity and t denotes time, AH(t) is interpreted as the operator
describing the time development of A. This way of looking at the time
development of a quantum system is called the Heisenberg picture. On
Boson Fock Spaces
327
the other hand, there is another picture, called the Schr¨odinger picture,
in which the time development of a quantum system is grasped as that of
state vectors in such a way that, if Ψ ∈X is an initial state vector (i.e., a
state vector at t = 0), then the state vector at time t is given by e−itH/ℏΨ.
Let T be a self-adjoint operator on H . Then, as we have seen, the
boson second quantization dΓb(T ) of T is self-adjoint. In applications
to quantum ﬁeld theory, if T denotes the Hamiltonian of a boson, then
dΓb(T ) represents the Hamiltonian of a free Bose ﬁeld whose quanta con-
sist of non-interacting identical bosons. In that case, the unitary operator
e−itdΓb(T )/ℏdescribes the time development of state vectors of the sys-
tem under consideration. It is also important to consider the Heisenberg
operator eitdΓb(T )/ℏAe−itdΓb(T )/ℏof a linear operator A on Fb(H ) with
respect to dΓb(T ).
Let us consider the case A = ΦS(f) with f ∈H . Then, the time
development of the Segal ﬁeld operator ΦS(f) with respect to dΓb(T ) is
given by
ΦS(t, f) := eitdΓb(T )ΦS(f)e−itdΓb(T ),
where, for notational simplicity, we replace t/ℏby t.
The purpose of this section is to study the strong diﬀerentiability of
ΦS(t, f) in t and to ﬁnd the diﬀerential equations it obeys.
Lemma 5.21. For all t ∈R and f ∈H , the operator equalities
eitdΓb(T )A(f)#e−itdΓb(T ) = A(eitT f)#,
(5.178)
ΦS(t, f) = ΦS(eitT f)
(5.179)
hold.
Proof. We need only to apply Theorem 5.32 to U
= eitT and use
Theorem 5.8(i).
□
By Lemma 5.21, we need only to examine the strong diﬀerentiability in
t of the operator ΦS(eitT f) for the purpose mentioned above.
Lemma 5.22. Let S be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator
on H
strongly commuting with T . Let n ∈N, f ∈D(T S−1/2T n−1) ∩
D(T n)
and
Ψ
∈
D(dΓb(S)1/2).
Then,
the
vector-valued
function

R ∋t →A(eitT f)#Ψ is n times strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
dn
dtn A(eitT f)#Ψ = A(ineitT T nf)#Ψ,
t ∈R,
(5.180)
where d/dt means strong diﬀerentiation in t.
Proof. We prove the statement by induction in n. So, we ﬁrst consider
the case n = 1 and assume that f ∈D(T S−1/2) ∩D(T ). Let F(t) =
A(eitT f)#Ψ. Then, for any t ∈R and ε ∈R \ {0},
F(t + ε) −F(t)
ε
−A(ieitT T f)#Ψ = A(hε(t, f))#Ψ,
where
hε(t, f) := eitT
)(eiεT −1)f
ε
−iT f
*
.
By the strong commutativity of S and T , S−1/2 strongly commutes with T .
Hence, eitT S−1/2 ⊂S−1/2eitT , for all t ∈R. It follows that D(T S−1/2) ∩
D(T ) ⊂D(S−1/2T ) and S−1/2T f = T S−1/2f. Hence, hε(t, f) ∈D(S−1/2)
and S−1/2hε(t, f) = hε(t, S−1/2f), By Theorem 5.17, we have
∥A(hε(t, f))#Ψ∥≤∥S−1/2hε(t, f)∥∥dΓb(S)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥hε(t, f)∥∥Ψ∥
= ∥hε(t, S−1/2f)∥∥dΓb(S)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥hε(t, f)∥∥Ψ∥.
Using the spectral representation

g ∈D(T ),
one can show that limε→0 hε(t, g) = 0, for all g ∈D(T ). Hence, F(t) is
strongly diﬀerentiable in t and (5.180) with n = 1 holds.
Suppose that the conclusion of the present lemma holds for some n ∈N.
To prove that the case n + 1 holds, let f ∈D(T S−1/2T n) ∩D(T n+1) and
G(t) = A(ineitT T nf)#Ψ. Then, one can write G(t) = A(eitT g)#Ψ with
g := inT nf. By the induction hypothesis, g ∈D(T S−1/2) ∩D(T ). Hence,
by the preceding result on n = 1, G(t) is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
dG(t)/dt = A(ieitT T g)#Ψ. Thus, the conclusion in the case n + 1 holds.
□
Remark 5.19. A standard choice for S in Lemma 5.22 is given by the
case S = I. In this case, the strong commutativity of T and S is trivial and
(5.180) holds for all f ∈D(T n) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Another simple case is
Boson Fock Spaces
329
that of S = T under the condition that T is non-negative and injective. In
this case, (5.180) holds for all f ∈D(T n) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2).
The following theorem follows from (5.179) and Lemma 5.22.
Theorem 5.33. Let S be as in Lemma 5.22 and f ∈D(T S−1/2T )∩D(T 2).
Then, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(S)1/2), the vector-valued function R ∋t →
ΦS(t, f)Ψ is twice strongly diﬀerentiable and obeys the diﬀerential equation

Abstract Free Bose Fields
In this section, we construct an abstract quantum ﬁeld model. Let HC
be as in Section 5.13 and T be an injective and non-negative self-adjoint
operator on H such that CT ⊂T C (i.e., for all f ∈D(T ), Cf ∈D(T ) and
T Cf = CT f, in particular, T (D(T ) ∩HC) ⊂HC). Then, it is easy to see
that CT C = T . Hence, using Stone’s formula, we obtain
ET (·) = CET (·)C.
Therefore, it follows that, for all Borel measurable functions G : R →C,
G(T ) = CG∗(T )C. In particular, for all real-valued Borel measurable func-
tions F, F(T ) = CF(T )C. Hence, for all f ∈D(F(T )), Cf ∈D(F(T )) and
F(T )Cf = CF(T )f. Hence,
F(T )(D(F(T )) ∩HC) ⊂HC.
(5.183)
Let a ∈R and F(λ) = |λ|aχ(0,∞)(λ), λ ∈R, where χ(0,∞) is the char-
acteristic function16 of (0, ∞). Then, it follows from (5.183) that, for all
f ∈D(T a) ∩HC), T af ∈HC.
We take as a Hamiltonian
H0 := dΓb(T ).
Let φF(·) and πF(·) be the operators deﬁned by (5.152) and (5.153)
and α ∈R. Then, (5.159) and (5.160) imply the following commutation
relations: for all f, f ′ ∈D(T −α) ∩HC and g, g′ ∈D(T α) ∩HC,
[φF(T −αf), πF(T αg)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
16See (1.37).
330
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
[φF(T −αf), φF(T −αf ′)] = 0,
[πF(T αg), πF(T αg′)] = 0
on Fb,0(H ). We take as time-zero ﬁelds {φF(T −αf), πF(T αg)|f
∈
D(T −α) ∩sHC, g ∈D(T α) ∩HC}. Then, their time developments are
given by
φα(t, f) := eitH0φF(T −αf)e−itH0,
(5.184)
πα(t, g) := eitH0πF(T αg)e−itH0,
t ∈R.
(5.185)
By (5.179), we have
φα(t, f) = ΦS(eitT T −αf),
(5.186)
πα(t, g) = ΦS(ieitT T αg).
(5.187)
It follows that, for all t ∈R, f, f ′ ∈D(T −α) ∩HC and g, g′ ∈D(T α) ∩HC,
[φα(t, f), πα(t, g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
[φα(t, f), φα(t, f ′)] = 0,
[πα(t, g), φα(t, g′)] = 0
on Fb,0(H ). Hence, for each t ∈R, {φα(t, f), πα(t, g) | f ∈D(T −α) ∩
HC, g ∈D(T α) ∩HC} obeys the Heisenberg CCR on Fb,0(H ).
Applying Theorem 5.33 to φα(t, f) = ΦS(t, T −αf), we obtain the fol-
lowing result.
Corollary 5.14. Let T be an injective and non-negative self-adjoint oper-
ator on H such that CT ⊂T C and f ∈D(T −α) ∩D(T 1−2α) ∩D(T 2−α) ∩
D(T 2) ∩HC. Then, for all Ψ
∈D(H1/2
0
), the vector-valued function
R ∋t →φα(t, f)Ψ is twice strongly diﬀerentiable and obeys the diﬀerential
equations
d
dtφα(t, f)Ψ = πα(t, T 1−2αf)Ψ,
(5.188)
d2
dt2 φα(t, f)Ψ + φα(t, T 2f)Ψ = 0.
(5.189)
In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, (Fb(H ), H0, {φα(t, f), πα(t, f)|
t ∈R, f ∈D(T −α)∩D(T 1−2α)∩D(T 2−α)∩D(T 2)∩HC}) gives a quantum
ﬁeld model on an abstract level. Equation (5.189) is a linear equation on
Boson Fock Spaces
331
φα(t, f) and does not describe any interactions between φα(t, f) with itself
or other quantum ﬁelds. For this reason, φα(t, f) is called an abstract free
Bose ﬁeld and H0 is called a free Hamiltonian.
It follows from (5.12) that
H0ΩH = 0.
(5.190)
By Theorem 5.2(ii), we have H0 ≥0. Hence, the Fock vacuum ΩH is a
ground state of H0, with the ground state energy being zero (see Section
4.8).
If α = 1/2, then
φ1/2(t, f) = ΦS(eitT T −1/2f),
f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩HC,
(5.191)
π1/2(t, g) = ΦS(ieitT T 1/2g),
g ∈D(T 1/2g) ∩HC,
(5.192)
and (5.188) takes the following form:
d
dtφ1/2(t, f)Ψ = π1/2(t, f)Ψ.
(5.193)
In applications to quantum ﬁeld theory, Equations (5.193) and (5.189) with
α = 1/2 give an abstract form of equations that relativistic free Bose ﬁelds
obey (see Chapter 10).
Remark 5.20. A mathematical theory of Heisenberg operators is given by
Arai (2007).
5.19
Vacuum Expectation Values
For a linear operator X on the boson Fock space Fb(H ) such that ΩH ∈
D(X), a complex number ⟨ΩH , XΩH ⟩is deﬁned. This number is called
the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of X.
Let us calculate the VEVs of products of the Segal ﬁeld operators.

We ﬁrst consider the case where m is odd, i.e., m = 2n −1 (n ∈N).
Suppose that F2n−1 = 0, for all f1, . . . , f2n−1 ∈H . Then, by (5.196),
F2(n+1)−1 = F2n+1 is written as a ﬁnite sum of numbers of F2n−1’s type.
Hence, F2(n+1)−1 = 0. Thus, by induction, (5.194) holds.
We next consider the case where m is even, i.e., m = 2n. By (5.196)
with m = 2, (5.195) with n = 1 holds. Suppose that (5.195) holds for some
n ∈N. By (5.196) with m = 2(n + 1), we have

With regard to the VEV of ezΦS(f) (z ∈C, f ∈H ), we have the follow-

Another proof. By (5.54), we have

z ∈C, f ∈H .
(5.199)
Hence, by (5.145), we obtain

Therefore, (5.197) holds.

Coherent Vectors
5.20.1
Deﬁnition and basic properties
By Lemma 5.18(i), for all f ∈H , the Fock vacuum ΩH is an entire analytic
vector of A(f)∗. Hence, the vector
exp f :=
∞

n=0
1
n!A(f)∗nΩH ∈Fb(H )
exists, which is called the coherent vector associated with f. We have
exp f = (exp A(f)∗)ΩH .
It is obvious that exp 0 = ΩH . If f ̸= 0, then exp f ̸= ΩH . A coherent
vector exp f is said to be non-trivial if f ̸= 0.
Remark 5.21. In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, a coherent vector
multiplied by a non-zero complex number is called a coherent state. A
non-trivial coherent state is a quantum state whose n-particle component
(n ∈Z+) is of the form αA(f)∗nΩH /n! ̸= 0, with f ∈H \ {0} and a
complex number α ̸= 0.
By the continuity of inner product, we have, for all f, g ∈H ,
⟨exp f, exp g⟩= lim
N→∞

n,m=0
1
n!m! ⟨A(f)∗nΩH , A(g)∗mΩH ⟩.
336
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Then, by (5.61), we obtain
⟨exp f, exp g⟩= e⟨f,g⟩,
f, g ∈H .
(5.201)
In particular,
∥exp f∥= e∥f∥2/2.
(5.202)
Hence, a normalized coherent vector is given by
Υf := e−∥f∥2/2 exp f.
(5.203)
We have, for all n ∈N and fj ∈H (j = 1, . . . , n),
⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , exp f⟩=
n

j=1
⟨fj, f⟩.
(5.204)
The following theorem describes the basic properties of coherent vectors.
Theorem 5.37.
(i) If the vectors f1, . . . , fn ∈H are linearly independent, then exp f1,
. . . , exp fn are linearly independent.
(ii) If D is a dense subspace of H , then the subspace algebraically spanned
by the coherent vectors exp f, with f ∈D being dense in Fb(H ):
Fb(H ) = span {exp f|f ∈D}.
Proof. (i) Let n
j=1 αj exp fj = 0 with αj ∈C, j = 1, . . . , n. Then, for all
m ≥0, n
j=1 αjA(fj)∗mΩH = 0. In particular, n
j=1 αjA(fj)∗ΩH = 0,
which implies that n
j=1 αjfj = 0. Since {f1, . . . , fn} is linearly indepen-
dent, it follows that αj = 0, j = 1, . . . , n.
(ii) We need only to show that {exp f | f ∈D}⊥= {0}. Let Ψ ∈
{exp f | f ∈D}⊥. Then, for all f ∈D and z ∈C, ⟨Ψ, exp(zf)⟩= 0. Hence,

Therefore, for all n ≥0,
 
Ψ (n), A(f)∗nΩH
!
= 0. The case n = 0 gives
Ψ (0) = 0. Let n ≥1 next. Since f ∈D is arbitrary, we can take
Boson Fock Spaces
337
f = n
j=1 zjfj, with z1, . . . , zn ∈C and f1, . . . , fn ∈D arbitrary. Then, we
have

where
aℓ1···ℓn :=

#
.
Diﬀerentiating both sides of (5.205) in z1, . . . , zn once, respectively,
we obtain a1···1 = 0. Hence,
 
Ψ (n), A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
!
= 0. Since
span {A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH |fj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , n} is dense in ⊗n
s H , it fol-
lows that Ψ (n) = 0. Thus, Ψ = 0.
□
In view of Theorem 5.37(ii), Fb(H ) is written as exp(H ) and called
the exponential Hilbert space associated with H .

ezΦS(f)ΩH = ez2∥f∥2/4 exp zf

This formula expresses the coherent vector exp f in terms of the Segal ﬁeld

Let Υf be the normalized coherent vector deﬁned by (5.203) with f ̸= 0.
Then, its n-particle component is given by
Υ(n)
f

n ≥0.

(5.209)
Let
N b := ⟨Υf, NbΥf⟩∈R.
(5.210)

Hence,

(5.211)
In the context of quantum ﬁeld theory, the real number Nb, deﬁned
by (5.210), physically means the expectation value of the boson number
operator Nb with respect to the coherent state Υf. Hence, (5.211) shows
that the square ∥f∥2 of the vector f generating the coherent state Υf
physically means the expectation value of the boson number operator with
respect to Υf.
Let pn(f) be the probability of ﬁnding n bosons in the coherent state
Υf. Then, by (5.32), we have
pn(f) = ∥Υ(n)∥2 = ∥f∥2n

In terms of N b, we have, by (5.211),
pn(f) = N b

Spectra of A(f) and A(f)∗
It may be interesting to identify the spectra of A(f)#.
Theorem 5.38. For all f, g ∈H , exp f ∈D(A(g)) and
A(g) exp f = ⟨g, f⟩exp f.
(5.213)
Namely, ⟨g, f⟩∈σp(A(g)) and exp f is an eigenvector of A(g) belonging to
the eigenvalue ⟨g, f⟩.
In particular, if g ̸= 0, then
σ(A(g)) = σp(A(g)) = C.
(5.214)
Proof. The inﬁnite series ∞
n=0 A(g)A(f)∗nΩH /n! absolutely converges
(see (5.119)). Hence, using the closedness of A(g) and CCR with (5.54), we
have
A(g) exp f =


n=0
A(g)A(f)∗nΩH
n!
=
∞

n=1
n ⟨g, f⟩A(f)∗n−1ΩH
n!
.
Hence, (5.213) follows.
For each z ∈C, we have, by (5.213),
A(g) exp(zg/∥g∥2) = z exp(zg/∥g∥2).
Hence, z ∈σp(A(g)). Thus, (5.214) holds.
□
The spectral property (5.214) of the annihilation operator A(g) is
interesting.
In contrast to Theorem 5.38, we have the following theorem on the
spectra of A(f)∗.
Theorem 5.39. For all f ∈H \ {0},
σp(A(f)∗) = ∅,
(5.215)
σ(A(f)∗) = σr(A(f)∗) = C.
(5.216)
17A random variable X is said to obey the Poisson distribution with mean λ ∈R if
the probability of X = n ∈Z+ is given by λne−λ/n!
340
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let Ψ ∈ker A(f)∗. Then, A(f)∗Ψ = 0. Hence, ∥A(f)∗Ψ∥2 = 0.
Hence, by (5.65), ∥A(f)Ψ∥2 = 0 and ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2 = 0. Therefore, Ψ = 0.
Thus, 0 ̸∈σp(A(f)∗).
Next, let z ∈C \ {0} and (A(f)∗−z)Ψ = 0. Then, zΨ (0) = 0 and,
for all n ≥1, Sn(f ⊗Ψ (n−1)) = zΨ (n). Hence, Ψ (0) = 0. This implies that
zΨ (1) = 0. Hence, Ψ (1) = 0. By induction in n, one sees that Ψ (n) = 0 for
all n ≥0, i.e., Ψ = 0. Therefore, z ̸∈σp(A(f)∗) and A(f)∗−z is injective.
Thus, (5.215) holds.
Let z ∈C. Then, by the natural decomposition of Fb(H ) with respect
to A(f) −z∗, we have
Fb(H ) = ker(A(f) −z∗) ⊕Ran(A(f)∗−z).
By Theorem 5.38, dim ker(A(f) −z∗) ≥1. Hence, Ran(A(f)∗−z) ̸=
Fb(H ). Therefore, z ∈σr(A(f)∗). Thus, (5.216) follows.

The Boson Fock Space over a Direct Sum
Hilbert Space
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces. Then, it is natural to consider the boson
Fock space Fb(H ⊕K ) over the direct sum Hilbert space
H ⊕K := {(f, g)|f ∈H , g ∈K }.
This boson Fock space is important not only purely theoretically but also
in applications.
We denote the annihilation operator on Fb(H ) by AH (·).
The following theorem tells us the existence of a natural isomorphism
between Fb(H ⊕K ) and Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ).
Theorem 5.40. Assume that H and K are separable. Then, there exists
a unique unitary operator U : Fb(H ⊕K ) →Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ) which
satisﬁes the following properties (i)–(iii):
(i)
UΩH ⊕K = ΩH ⊗ΩK
(5.217)
(ii)
UFb,ﬁn(H ⊕K ) = Fb,ﬁn(H ) ⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ).
(5.218)
Boson Fock Spaces
341
(iii) For all f ∈H and g ∈K ,
UAH ⊕K (f, g)#U −1 = AH (f)# ⊗I + I ⊗AK (g)#.
(5.219)
Proof. Throughout the proof, we set A(f, g) := AH ⊕K (f, g), (f, g) ∈
H
⊕K . Let {en}∞
n=1 and {ξn}∞
n=1 be the CONSs of H
and K ,
respectively. Then, {(en, 0), (0, ξn)|n ∈N} is a CONS of H ⊕K . By
Proposition 5.1, the set
'
Ci1···in;j1···jmA(ei1, 0)∗· · · A(ein, 0)∗A(0, ξj1)∗· · · A(0, ξjm)∗ΩH ⊕K |
i1 ≤· · · ≤in, j1 ≤· · · ≤jm, ik, jℓ∈N, n, m ∈{0} ∪N
(
is a CONS of Fb(H ⊕K ), where
Ci1···in;j1···jm := ∥A(ei1, 0)∗· · · A(ein, 0)∗A(0, ξj1)∗· · · A(0, ξjm)∗ΩH ⊕K ∥−1.
Similarly,
'
Ci1···in;j1···jmAH (ei1)∗· · · AH (ein)∗ΩH ⊗AK (ξj1)∗· · · AK (ξjm)∗ΩK
| i1 ≤· · · ≤in, j1 ≤· · · ≤jm, ik, jℓ∈N, n, m ∈{0} ∪N
(
is a CONS of Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ). Hence, according to the isomorphism
theorem (Theorem 2.4), there exists a unique unitary operator U : Fb(H ⊕
K ) →Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ) such that, for all m, n ∈{0} ∪N, ik, jℓ∈N,
UA(ei1, 0)∗· · · A(ein, 0)∗A(0, ξj1)∗· · · A(0, ξjm)∗ΩH ⊕K
= AH (ei1)∗· · · AH (ein)∗ΩH ⊗AK (ξj1)∗· · · AK (ξjm)∗ΩK .
In particular, (5.217) holds.

On the other hand, for all f ∈H , g ∈K ,
A(f, g)∗= A(f, 0)∗+ A(0, g)∗
on Fb,ﬁn(H ⊕K ). Hence, Fb,ﬁn(H ⊕K ) is algebraically spanned by
vectors of the form Φ. Thus, (5.218) holds.
To prove (iii), let
Ψ = AH (f1)∗· · · AH (fr)∗ΩH ⊗AK (g1)∗· · · AK (gq)∗ΩK .
(5.220)
Then,
UA(f, g)∗U −1Ψ
= U[A(f, 0) + A(0, g)]∗A(f1, 0)∗· · · A(fr, 0)∗A(0, g1)∗· · · A(0, gq)∗ΩH ⊕K
= UA(f, 0)∗A(f1, 0)∗· · · A(fr, 0)∗A(0, g1)∗· · · A(0, gq)∗ΩH ⊕K
+ UA(0, g)∗A(f1, 0)∗· · · A(fr, 0)∗A(0, g1)∗· · · A(0, gq)∗ΩH ⊕K

Hence, (5.219) with #
=
∗holds on Fb,ﬁn(H )⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ). Since
Fb,ﬁn(X ) (X is a Hilbert space) is a core for AX (f)∗, it follows from
Proposition 3.2(ii) that Fb,ﬁn(H )⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ) is a core for A(f)∗⊗I + I ⊗
A(g)∗. Hence, operator equality (5.219) with # = ∗holds. This implies that
UA(f, g)U −1 = (AH (f)∗⊗I + I ⊗AK (g)∗)∗⊃AH (f) ⊗I + I ⊗AK (g).
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H )⊗Fb,ﬁn(K ),
UA(f, g)U −1Ψ = (AH (f) ⊗I + I ⊗AK (g))Ψ.
Then, in the same way as in the case of UA(f, g)∗U −1, one can conclude
that (5.219) holds for A(f, g)# = A(f, g).
□
We call the isomorphism U in Theorem 5.40 the natural isomorphism
between Fb(H ⊕K ) and Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ) and write
Fb(H ⊕K ) ∼= Fb(H ) ⊗Fb(K ).
Example 5.6. We give an important example of the natural isomorphism
established above, which is useful in applications to quantum ﬁeld theory.
We consider the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)) over L2(Rd) (d ∈N). Let σ
and κ be constants satisfying 0 ≤σ < κ and A := {p ∈Rd | σ ≤|p| ≤κ}.
Then, each element f ∈L2(Rd) has a unique orthogonal decomposition
f = f1 + f2 with f1 ∈L2(A) and f2 ∈L2(Ac) (explicitly, f1 = χAf, f2 =
χAcf). Hence,
L2(Rd) = L2(A) ⊕L2(Ac).
Therefore, by Theorem 5.40,
Fb(L2(Rd)) ∼= Fb(L2(A)) ⊗Fb(L2(Ac)).
(5.221)
Remark 5.22. As is easily seen, isomorphism (5.221) holds for any Borel
set A ∈Bd.
Theorem 5.40 is extended to the case where H ⊕K is replaced by the
direct sum of N Hilbert spaces, with N ≥2 arbitrary, as follows.
Theorem 5.41. Let Hj, j = 1, . . . , N, (N ≥2) be separable Hilbert
spaces. Then, there exists a unique unitary operator UN : Fb(⊕N
j=1Hj) →
⊗N
j=1Fb(Hj) which satisﬁes the following properties (i)–(iii):

The natural isomorphism described in Theorem 5.41 is written as
Fb(⊕N

j=1Fb(Hj).
(5.222)
We next want to see how second quantization operators are transformed
by the unitary operator UN in Theorem 5.41.
Theorem 5.42. Let Hj, j = 1, . . . , N, (N ≥2) be separable Hilbert spaces
and Tj be a densely deﬁned closable operator on Hj. Let UN be the unitary
operator in Theorem 5.41. Then,

Proof. We prove the theorem only in the case of N = 2 (the general
case can be proved in quite the same way). We set U = U2, H1 = H ,
H2 = K , T1 = T and T2 = S. Let Ψ be a vector of the form (5.220), with
fj ∈D(T ), gk ∈D(S). Then,

It follows that, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)),
UdΓb(T ⊕S)U −1Ψ = [dΓb(T ) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(S)]Ψ.
By Theorem 5.1(v), Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓb(T ). Hence, by Pro-
position 3.2(ii), Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)) is a core for dΓb(T ) ⊗I +
I ⊗dΓb(S). We also have UFb,ﬁn(D(T ) ⊕D(S)) = Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))⊗Fb,ﬁn
(D(S)). Hence, (5.223) with N = 2 holds.
□
Example 5.7. In Example 5.6, let F : Rd →R be a Borel measurable
function a.e. ﬁnite. Then, the multiplication operator by the function F on
L2(Rd) is self-adjoint. We denote the multiplication operator by the same
symbol. Let pA be the orthogonal projection onto L2(A). Then, we have
pA = χA, the multiplication operator by the characteristic function of A.
It is easy to see that, for all f ∈D(F), pAf ∈D(F) and FpAf = pAFf.
Hence, F is reduced by L2(A) and hence by L2(Ac). We have F = FA⊕FAc,
with FA = χAF and FAc = χAcF. Therefore, by Theorem 5.42,
dΓb(F) ∼= dΓb(FA) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(FAc)
under the natural isomorphism (5.221).
We next examine the transformation property of Γ-operators under the
natural isomorphism (5.222).
Theorem 5.43. Let Hj, j = 1, . . . , N, (N ≥2) be separable Hilbert spaces
and Tj be a densely deﬁned closable operator on Hj. Let UN be the unitary

Proof. We give a proof only for the case of N = 2. We set U = U2, H =
H1, K = H2, T = T1 and S = T2. Let Ψ be a vector of the form (5.220),
with fj ∈D(T ), gk ∈D(S). Then,
UΓb(T ⊕S)U −1Ψ
= UΓb(T ⊕S)A(f1, 0)∗· · · A(fr, 0)∗A(0, g1)∗· · · A(0, gq)∗ΩH ⊕K

It follows that, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)),
UΓb(T ⊕S)U −1Ψ = [Γb(T ) ⊗Γb(S)]Ψ.
By Theorem 5.6(iv), Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for Γb(T ). Hence, by Proposition
3.2(ii), Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)) is a core for Γb(T ) ⊗Γb(S). We also
have UFb,ﬁn(D(T ) ⊕D(S)) = Fb,ﬁn(D(T ))⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(S)). Hence, (5.224)
with N = 2 holds.
□
Example 5.8. Let H be a separable Hilbert space and M be a closed
subspace of H . Then, H = M ⊕M ⊥. Hence,
Fb(H ) ∼= Fb(M ) ⊗Fb(M ⊥).
Let PM be the orthogonal projection onto M . Then, we have PM = I ⊕0.
Hence,
Γb(PM) ∼= Γb(I) ⊗Γb(0) = I ⊗Q,

Representations of CCR
In this section, we study some representation theoretical aspects underlying
boson Fock spaces.
5.24
Representation of CCR over a Vector Space
As we have seen in Section 5.7, the boson creation and annihilation
operators A(·)# on the boson Fock space Fb(H ) obey CCR, a set of
characteristic commutation relations, and the Fock vacuum ΩH is a cyclic
vector, for {A(f)∗|f ∈D}, with D being a dense subspace of H (Propo-
sition 5.9). Moreover, various operators on the boson Fock space Fb(H )
can be made from A(·)#’s. One of them is the Segal ﬁeld operator ΦS(f)
(f ∈H ), which is a simple linear combination of the creation operator
A(f)∗and the annihilation one A(f), and it has interesting properties.
Boson Fock Spaces
347
Noting these aspects and taking an algebraic point of view, one may
regard the boson Fock space Fb(H ) as a Hilbert space, in which algebraic
objects obeying CCR are realized as A(f)#’s (f ∈H ).
This point of view leads one to introduce a representation theoretical
concept of CCR.
Deﬁnition 5.3. Let F be a Hilbert space and D be a dense subspace in F.
Let V be a dense subspace of a Hilbert space H and C : V →L(F); V ∋
f →C(f) ∈L(F) such that, for all f ∈V , C(f) is densely deﬁned
and closed. The triplet (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) (or (F, D, {C(f), C(f)∗|f ∈
V })) is called a representation of the CCR over V if it has the following
properties:
(C.1) For all f ∈V , D ⊂D(C(f)) ∩D(C(f)∗) and C(f)D ⊂D, C(f)∗
D ⊂D.
(C.2) (anti-linearity in test vectors) For all f, g ∈V and α, β ∈C, C(αf +
βg) = α∗C(f) + β∗C(g) on D.
(C.3) (CCR) For all f, g ∈V ,
[C(f), C(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩H ,
(5.225)
[C(f), C(g)] = 0,
[C(f)∗, C(g)∗] = 0
(5.226)
on D.
The Hilbert space F is called the representation space of the present
representation of the CCR over V .
If {C(f), C(f)∗| f ∈V } is irreducible (resp., reducible), then the
representation (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) is said to be irreducible (resp.,
reducible).
Remark 5.23. Property (C.2) implies the linearity of C(f)∗in f: for all
f, g ∈V and α, β ∈C, C(αf + βg)∗= αC(f)∗+ βC(g)∗on D.
Remark 5.24. The subspace D is not necessarily unique.
Remark 5.25. By Remark 5.15, (5.225) with g = f implies that, for f ̸= 0,
at least one of C(f) and C(f)∗is unbounded. Hence, by Proposition 1.10,
both C(f) and C(f)∗are unbounded.
348
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Example 5.9. The triplet
ρF(V ) := (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {A(f)|f ∈V })
is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V (the irreducibility is due
to Theorem 5.15). This representation is called the Fock representation
of the CCR over V .
Example 5.10. Let L : V →C be a linear functional and
CL(f) := A(f) + L(f)∗.
Then, (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CL(f)|f ∈V }) is an irreducible representation
of the CCR over V .
Example 5.11. Let W : H →H be an isometry (i.e., W is linear and
∥Wf∥= ∥f∥, f ∈H ) such that WV ⊂V and
CW (f) := A(Wf).
Then, (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CW (f)|f ∈V }) is a representation of the CCR
over V . With regard to the irreducibility of this representation, see Prob-
lem 10.
Example 5.12. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the
CCR over V and U : F →F ′ (F ′ is a Hilbert space) be a unitary
operator. Then, (F ′, UD, {UC(f)U −1 | f ∈V }) is a representation of the
CCR over V .
As suggested by Examples 5.10 and 5.11, there are inﬁnitely many
representations of the CCR over V , which are not necessarily of the type
as described in Example 5.12. Thus, we are led toward a concept to classify
the representations of CCR, as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.4. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) and (F ′, D′, {C′(f)|f ∈V })
be two representations of the CCR over V . They are said to be equivalent
if there exists a unitary operator U : F →F ′ such that, for all f ∈V ,
C′(f) = UC(f)U −1 (operator equality). In that case, we often say simply
that {C(f)|f ∈V } is equivalent to {C′(f)|f ∈V }.
Remark 5.26. The operator equality C′(f) = UC(f)U −1 implies that
C′(f)∗= UC(f)∗U −1.

Remark 5.27. Suppose that ρ := (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) is equivalent to
ρ′ := (F ′, D′, {C′(f)|f ∈V }). Then, by Proposition 5.10, ρ is reducible
(resp., irreducible) if and only if ρ′ is reducible (resp., irreducible). Hence,
if ρ is reducible and ρ′ is irreducible, then ρ is inequivalent to ρ′. But this
type of inequivalence is a trivial inequivalence. Non-trivial inequivalences
may occur among irreducible representations.
Example 5.13. Let us consider the representation (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ),
{CW (f)|f ∈V }) in Example 5.11. Suppose that W is unitary. Then, UW :=
Γb(W) is a unitary operator on Fb(H ) and, by Theorem 5.32,
UW A(f)U −1
W = CW (f),
f ∈V .
Hence, (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CW (f)|f ∈V }) is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation ρF(V ).
Deﬁnition
5.5. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f
∈
V }) be a representation of
the CCR over V . Then, a unit vector Ω ∈∩∞
n=1 ∩fj∈V ,j=1,...,n,#=∗,1
D(C(f1)# · · · C(fn)#) satisfying C(f)Ω = 0, ∀f ∈V
(if it exists) is
called a vacuum for the representation. We write this representation as
{F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω}
In the present case, one can deﬁne a subspace
Fﬁn := span {Ω, C(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω|n ∈N, fj ∈V , j = 1, . . . , n},
which is called the subspace generated from the vacuum Ω.
In Deﬁnition 5.5, the condition that Fﬁn = F (the cyclicity of Ω
for {C(f)∗|f ∈V }) is not required. However, if Ω is a cyclic vector for
{C(f)∗|f ∈V }, then we call (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω}) a cyclic repre-
sentation of the CCR over V .
Example 5.14. The Fock representation ρF(V ) (Example 5.9) is a cyclic
representation with the Fock vacuum ΩH .
Lemma 5.23. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over V with a vacuum Ω. Then, for all f, g ∈V , the CCR (5.225) and
(5.226) hold on Fﬁn.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let Φ ∈D and Ψ ∈Fﬁn. Then,
⟨Φ, [C(f), C(g)∗]Ψ⟩= ⟨[C(g), C(f)∗]Φ, Ψ⟩= ⟨⟨g, f⟩Φ, Ψ⟩
= ⟨Φ, ⟨f, g⟩Ψ⟩.
Since D is dense in F, it follows that [C(f), C(g)∗]Ψ = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ. Similarly,
one can prove (5.226) on Fﬁn.
□
Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR over V with
a vacuum Ω. Then, one can deﬁne a linear operator Cﬁn(f) (f ∈V ) on the
Hilbert space Fﬁn as follows:
D(Cﬁn(f)) := Fﬁn,
Cﬁn(f)Ψ := C(f)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fﬁn.
Then, it easy to see that Cﬁn(f) is densely deﬁned and Fﬁn ⊂D(Cﬁn(f)∗),
with Cﬁn(f)∗Ψ = C(f)∗Ψ, Ψ ∈Fﬁn. Hence, Cﬁn(f) is closable. We denote
its closure by CΩ(f)
Lemma 5.23 shows that
πΩ(V ) := {Fﬁn, Fﬁn, {CΩ(f)|f ∈V }, Ω}
is a cyclic representation of the CCR over V .
Theorem 5.44. The representation πΩ(V ) is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation ρF(V ).
Proof. We deﬁne a mapping U : Fﬁn →Fb,ﬁn(V ) by
UΩ := ΩH ,
UC(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω := A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
(fj ∈V , j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N). For any element Ψ in Fﬁn, UΨ is deﬁned by
linear extension (show that this is well deﬁned). It is easy to see that U is
an isometry and Ran(U) = Fb,ﬁn(V ). Since Fﬁn is dense in Fﬁn, by the
extension theorem, U is extended uniquely to a unitary operator from Fﬁn
to Fb(H ). We denote the extension of U by the same symbol U.

Let f ∈V . Then, by CCR and the fact that C(f)Ω = 0, we have
CΩ(f)C(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω =
n

j=1
⟨f, fj⟩C(f1)∗· · ·

⟨f, fj⟩A(f1)∗· · ·
jth
A(fj)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= A(f)A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH .
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(V ), UCΩ(f)U −1Ψ = A(f)Ψ. Recall that Fb,ﬁn(V )
is a core for A(f). Hence, it follows from a limiting argument that
A(f) ⊂UCΩ(f)U −1. Exchanging the roles of A(f) and CΩ(f), we see that
CΩ(f) ⊂U −1A(f)U, i.e., UCΩ(f)U −1 ⊂A(f). Hence, we obtain the opera-
tor equality UCΩ(f)U −1 = A(f). This implies that UCΩ(f)∗U −1 = A(f)∗.
□
Corollary 5.15. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω) be a cyclic representation
of the CCR over V . Suppose that, for all f ∈V , Fﬁn is core for C(f).
Then, {F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }, Ω} is equivalent to the Fock representation
ρF(V ).
Proof. By the cyclicity of Ω, we have Fﬁn = F. Hence, the operator U in
the proof of Theorem 5.44 is a unitary operator from F to Fb(H ) Under
the present assumption, CΩ(f) = C(f), f ∈V . Thus, by Theorem 5.44,
UC(f)#U −1 = A(f)#.

5.25
Second Quantization Associated with
a Representation of CCR
As we have seen in Proposition 5.14 and Theorem 5.18, the operators
dΓb(T ) and A(f)# (f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T ∗)) obey characteristic commutation
relations. It is natural to consider an abstract form of them so that
{dΓb(T ), A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T ∗)} may be regarded as a concrete
realization of a set of abstract commutation relations.
Deﬁnition 5.6. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over V ⊂H and T be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H . A densely
deﬁned closed operator H on F is called a second quantization operator
352
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(or simply a second quantization) of T associated with (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈
V }) if there exists a dense subspace D0 ⊂D such that
[H, C(f)] = −C(T ∗f),
(5.227)
[H, C(f)∗] = C(T f)∗,
f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T ∗)
(5.228)
on D0.18
Remark 5.28. It is obvious that, if H is a second quantization of T
associated with (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }), then so is H +L, for all linear oper-
ators L on F, such that H +L is a densely deﬁned closed operator and, for
all f ∈V and Ψ ∈D0, [L, C(f)#]Ψ = 0. In particular, for all constants c,
H + c is a second quantization of T associated with (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }).
The operator H, up to constant additions, is not necessarily unique (i.e.,
there may be an operator L which satisﬁes the above property and is not
a constant operator).
Example 5.15. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on H .
Then, by Proposition 5.14, dΓb(T ) is a second quantization operator of
T associated with the Fock representation ρF(H ) (the case V = H and
D0 = Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(H )).
We formulate a suﬃcient condition for the existence of a second
quantization operator associated with a representation of CCR. Let
(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR over V and T be a
densely deﬁned closable operator. Let
VT := {f ∈V ∩D(T ) ∩D(T ∗) | T f, T ∗f ∈V }.
Proposition 5.25. Suppose that, for all f ∈VT , D is a core for C(f)
and C(f)∗. Assume that there exist a CONS {en}∞
n=1 of H and a dense
subspace D0 ⊂D satisfying the following conditions:
(H.1) For all n ∈N, en ∈V ∩D(T ∗) and T ∗en ∈V .
(H.2) For all f ∈VT , C(f)D0 ⊂D0 and C(f)∗D0 ⊂D0.

Since D is a core for C(f)∗, it follows that HT Ψ ∈D(C(f)∗∗) = D(C(f))
and (5.227) with H = HT holds. Similarly, one can prove (5.228) with
H = HT .

f ∈V ,
for some g ∈D(T ) ∩D(T ∗). We take Fb,ﬁn(VT ) as D0 (D = Fb,ﬁn(V )). It

(5.229)
is a second quantization of T associated with {CL(f) | f ∈V }.
Note that, if T is self-adjoint, then H(T, g) is a symmetric operator. If
H(T, g) is self-adjoint or essentially self-adjoint, then H(T, g) or its closure
is the Hamiltonian of an abstract van Hove–Miyatake model in quan-
tum ﬁeld theory. We discuss this model in detail in Chapter 13.
Example 5.17. A second quantization of T associated with the represen-
tation (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {CW (f)|f ∈V }) in Example 5.11 is given by
dΓb(WT W −1) (Problem 11).
5.26
Bosonic Diagonalization
In relation to second quantizations associated with the representations of
CCR, we introduce the following notion.
Deﬁnition 5.7. A self-adjoint operator H on a Hilbert space F is said
to be bosonically diagonalizable if H is unitarily equivalent to a boson
second quantization up to a constant addition, i.e., if there exist a self-
adjoint operator T on a Hilbert space H , a real constant E0 and a unitary
transformation U from F to the boson Fock space Fb(H ) such that
UHU −1 = dΓb(T ) + E0.
(5.230)
As seen from (5.230), the analysis of a bosonically diagonalizable oper-
ator can be reduced to that of a boson second quantization operator. For
example, with regard to the spectra of a bosonically diagonalizable opera-
tor H satisfying (5.230), we have σ(H) = σ(dΓb(T )) + E0 and σ#(H) =
σ#(dΓb(T )) + E0 (# =c, d, ess, p).19 Moreover, by the unitary covariance of
functional calculus, for all Borel measurable functions f on R, Uf(H)U −1 =
f(dΓb(T ) + E0). In particular, eitH = U −1eitdΓb(T )UeitE0, ∀t ∈R.
19For a subset D of R and a real constant a, D + a := {x + a|x ∈D} ⊂R.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The following theorem is concerned with the bosonic diagonalization of
a second quantization associated with a representation of CCR.
Theorem 5.45. Let (F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) be a representation of the CCR
over a dense subspace V in a Hilbert space H and T be a self-adjoint
operator on H . Let H be a second quantization of T associated with
(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) and D0 be as in Deﬁnition 5.6. Assume the following:
(i) There exists a unitary transformation U from F to Fb(H ) such that
UC(f)U −1 = A(f),
f ∈VT
(5.231)
and the vector Ω := U −1ΩH
is in D0 ∩D(HC(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗),
n ∈N, fj ∈VT , j = 1, . . . , n.
(ii) VT is a core for T .
Then, H is essentially self-adjoint on U −1Fb,ﬁn(VT ), and for a real con-
stant E(T ), the operator equality
UHU −1 = dΓb(T ) + E(T )
(5.232)
holds, i.e., H is bosonically diagonalizable.
Proof. By (5.231) and (5.54), we have C(f)Ω = 0, f ∈VT . Hence,
HC(f)Ω = 0. By (5.227), the left-hand side is equal to −C(T f)Ω +
C(f)HΩ
=
C(f)HΩ. Hence, C(f)HΩ
=
0, which implies that
A(f)UHΩ = 0. Since VT is dense, it follows from Proposition 5.7 that
UHΩ = E(T )ΩH , for some constant E(T ), which may depend on T .
Hence, HΩ = E(T )Ω · · · (∗). Therefore, Ω is an eigenvector of H. Let
Ψ = C(f1)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω (n ∈N, fj ∈VT , j = 1, . . . , n). Then, by (5.228)
and (∗), we have
HΨ =
n

j=1
C(f1)∗· · · C(T fj)∗· · · C(fn)∗Ω + E(T )Ψ.
Using the fact that UΨ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH ∈Fb,ﬁn(VT ) and (5.59),
we obtain
UHU −1Φ = (dΓb(T ) + E(T ))Φ
(Φ := UΨ).
Recall that dΓb(T ) + E(T ) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(VT ) (see
Theorem 5.1(iv)). Hence, by Proposition 1.33, H is essentially self-adjoint
on U −1Fb,ﬁn(VT ) and (5.232) holds.
□
Boson Fock Spaces
357
We shall see in Chapter 13 that, for a class of (T, g), the second quanti-
zation H(T, g) associated with {CL(f) | f ∈V } (see (5.229)) is bosonically
diagonalizable, whereas for another class of (T, g), H(T, g) is not bosonically
diagonalizable.
5.27
Representation of Heisenberg CCR
The set of operators {φF(f), πF(f) |, f ∈HC} introduced in Section 5.13
suggests a general concept of representations of the Heisenberg CCR over
a real inner product space.
Deﬁnition 5.8. Let K be a real Hilbert space and W be a dense subspace
of K . Let F be a Hilbert space and D be a dense subspace of F. Sup-
pose that, for each f ∈W , there exist symmetric operators φ(f) and π(f)
satisfying the following conditions:
(i) D ⊂∩f∈W D(φ(f)) ∩D(π(f)) and φ(f)D ⊂D, π(f)D ⊂D, f ∈W .
(ii) For all f, g ∈W and a, b ∈R, φ(af + bg) = aφ(f) + bφ(g) and π(af +
bg) = aπ(f) + bπ(g) on D.
(iii) For all f, g ∈W ,
[φ(f), π(g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩,
[φ(f), φ(g)] = 0,
[π(f), π(g)] = 0
on D.
Then, (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is called a representation of the
Heisenberg CCR over W .
Two representations (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f
∈
W }) and (F ′, D′,
{φ′(f), π′(f) | f ∈W }) of the Heisenberg CCR over W are said to be
equivalent if there exists a unitary operator U : F →F ′ such that,
for all f ∈W , Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f) and Uπ(f)U −1 = π′(f).
The representation (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is said to be irre-
ducible (resp., reducible) if {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W } is irreducible (resp.,
reducible).
Remark 5.29. In this deﬁnition, the self-adjointness of φ(f) and π(f) are
not required and the subspace D is not necessarily unique.
Remark 5.30. By Remark 5.15 and Deﬁnition 5.8(iii), if f ̸= 0, then at
least one of φ(f) and π(f) is unbounded.
358
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Remark 5.31. Remark 5.27 also applies to the representations of the
Heisenberg CCR.
Example 5.18. Let φF(f) and πF(f) (f ∈HC) be deﬁned by (5.156)
and W be any dense subspace of H such that CW ⊂W . Then, by Theo-
rem 5.28(iv), (Fb(H ), Fb,0(H ), {φF(f), πF(f) | f ∈WC}) is an irreducible
representation of the Heisenberg CCR over WC. This representation is called
the Fock representation of the Heisenberg CCR over WC.
The following proposition shows that a representation of the CCR over
a complex inner product space with an additional condition yields a repre-
sentation of the Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space.
Proposition 5.26. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and V be a dense
subspace of H . Let J be a conjugation on H such that JV ⊂V . Sup-
pose that there exists a representation (F, D, {C(f) | f ∈V }) of the CCR
over V , and let
φ(f) :=
1
√
2(C(f)∗+ C(f)),
π(f) :=
i
√
2(C(f)∗−C(f)).
Then, (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈VJ}) is a representation of the Heisenberg
CCR over VJ.
Proof. An easy exercise.
□
We call (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈VJ}) the representation of the
Heisenberg CCR induced by (F, D, {C(f) | f ∈V }) with conjuga-
tion J.
Example 5.19. The Fock representation (Fb(H ), Fb,0(H ), {φF(f),
πF(f)
| f
∈
WC}) in Example 5.18 is the representation of the
Heisenberg CCR induced by (Fb(H ), Fb,0(H ), {A(f) | f ∈W }) with
conjugation C.
To consider the converse of Proposition 5.26, we recall a basic concept
in Hilbert space theory. Let K be a real Hilbert space with inner product
⟨, ⟩K . Then, the product space K × K := {(f, g) | f, g ∈K } becomes a
complex vector space with the following operation of addition and scalar
Boson Fock Spaces
359
multiplication: for all (f, g), (f ′, g′) ∈K ×K and α = a+ib ∈C (a, b ∈R),
(f, g) + (f ′, g′) := (f + g, f ′ + g′),
α(f, g) := (af −bg, ag + bf).
This complex vector space is called the complexiﬁcation of K
and
denoted by KC.
Note that ψ := (f, g) = (f, 0) + i(g, 0) (f, g ∈K ). Hence, identifying
(f, 0) with f, we have ψ = f + ig. The vector f (resp., g) is called the real
(resp., imaginary) part of ψ and written as f = Re ψ (resp., g = Im ψ).
A natural inner product is introduced in KC by
⟨f + ig, f ′ + ig′⟩KC := ⟨f, f ′⟩K + ⟨g, g′⟩K −i ⟨g, f ′⟩K + i ⟨f, g′⟩K
(f, f ′, g, g′ ∈K ). Then, the inner product space (KC, ⟨, ⟩KC) becomes a
complex Hilbert space. This Hilbert space is called the complexiﬁcation of
the real Hilbert space K and denoted by the same symbol KC for simplicity.
Henceforth, the subscript KC in ⟨, ⟩KC is omitted, provided that there
would be no danger of confusion.
We deﬁne a mapping CK : KC →KC by
CK (f + ig) := f −ig,
f, g ∈K .
Then, it is easy to see that CK is a conjugation. This conjugation is called
the complex conjugation on KC. It immediately follows that
K = (KC)CK .
Example 5.20. Let H be a complex Hilbert space and C be a conjugation
on H . Then, (HC)C ∼= H .
Proposition 5.27. Let (F, D, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a representation
of the Heisenberg CCR over W as in Deﬁnition 5.8 and WC be the complex-
iﬁcation of W .
(i) Let
Φ(f) := φ(Re f) + π(Im f),
f ∈WC.
(5.233)
Then, Φ(f) is symmetric and, for all f, g ∈WC,
[Φ(f), Φ(g)] = iIm ⟨f, g⟩
(5.234)
on D.

(ii) Let
C(f) :=
1
√
2(Φ(f) + iΦ(if)),
f ∈WC.
Then, C(f) is closable and (F, D, {C(f) | f ∈WC}) is a representation
of the CCR over WC.
Proof. An easy exercise.
□
Propositions 5.26 and 5.27 show that considering a representation of the
Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space W is essentially equivalent
to considering a representation of the CCR over WC.
Remark 5.32. Noting commutation relation (5.234), one can deﬁne a
generalized concept of the representation of a Heisenberg CCR in the
following alternative manner. Let X be a complex Hilbert space and Y be
a dense subspace of X . Let ω be a mapping from Y × Y to R, satisfying
the following (i)–(iii):
(i) (real bi-linearity) For all f, g, h ∈Y and a, b ∈R,
ω(af + bg, h) = a ω(f, h) + b ω(g, h),
ω(h, af + bg) = a ω(h, f) + b ω(h, g).
(ii) (anti-symmetry) For all f, g ∈Y , ω(f, g) = −ω(g, f).
(iii) (non-degeneracy) {f ∈Y |ω(f, g) = 0, g ∈Y } = {0}.
The mapping ω is called a real symplectic form on Y .
Suppose that a set {Φ(f)|f ∈Y } of symmetric (not necessarily self-
adjoint) operators on a Hilbert space F is given and D is a dense sub-
space of F left invariant by each Φ(f), f ∈Y . Then, the quadruple
(F, D, {Φ(f)|f ∈Y }, ω) is called a representation of the generalized
Heisenberg CCR over (Y , ω) if, for all f, g ∈Y and a, b ∈R,
Φ(af + bg) = a Φ(f) + b Φ(g)
on D and
[Φ(f), Φ(g)]Ψ = iω(f, g)Ψ.

Weyl Representations of CCR
5.28.1
Deﬁnition and remarks
The representations of CCR and Heisenberg CCR considered so far
are unbounded in the sense that operators realizing them are unbounded
(see Remark 5.25). However, with regard to Heisenberg CCR, there is a
scheme to translate them into commutation relations of unitary operators
which are heuristically (informally) equivalent but, in reality, not necessar-
ily equivalent.20
Deﬁnition 5.9. Let K be a real Hilbert space, W be a dense subspace
of K
and F be a complex Hilbert space. Suppose that, for each f ∈
W , two self-adjoint operators φ(f) and π(f) on F are deﬁned. The pair
(F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is called a Weyl representation of the CCR
over W on F if the following (i) and (ii) hold:
(i) For all f, g ∈W and t ∈R,
φ(tf) = tφ(f),
π(tf) = tπ(f),
φ(f) + φ(g) ⊂φ(f + g),
π(f) + π(g) ⊂π(f + g).
(ii) (Weyl relations over W ) For all f, g ∈W and t ∈R
eiφ(f)eiπ(g) = e−i⟨f,g⟩eiπ(g)eiφ(f),
(5.236)
eiφ(f)eiφ(g) = eiφ(g)eiφ(f),
(5.237)
eiπ(f)eiπ(g) = eiπ(g)eiπ(f).
(5.238)
The Weyl representation (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f
∈W }) is said to be
irreducible (resp., reducible) if {eiφ(f), eiπ(f) | f ∈W } is irreducible
(resp., reducible).
20For a heuristic argument, see, for example, Putnam (1967), Section 4.2, where the case
of the Heisenberg CCR with one degree of freedom is discussed.
362
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Two Weyl representations (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) and (F ′, {φ′(f),
π′(f) | f ∈W }) are said to be equivalent if there exists a unitary operator
U : F →F ′ such that, for all f ∈W , Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f) and Uπ(f)U −1 =
π′(f).
If dim W = ∞, then (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) is said to be a Weyl
representation with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
Remark 5.33. Relations (5.237) and (5.238) imply that {φ(f) | f ∈W }
(resp., {π(f) | f ∈W }) is a family of strongly commuting self-adjoint oper-
ators on F. Hence, for all f, g, φ(f) + φ(g) is essentially self-adjoint and
φ(f +g) = φ(f) + φ(g). Similarly, we have π(f +g) = π(f) + π(g). It follows
that
eiφ(f+g) = eiφ(f)eiφ(g),
eiπ(f+g) = eiπ(f)eiπ(g).
Remark 5.34. Remark 5.27 also applies to the Weyl representations of
CCR.
Remark 5.35. Deﬁnition 5.9 includes, as a special case, the concept of
Weyl representation of the CCR with N degrees of freedom (N ∈N), which
is deﬁned as follows. Let Qn and Pn (n = 1, . . . , N) be self-adjoint operators
on a Hilbert space F. Then, (F, {Qn, Pn | n = 1, . . . , N}) is called a Weyl
representation of the CCR with N degrees of freedom if it satisﬁes the
following relations (the Weyl relations with N degrees of freedom): for all
s, t ∈R and n, m = 1, . . . , N,
eitQneisPm = e−iδnmtseisPmeitQn,
(5.239)
eitQneisQm = eisQmeitQn,
eitPneisPm = eitPmeisPn.
(5.240)
Indeed, if one takes an ONS {en}N
n=1 with en ∈W in Deﬁnition 5.9 and
deﬁnes Qn := φ(en) and Pn := π(en) (n ∈N), then these operators obey
(5.239) and (5.240).
It is shown that a Weyl representation (F, {Qn, Pn | n = 1, . . . , N})
is a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with N degrees of freedom
(Problem 5 in Chapter 3). For a proof of this fact, see Proposition 5.28
and Theorem 5.48. But the converse is not true. Namely, a representation
of the Heisenberg CCR with ﬁnite degrees of freedom is not necessarily a
Weyl representation. We have seen this in Problem 21 in Chapter 1.
Remark 5.36. As is well known, any irreducible Weyl representation
(F, {Qn, Pn|n = 1, . . . , N}) with N degrees of freedom on a separable
Boson Fock Spaces
363
Hilbert space F is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger representation
π(N)
S
:= (L2(RN), C∞
0 (RN), {qn, pn|n = 1, . . . , N})
of the Heisenberg CCR with N
degrees of freedom, where qn
is
the multiplication operator by the nth coordinate function xn(x
=
(x1, . . . , xN) ∈RN) and
pn := −iDxn,
with Dxn being the generalized partial diﬀerential operator in the variable
xn acting in L2(RN). Namely, there exists a unitary operator U : F →
L2(RN) such that, for all n = 1, . . . , N and t ∈R, UeitQnU −1 = eitqn
and UeitPnU −1 = eitpn, which are equivalent to that, for n = 1, . . . , N,
UQnU −1 = qn and UPnU −1 = pn This is the celebrated von Neumann
uniqueness theorem on the representation of CCRs (von Neumann, 1931)
(cf. also, for example, Putnam, 1967, Sections 4.3 and 4.11; Arai, 2006b,
Chapter 3). It should be noted, however, that, as for the non-Weyl rep-
resentations of Heisenberg CCRs, the uniqueness theorem does not hold
even if the degrees of freedom are ﬁnite. We want to emphasize this aspect
since there are textbooks and literature with the misunderstanding that, for
each N ∈N, every irreducible representation of the Heisenberg CCR with
N degrees of freedom is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger representation π(N)
S
.
Indeed, there is an example, (H , D, {q, p}), of irreducible representations
of the Heisenberg CCR with one degree of freedom in which both q and
p are unbounded self-adjoint operators and which is inequivalent to π(1)
S
(Fuglede, 1967). Physically interesting examples of irreducible representa-
tions of CCRs with two degrees of freedom inequivalent to the Schr¨odinger
representation π(2)
S
appear in gauge quantum mechanics in connection with
the so-called Aharonov–Bohm eﬀect (see Arai, 1998 and references therein).
Remark 5.37. In contrast to the case of Weyl representations with ﬁnite
degrees of freedom, for Weyl representations with inﬁnite degrees of free-
dom, a uniqueness theorem similar to the von Neumann uniqueness theorem
mentioned above does not hold any more. We shall see this in Section 5.29.
5.28.2
A class of irreducible Weyl representations on the
abstract boson Fock space
Theorem 5.46. Let C be a conjugation on a Hilbert space H and D be a
dense subspace in HC. Then, (Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f) | f ∈D} is an irre-
ducible Weyl representation of the CCR over D.
364
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.28(iii).
□
There is a general class of irreducible Weyl representations of CCRs
which contains (Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f) | f ∈D}, as shown in the following.
Let T be an injective self-adjoint operator on H reduced by HC and
D be a dense subspace in HC such that D ⊂D(T ) ∩D(T −1). Then, one
can deﬁne
φT (f) := φF(T −1f),
πT (f) := πF(T f),
f ∈D.
(5.241)
Note that, by the reducibility of T by HC, T −1f, T f ∈HC, for all f ∈D.
Theorem 5.47. Suppose that T −1D and T D are dense in HC. Then,
(Fb(H ), {φT (f), πT (f)|f ∈D}) is an irreducible Weyl representation of
the CCR over D.
Proof. Since
 
T −1f, T g
!
= ⟨f, g⟩for all f, g ∈D, it follows from the Weyl
relations of {eiφF(f), eiπF(f)|f ∈D} that {eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈D} obeys the
Weyl relations over D. To prove the irreducibility of {eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈
D}, let B ∈{eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈D}′. Then, BeiφF(f) = eiφF(f)B · · · (∗) and
BeiπF(g) = eiπF(g)B, for all f ∈T −1D and g ∈T D. Since T −1D is dense in
HC, for any f ∈HC, there exists a sequence {fn}∞
n=1 in T −1D such that
fn →f (n →∞). By (∗), for all Ψ ∈Fb(H ),
BeiφF(fn)Ψ = eiφF(fn)BΨ.
By the strong continuity of ΦS(h) in h ∈H (see Theorem 5.27(iii)), tak-
ing the limit n →∞in the above equation yields BeiφF(f)Ψ = eiφF(f)BΨ,
i.e., BeiφF(f) = eiφF(f)B. Similarly, we have BeiπF(f) = eiπF(f)B, for all
f ∈HC. Hence, B ∈{eiφF(f), eiπF(f)|f ∈HC}′. Therefore, by Theo-
rem 5.28(iii), B = cI for some c ∈C. Thus, {eiφT (f), eiπT (f)|f ∈D} is
irreducible.
□
Remark 5.38. A detailed study on the representation ρT := {eiφT (f),
eiπT (f) |f ∈D} is given in Arai (2016a). In this chapter, a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for two representations ρT1 and ρT2 to be equivalent is
formulated. In particular, it is shown that, if the closure of T −1
2
T1−T2T −1
1
is
not Hilbert–Schmidt with some technical conditions, then they are inequiv-
alent. This is an interesting structure.

General properties
We now turn to the general aspects of the Weyl representations of CCR.
We ﬁrst prove two lemmas, which are important in themselves.
Lemma 5.24. Let H be a self-adjoint operator and T be a closed operator
on a Hilbert space satisfying the operator equality
eitHT e−itH = T + ct,
t ∈R,
(5.242)
where c ∈C is a constant. Then:
(i) D(H) ∩D(HT ) ⊂D(T H) and
[T, H]Ψ = icΨ,
Ψ ∈D(H) ∩D(HT )
(5.243)
(ii) (spectrum of T ) If T is self-adjoint and c ̸= 0, then σ(T ) = R.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(H) ∩D(HT ). Then, we have, for all t ∈R,
T e−itHΨ = e−itHT Ψ + cte−itHΨ.
Since Ψ is in D(H) ∩D(HT ), the right-hand side is strongly diﬀerentiable
in t, and its strong derivative is −ie−itHHT Ψ + ce−itHΨ −icte−itHHΨ.
Hence, the left-hand side is strongly diﬀerentiable in t. This fact and the
closedness of T imply that −ie−itHHΨ ∈D(T ) and d(T e−itHΨ)/dt =
−iT e−itHHΨ. Therefore, taking t = 0, we see that Ψ ∈D(T H) and (5.243)
holds.
(ii) Let T be self-adjoint. Then, it is easy to see that c ∈R \ {0}.
By the unitary invariance of the spectrum of a linear operator, we have
σ(T ) = σ(T + ct) = {λ + ct|λ ∈σ(T )} for all t ∈R. Since σ(T ) ̸= ∅, there
is a λ0 ∈σ(T ). Hence, for all t ∈R, λ0 + ct ∈σ(T ). Therefore, σ(T ) = R.
□
Remark 5.39. If H represents a quantum Hamiltonian, then a (closed)
symmetric operator T satisfying (5.242) with c = 1 is called a strong
time operator with respect to H (Arai, 2005).21
Remark 5.40. Concerning the spectrum of H, one has the following fact:
if H is self-adjoint and T is a symmetric operator satisfying (5.242) with
c ̸= 0, then H is absolutely continuous.22 For a proof of this fact, see Arai
(2005), Theorem 6.7, and Schm¨udgen (1983a), Corollary 2.
21For the physical aspects of the time operator, see, for example, Muga et al. (2008) and
Muga et al. (2009).
22For the deﬁnition of absolute continuity of a self-adjoint operator, see Appendix C.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 5.25. Let Q and P be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space
obeying the Weyl relation
eisQeitP = e−icsteitP eisQ,
s, t ∈R,
where c ∈R \ {0} is a constant. Then,
eitP Qe−itP = Q + ct,
t ∈R.
In particular,
[Q, P] = ic on D(QP) ∩D(PQ).
Moreover,
σ(P) = σ(Q) = R.
(5.244)
Proof. The Weyl relation is equivalent to
eitP eisQe−itP = eicsteisQ,
s, t ∈R.
By the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we have
eis(eitP Qe−itP ) = eis(Q+ct).
Hence, eitP Qe−itP = Q + ct, t ∈R. Hence, the commutation relation of
Q and P follows from an application of Lemma 5.24(i). An application of
Lemma 5.24(ii) yields that σ(Q) = R. Exchanging the role of Q and P, one
has σ(P) = R.
□
Remark 5.41. Suppose that the assumption of Lemma 5.25 holds. Then,
by symmetry between Q and P, we have eitQPe−itQ = P −ct for all
t ∈R. Hence, by Remark 5.40, Q and P are absolutely continuous with
σ(Q) = σac(Q) = R and σ(P) = σac(P) = R. Thus, we see that the Weyl
relations are so strong that they determine the spectral properties of the
operators involved.
In view of Lemma 5.25, relation (5.242) is called the weak Weyl rela-
tion for (H, T ).
Lemma 5.25 immediately yields the following proposition.
Proposition 5.28. Let (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a Weyl representation
of the CCR over W on a Hilbert space F. Then, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W } obeys
the Heisenberg CCR over W in the following sense:
[φ(f), π(g)] = i ⟨f, g⟩
on D([φ(f), π(g)]) ,
(5.245)
[φ(f), φ(g)] = 0
on D([φ(f), φ(g)]),
(5.246)
[π(f), π(g)] = 0
on D([π(f), π(g)]).
(5.247)
Boson Fock Spaces
367
Remark 5.42. The converse of Proposition 5.28 does not hold. Namely, a
representation of the Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space does
not necessarily yield a Weyl representation of the CCR over the same inner
product space.
Let (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a Weyl representation of the CCR
over W on a Hilbert space F. Then, the closure of the operator Φ(f)
(f ∈WC) deﬁned by (5.233) corresponds to the Segal ﬁeld operator in the
Fock representation {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈WC}. It is natural to ask if Φ(f) is
essentially self-adjoint. The answer to this question is aﬃrmative. However,
to prove this, we still need a lemma.
Lemma 5.26. Let A and B be self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space X
satisfying the Weyl relation
eitAeisB = e−itsceisBeitA,
s, t ∈R,
(5.248)
where c ∈R \ {0} is a constant. Then:
(i) There is a dense subspace D0
⊂D(A) ∩D(B) left invariant by
eitA, eitB, A and B for all t ∈R and
[A, B] = ic
on D0.
(ii) The sum A + B is essentially self-adjoint and, for all t ∈R,
eit(A+B) = eit2c/2eitAeitB.
(5.249)
Proof. (i) For each ψ ∈X and f ∈C∞
0 (R2), we deﬁne a vector ψf ∈X by
ψf :=
$
R
f(x, y)eixAeiyBψ dx dy,
where the integral on the right-hand side is taken in the strong Riemann
integral (see Appendix E, Section E.1). Let ρ ∈C∞
0 (R) be such that, ρ ≥0
and
:
R ρ(x)dx = 1 and fn(x, y) := n2ρ(nx)ρ(ny), x, y ∈R, n ∈N. Then,
by change of variable, we have
ψn −ψ =
$
R2 ρ(x)ρ(y)(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψdxdy.
Hence,
∥ψn −ψ∥≤
$
R2 ρ(x)ρ(y)∥(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψ∥dxdy.
368
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It
is
easy
to
see
that
limn→∞∥(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψ∥
=
0
and
ρ(x)ρ(y)∥(eixA/neiyB/n −1)ψ∥≤2ρ(x)ρ(y)∥ψ∥, which is integrable with
respect to dxdy. Hence, according to the Lebesgue dominated convergence
theorem, the right-hand side of the above inequality converges to 0 as
n →∞. Hence, for all ψ ∈X , limn→∞ψfn = ψ. Therefore, the subspace
D0 := span {ψf | f ∈C∞
0 (R2), ψ ∈X }
is dense in X .
Let t ∈R. Then, it is easy to see that eitAψf = ψft ∈D0, where
ft(x, y) := f(x −t, y) (ft ∈C∞
0 (R2)). Hence, eitAD0 ⊂D0 and
lim
t→0
eitAψf −ψf
t
= lim
t→0 ψft−f = −ψ∂xf.
Hence, ψf ∈D(A) and Aψf = iψ∂xf ∈D0. Therefore, AD0 ⊂D0.
Using (5.248), we see that
eitBψf = ψg ∈D0
with g(x, y) := eixtcf(x, y −t) (note that g ∈C∞
0 (R2)). Hence, for all
t ∈R, eitBD0 ⊂D0. In the same way as in the case of A, one can show
that ψf ∈D(B) and Bψf = iψ∂yf + ψcxf ∈D0. Hence, BD0 ⊂D0.
The Heisenberg commutation relation [A, B] = ic on D0 follows from
Lemma 5.25.
(ii) For each t ∈R, we deﬁne a unitary operator U(t) on X by
U(t) := eict2/2eitAeitB.
Using (5.248) one can show that {U(t)}t∈R is a strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group. Hence, by Stone’s theorem, there exists a unique
self-adjoint operator S on X such that U(t) = eitS. Hence,
eitS = eict2/2eitAeitB.
It follows from this equation that D(A)∩D(B) ⊂D(S) and A+B ⊂S.23 By
(i) and the above formula, eitSD0 ⊂D0 and D0 ⊂D(A)∩D(B) ⊂D(S) and
S = A+B on D0. Hence, by a general theorem (e.g., Reed and Simon, 1980,
Theorem VIII.11), A + B is essentially self-adjoint on D0 and S = A + B,
implying (5.249).
□
23For all ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B), eitSψ = eict2/2eitAeitBψ. Consider diﬀerentiating strongly
the both sides at t = 0.
Boson Fock Spaces
369
Remark 5.43. Lemma 5.26 can be extended to the case of N self-adjoint
operators Aj, j = 1, . . . , N (N ≥2) obeying generalized Weyl relations
eitAjeisAk = e−itsajkeisAkeitAj (t, s ∈R, j, k = 1, . . . , N), where ajk’s are
real constants with ajk = −akj, j, k = 1, . . . , N. In this case, one can show
that N
j=1 Aj is essentially self-adjoint (Arai, 2013, Theorem A.6).
Theorem 5.48. Let (F, {φ(f), π(f) | f ∈W }) be a Weyl representation of
the CCR over W on a Hilbert space F. Then:
(i) For each n ∈N and Fn := (f1, . . . , fn, g1, . . . , gn) with fj, gj ∈W \
{0} (j = 1, . . . , n), there exists a dense subspace DFn ⊂F left invariant
by eiφ(fj), eiπ(gj), φ(fj) and π(gj) (j = 1, . . . , n) and, for j, k = 1, . . . , n,
[φ(fj), π(gk)] = i ⟨fj, gk⟩,
[φ(fj), φ(fk)] = 0,
[π(gj), π(gk)] = 0
on DFn.
(ii) For all f ∈WC, the operator Φ(f) deﬁned by (5.233) is essentially
self-adjoint and
eiΦ(f) = ei⟨Re f,Im f⟩/2eiφ(Re f)eiπ(Im f).
(5.250)
Moreover,
eiΦ(f+g) = eiIm ⟨f,g⟩/2eiΦ(f)eiΦ(g), f, g ∈WC.
(5.251)
Proof. (i) As a natural generalization of the subspace D0 in Lemma 5.26,
one deﬁnes
DFn := span {Ψu(Fn)|u ∈C∞
0 (R2n), Ψ ∈F},
with
Ψu :=
$
R2n u(t1, . . . , tn, s1, . . . , sn)eit1φ(f1) · · · eitnφ(fn)
×eis1π(g1) · · · eisnπ(gn)Ψ dt1 · · · dtnds1 · · · dsn.
Then, in the same way as in the case of D0, one can prove the desired
properties (cf. Arai, 2013, Appendix).
(ii) By (5.236), we can apply Lemma 5.26 to the case where A = φ(Re f)
and B = π(Im f) and c = ⟨Re f, Im f⟩. Hence, Φ(f) = φ(Re f) + π(Im f)
is essentially self-adjoint and (5.250) holds. Taking f + g in place of f in
370
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(5.250) and using the strong commutativity of {φ(Re f), φ(Re g)} (resp.,
{π(Im f), π(Im g)}), we have
eiΦ(f+g) = ei⟨Re f+Re g,Im f+Im g⟩/2eiφ(Re f)eiφ(Re g)eiπ(Im f)eiπ(Im g).
By (5.236) again, we have eiφ(Re g)eiπ(Im f) = e−i⟨Re g,Im f⟩eiπ(Im f)eiφ(Re g).
Using these facts and (5.250), we obtain (5.251).
□
Remark
5.44. It is not so diﬃcult to show that (5.251) implies
(5.236)–(5.238). Hence, (5.236)–(5.238) are equivalent to (5.251). From
this point view, one can generalize the concept of Weyl representation
of CCR. Let X be a Hilbert space and Y be a dense subspace of X .
Let {Φ(f) | f ∈Y } be a set of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space
F and ω be a real symplectic form on Y
(see Remark 5.32). Then,
(F, {Φ(f) | f ∈Y }, ω) is called a Weyl representation of the gen-
eralized CCR over (Y , ω) if
eiΦ(f+g) = eiω(f,g)/2eiΦ(f)eiΦ(g),
f, g ∈Y .
5.29
A Class of Representations of CCR
In this section, we construct a class of representations of CCR from the Fock
representation of CCR. To understand the idea behind the construction, we
ﬁrst recall a geometric concept.
5.29.1
Symplectic group on a Hilbert space
Let H be a Hilbert space with conjugation C (see Section 5.13). As a
natural generalization of the standard symplectic form on R2n (n ∈N), we
can deﬁne a mapping ω : (H ⊕H ) × (H ⊕H ) →C by
ω((f, g), (f ′, g′)) := ⟨Cf, g′⟩−⟨Cg, f ′⟩, (f, g), (f ′, g′) ∈H ⊕H .
The following properties of ω are easily proved:
(i) (complex bi-linearity) For all ψ, φ, χ ∈H ⊕H and α, β ∈C,
ω(α ψ + β φ, χ) = α ω(ψ, h) + β ω(φ, χ),
ω(χ, α ψ + β φ) = α ω(χ, ψ) + β ω(χ, φ).
(ii) (anti-symmetry) ω(ψ, φ) = −ω(φ, ψ), ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H .
Boson Fock Spaces
371
(iii) (conjugation covariance) For all ψ, φ
∈
H ⊕H , ω(ψ, φ)∗
=
ω(Cψ, Cφ), where
C(f, g) := (Cf, Cg),
(f, g) ∈H ⊕H .
(iv) (non-degeneracy) Any vector ψ ∈H ⊕H satisfying ω(ψ, φ) = 0 for
all φ ∈H ⊕H is equal to the zero vector 0 in H ⊕H .
We call ω the standard symplectic form on H ⊕H with respect to C.
Note that this depends on C. In what follows, we ﬁx the conjugation C.
Let A be a bounded linear operator on H ⊕H (i.e., A ∈B(H ⊕H )).
Then, for all (f, g) ∈H ⊕H , ∥A(f, g)∥≤∥A∥

∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2. For each
f ∈H , let A(f, 0) := (g1, g2) ∈H ⊕H and A(0, f) := (h1, h2) ∈H ⊕H .
Then, one can deﬁne the linear operators Aij : H →H (i, j = 1, 2) as
follows:
A11f := g1,
A21f := g2,
A12f := h1,
A22f := h2.
Since ∥A(f, 0)∥≤∥A∥∥f∥and ∥A(0, f)∥≤∥A∥∥f∥, it follows that each
Aij is bounded with ∥Aij∥≤∥A∥and A has an operator matrix represen-
tation (cf. Appendix B)
A =

which acts as

Let
J :=

0 I
−I 0

,
where I denotes the identity on H . Then, ω is written as
ω(ψ, φ) = ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩H ⊕H ,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H .
(5.252)
An operator S ∈B(H ⊕H ) is called a symplectic transformation
if it is surjective and preserves the standard symplectic form: for all ψ, φ ∈
H ⊕H , ω(Sψ, Sφ) = ω(ψ, φ).
372
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that a symplectic transformation is injective and hence bijec-
tive. For each T ∈B(H ⊕H ), we deﬁne T ∈B(H ⊕H ) by
T := CT C.
This should not be confused with the closure of T , which is equal to T in
the present case.24
Lemma 5.27. Let S ∈B(H ⊕H ). Then, S is a symplectic transformation
if and only if it is surjective and
S
∗JS = J.
(5.253)
In that case, S−1 also is a symplectic transformation.
Proof. The ﬁrst statement is due to the following equivalent deformations
of equation:
ω(Sψ, Sφ) = ω(ψ, φ) ⇐⇒⟨CSψ, JSφ⟩= ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒
 
SCψ, JSφ
!
= ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒
"
Cψ, S
∗JSφ
#
= ⟨Cψ, Jφ⟩,
ψ, φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒S
∗JSφ = Jφ,
φ ∈H ⊕H
⇐⇒S
∗JS = J.
If S is surjective and (5.253) holds, then S
∗J = JS−1. It is easy to see
(S
∗)−1 = S−1 ∗(note that S
−1 = S−1). Hence, S−1 ∗JS−1 = J. Thus, S−1
is a symplectic transformation.
□
Lemma 5.27 implies that the set
Sp(H ) := {S ∈B(H ⊕H ) | S is symplectic}
= {S ∈B(H ⊕H ) | RanS = H ⊕H
and
S
∗JS = J}
is a group with the operation of operator product. This group is called the
symplectic group on H ⊕H with respect to C.
24To be strict, one should use a diﬀerent symbol for CTC. But it would make things
unnecessarily complicated.
Boson Fock Spaces
373
Let S ∈Sp(H ) and
S =

S11 S12
S21 S22

be the operator matrix representation of S (Sij ∈B(H ), i.j = 1, 2). Then,
(5.253) is equivalent to the following set of operator equations:
S11
∗S22 −S21
∗S12 = I,
(5.254)
S11
∗S21 −S21
∗S11 = 0,
(5.255)
S12
∗S22 −S22
∗S12 = 0.
(5.256)
In view of the conjugation C, the subset
H (C) := {(f, Cf) | f ∈H } ⊂H ⊕H
may be a natural subset. Indeed, C as a mapping on H ⊕H leaves H (C)
invariant bijectively: CH (C) = H (C).
We note the following fact.
Lemma 5.28. Let S ∈Sp(H ). Then, S leaves H (C) invariant if and
only if
S12 = S21,
S22 = S11.
(5.257)
Proof. We have, for all f ∈H ,
S(f, Cf) = (S11f + S12Cf, S21f + S22Cf).
Hence, S(f, Cf) ∈H (C) if and only CS11f + CS12Cf
= S21f +
S22Cf · · · (∗).
Suppose that S(f, Cf) ∈H (C). Then, (∗) holds. Replacing f by if, we
obtain
−CS11f + S12f = S21f −S22Cf.
Hence, it follows that S12f = S21f and CS11f = S22Cf. Therefore, (5.257)
hold. Conversely, assume (5.257). Then, (∗) holds. Hence, S(f, Cf) ∈H (C).
□
374
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Based on Lemma 5.28, it is natural to introduce
SpC(H ) := {S ∈Sp(H ) | SH (C) ⊂H (C)},
a subset of Sp(H ). By Lemma 5.28, any S ∈SpC(H ) is of the form
S =

S2 S1

,
(5.258)
with relations
S∗
1S1 −S∗
2S2 = I, S∗
1S2 −S∗
2S1 = 0.
(5.259)
For each S ∈SpC(H ) given by (5.258), the operator
S′ :=

−S∗
2

∗S1


(5.260)
satisﬁes
S′S = I.
Since S is bijective, it follows that
S−1 = S′.
It may depend on {Sjk|j, k = 1, 2} if S−1 is in SpC(H ). But, using the
operator matrix representation (5.260), we obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 5.29. Let S ∈SpC(H ). Then, S−1 ∈SpC(H ) if and only if
S1S∗
1 −S2S2
∗= I,
S2S1
∗−S1S∗
2 = 0.
(5.261)
Proof. We need only to apply condition (5.259) with (S1, S2) replaced by
(S∗
1, −S2
∗).
□
It follows from the facts proved above that the set
Sp×
C (H ) := {S ∈Sp(H ) | S satisﬁes (5.259) and (5.261)}
forms a subgroup of Sp(H ), satisfying SH (C)
=
H (C), for all
S ∈Sp×
C (H ).
5.29.2
Bogoliubov transformations
Now, we are ready to construct a class of representations of CCR.
Let S ∈SpC(H ) be given by (5.258) and V be a dense subspace of H
such that
CV ⊂V ,
S1V ⊂V ,
S2V ⊂V .
Then, it is easy to see that SjV ⊂V (j = 1, 2).
Boson Fock Spaces
375
Let L : V →C be a linear functional. For all f ∈V , the operator
A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗is densely deﬁned and closable. Hence, one can deﬁne
a densely deﬁned closed operator B(f) on Fb(H ) by
B(f) := A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗+ L(f)∗
(5.262)
It follows that
B(f)∗= (A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗)∗+ L(f) ⊃A(S1f)∗+ A(CS2f) + L(f).
Lemma 5.29. The triplet (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {B(f) | f ∈V }) is a repre-
sentation of the CCR over V .
Proof. The anti-linearity of B(f) ↾Fb,ﬁn(V ) in f is easily seen. It is
easy to see that, for all f ∈V , B(f)#Fb,ﬁn(V ) ⊂Fb,ﬁn(V ) and, for all
Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(V ),
[B(f), B(g)∗]Ψ = [A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗, A(S1g)∗+ A(CS2g)]Ψ
= (⟨S1f, S1g⟩−⟨CS2g, CS2f⟩)Ψ
= ⟨f, (S∗
1S1 −S∗
2S2)g⟩Ψ = ⟨f, g⟩Ψ,
where we have used the ﬁrst equation in (5.259). Similarly, using the second
equation in (5.259), we can show that [B(f), B(g)]Ψ = 0.
□
The correspondence {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →{B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V is called
the Bogoliubov transformation associated with (S, L). We also write it
as (A(·), A(·)∗) →(B(·), B(·)∗).
In particular, the Bogoliubov transformation associated with (I, L)
(S1 = I and S2 = 0) is called the Bogoliubov translation with respect
to the linear functional L. In this case, B(f) takes the form
BL(f) := A(f) + L(f)∗,
f ∈V ,
(5.263)
which appeared in Example 5.10. In this context, L is called the trans-
lation functional. As mentioned in Example 5.10, (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ),
{BL(f)|f ∈V }) is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V .
Remark 5.45. The concept of Bogoliubov transformation can be extended
to the case where {A(f)|f
∈V } is replaced by any representation
(F, D, {C(f)|f ∈V }) of the CCR over V .
376
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is interesting to investigate the conditions for {B(f) | f ∈V } to be
equivalent or inequivalent to {A(f) | f ∈V }. From this point of view, we
introduce the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 5.10. The Bogoliubov transformation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →
{B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V is said to be proper (resp., improper) if{B(f) | f ∈V }
is equivalent (resp., inequivalent) to {A(f) | f ∈V }.
Remark 5.46. In addition to the above classes of Bogoliubov transforma-
tions, there is another class, called non-invertible Bogoliubov transforma-
tions (Arai, 1991a). This class may have physically interesting applications,
but we do not discuss it in this book.
Let
us
consider
the
case
where
the
Bogoliubov transformation
{A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →{B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V is proper. In this case, there exists
a unitary operator U on Fb(H ) such that UB(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V .
Hence, by Theorem 5.45, under suitable conditions, a second quantization
associated with {B(f)|f ∈V } is bosonically diagonalizable. This structure
has been used to bosonically diagonalize a class of Bose ﬁeld Hamiltonians;
the point is to ﬁnd a representation of CCRs which is obtained as a proper
Bogoliubov transformation and whose second quantization is the Bose ﬁeld
Hamiltonian in question (see, for example, Ruijsenaars, 1977, 1978 and
references therein). For recent advances on bosonic diagonalizations, see
Matsuzawa et al. (2021) and references therein.
Remark 5.47. It is known that some improper Bogoliubov transfor-
mations are associated with “characteristic” quantum phenomena (e.g.,
superﬂuidity, Bose–Einstein condensation). In this sense too, improper
Bogoliubov transformations are also interesting. See Arai (2020) for details
on this respect.
We ﬁrst discuss Bogoliubov translations in the following section. As
for general Bogoliubov transformations, however, we give only a partial
analysis.
5.29.3
Analysis of Bogoliubov translations
Theorem 5.49. The Bogoliubov translation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →{BL(f),
BL(f)∗}f∈V is proper if and only if there exists a vector h ∈H such that
L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩H , f ∈V .
Boson Fock Spaces
377
Proof. Suppose that the Bogoliubov translation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →
{BL(f), BL(f)∗}f∈V
is proper. Then, there exists a unitary operator
U on Fb(H ) such that UBL(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V . Hence, letting
Ω := U −1ΩH , we have BL(f)Ω = 0 and ∥Ω∥= 1. These imply that
A(f)Ω = −L(f)∗Ω and there exists an n ∈{0} ∪N such that Ω(n) ̸= 0.
We deﬁne Ψn ∈Fb,0(H ) by Ψ (n)
n
:= Ω(n) and Ψ (m)
n
= 0, m ̸= n and put
ωn := ⟨Ω, Ψn⟩= ∥Ω(n)∥2 ̸= 0. Then,
L(f) = −1
ωn
⟨A(f)Ω, Ψn⟩= −1
ωn
⟨Ω, A(f)∗Ψn⟩.
By the Schwarz inequality and (5.83), we obtain
|L(f)| ≤1
ωn
∥A(f)∗Ψn∥≤Cn∥f∥,
f ∈V ,
with Cn := ∥(Nb + 1)1/2Ψn∥/ωn =

(n + 1)/ωn. Hence, L is bounded.
Since V is dense, it follows from the extension theorem that there exists a
unique ;L ∈H ∗such that ;L(f) = L(f), f ∈V . Therefore, by according
to Riesz’s representation theorem, there exists a unique vector h ∈H
such that ;L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈H . In particular, we have L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩,
f ∈V .
Conversely, suppose that there exists a vector h ∈H such that L(f) =
⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V . Then, by (5.167), we have
ei
√
2 ΦS(ih)A(f)e−i
√
2 ΦS(ih) = BL(f).
Hence, A(f) and BL(f) are unitarily equivalent. Thus, the Bogoliubov
translation (A(·), A(·)∗) →(BL(·), BL(·)∗) is proper.
□
We next examine if {BL(f), BL(f)∗}f∈V induces a Weyl representa-
tion of CCR. Let C be a conjugation on H
and (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ),
{φL(f), πL(f) | f ∈VC}) be the representation of the Heisenberg CCR
induced by {B(f), B(f)∗}f∈V :
φL(f) :=
1
√
2(BL(f)∗+ BL(f)),
(5.264)
πL(f) :=
i
√
2(BL(f)∗−BL(f)).
(5.265)
378
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 5.30. For all f ∈VC, φL(f) (resp., πL(f)) is essentially self-
adjoint on any core Dc of φF(f) (resp., πF(f)) such that Dc ⊂D(A(f)) ∩
D(A(f)∗), and
φL(f) = φF(f) + 1
√
2(L(f) + L(f)∗),
(5.266)
πL(f) = πF(f) +
i
√
2(L(f) −L(f)∗).
(5.267)
Moreover, (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is an irreducible Weyl repre-
sentation of the CCR over VC.
Proof. Let Dc be any core of φF(f) such that Dc ⊂D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗).
By (5.263)–(5.265),
φL(f) = φF(f) + 1
√
2(L(f) + L(f)∗) on Dc.
Since φF(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Dc and (L(f) + L(f)∗)/
√
2 is a
scalar operator, it follows that φL(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Dc and
(5.266) holds. The statement for πL(f) can be similarly proved.
By (5.266) and (5.267), we have
eiφL(f) = eiφF(f)eicL, eiπL(f) = eiπF(f)eidL,
(5.268)
where cL := (L(f) + L(f)∗)/
√
2 and dL := i(L(f) −L(f)∗)/
√
2. These
relations and the Weyl relations of {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈VC} imply that
(Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is a Weyl representation of the CCR
over VC. The irreducibility of this Weyl representation follows from (5.268)
and the irreducibility of {eiφF(f), eiπF(f)|f ∈VC}.
□
Theorem 5.50. The Weyl representation (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f
∈
VC}) is equivalent to the Fock representation (Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈
VC}) if and only if there exists a vector h ∈H
such that L(f) =
⟨h, f⟩H , f ∈V .
Proof. Suppose that (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is equivalent to
(Fb(H ), {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈VC}). Then, there exists a unitary operator
W on Fb(H ) such that, for all f ∈VC, WφL(f)W −1 = φF(f) and
Boson Fock Spaces
379
WπL(f)W −1 = φF(f). By (5.264) and (5.265),
BL(f) =
1
√
2(φL(f) + iπL(f)) ⊂
1
√
2(φL(f) + iπL(f)).
Hence,
WBL(f)W −1 ⊂
1
√
2φF(f) + iπF(f).
Let Θ := WΩH . Then, WBL(f)W −1Θ = L(f)∗Θ. Since ∥Θ∥= 1, there
exists an n ∈{0} ∪N such that Θ(n) ̸= 0. We deﬁne Φn ∈Fb,0(H ) by
Φ(n)
n
= Θ(n) and Φ(m)
n
= 0, m ̸= n. Then, Φn ∈D(φF(f)) ∩D(πF(f)) and
[φF(f) −iπF(f)]Φn/
√
2 = A(f)∗Φn. Hence, L(f) ⟨Θ, Φn⟩= ⟨Θ, A(f)∗Φn⟩.
Hence, L(f) = ⟨Θ, A(f)∗Φn⟩/νn, with νn := ∥Θ(n)∥2 > 0. By the linearity
of L(g) and A(g)∗in g ∈H , this equation extends to all f ∈V . Therefore,
|L(f)| ≤1
νn
∥A(f)∗Φn∥≤

n + 1
νn
∥f∥,
f ∈V .
Thus, according to Riesz’s representation theorem, there exists a vector
h ∈H such that L(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V .
Conversely, suppose that there exists a vector h ∈H such that L(f) =
⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V . Then, by Theorem 5.49, there exists a unitary operator U
on Fb(H ) such that UBL(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V . Hence, for all f ∈VC,
UφL(f)U −1 ⊂φF(f),
UπL(f)U −1 ⊂πF(f).
Taking closures, we obtain
UφL(f)U −1 ⊂φF(f),
UπL(f)U −1 ⊂πF(f).
But UφL(f)U −1 and UπL(f)U −1 are self-adjoint. Hence,
UφL(f)U −1 = φF(f),
UπL(f)U −1 = πF(f).
Thus, (Fb(H ), {φL(f), πL(f)|f ∈VC}) is equivalent to (Fb(H ), {φF(f),
πF(f) |f ∈VC}).
□
Theorem 5.49 (resp., Theorem 5.50) implies the existence of inﬁnitely
many improper irreducible Bogoliubov translations (resp., inﬁnitely many
irreducible Weyl representations inequivalent to the Fock representation).
Here, we give only a simple example in such representations.
380
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Example 5.22. Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator on H and
D be a core for T such that CD ⊂D. Let g ∈H . Then, LT : D →C
deﬁned by
LT(f) := ⟨g, T f⟩,
f ∈D
is a linear functional. It is easy to see that there exists a vector h ∈H
such that LT (f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈D if and only if g ∈D(T ∗) and, in that case,
h = T ∗g. Thus, by Theorem 5.49, we obtain the following fact.
(i) The Bogoliubov translation
{A(f), A(f)∗}f∈D →{BLT (f), BLT (f)∗}f∈D
is proper (resp., improper) if and only if g ∈D(T ∗) (resp., g ̸∈D(T ∗)).
(ii) The Weyl representation (Fb(H ), {φLT (f), πLT (f)|f ∈DC}) is equiv-
alent (resp., inequivalent) to the Fock representation (Fb(H ), {φF(f),
πF(f)|f ∈DC}) if and only if g ∈D(T ∗) (resp., g ̸∈D(T ∗)).
5.29.4
A general case of Bogoliubov transformations
Let us return to the original Bogoliubov transformation (5.262). In this
case, letting CS(f) := B(f) −L(f)∗(f ∈V ), we have
B(f) = CS(f) + L(f)∗,
CS(f) = A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗.
Note that B(·) is a Bogoliubov translation of CS(·) in the extended sense
(Remark 5.45). Hence, it may be enough to consider the Bogoliubov trans-
formation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →{CS(f), CS(f)∗}f∈V .
Before stating a fundamental fact on this Bogoliubov transformation,
we note a lemma.
Lemma 5.31. The operator S1 is injective and S∗
1 is surjective.
Proof. By the ﬁrst equation of (5.259), we have S∗

Bogoliubov transformation {A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V
→{CS(f), CS(f)∗}f∈V is
improper.
Proof. We prove the contraposition. Hence, suppose that the Bogoliubov
transformation under consideration is proper. Then, there exists a unitary
operator U on Fb(H ) such that UCS(f)U −1 = A(f), f ∈V . Let Ω :=
U −1ΩH . Then, CS(f)Ω = 0, i.e., (A(S1f) + A(CS2f)∗)Ω = 0. Hence, for
all Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), ⟨A(S1f)∗Ψ, Ω⟩= −⟨A(CS2f)Ψ, Ω⟩. By the density of V
and Lemma 5.7(iii), this equation is extended to all f ∈H . By Lemma
5.31 and the present assumption on S1, S1 is bijective. Hence, letting K :=
S2S−1
1 , we have, for all f ∈H , ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, Ω⟩= −⟨A(CKf)Ψ, Ω⟩. Taking
Ψ = ΩH , we obtain
"
f, Ω(1)#
= 0,
f ∈H .
Hence, Ω(1) = 0.
We next take any vector in the n-particle space as Ψ with n ≥1. Then,
we have
"
(A(f)∗Ψ)(n+1), Ω(n+1)#
= −
"
(A(CKf)Ψ)(n−1), Ω(n−1)#
,
for all n ≥1 and Ψ ∈⊗n
s H . For each n ≥1, we deﬁne a vector Ωn in the
n-particle space by Ω(n)
n
:= Ω(n) and Ω(m)
n
:= 0, m ̸= n. Then, the above
equation implies that ⟨A(f)∗Ψ, Ωn+1⟩= −⟨A(CKf)Ψ, Ωn−1⟩, for all n ≥1
and Ψ ∈⊗n
s H . Hence,
A(f)Ωn+1 = −A(CKf)∗Ωn−1,
f ∈H .
(5.269)
Since Ω(1) = 0 as we have seen above, Ω1 = 0. Hence, by (5.269) with
n = 2, A(f)Ω3 = 0, for all f ∈H . Hence, by Proposition 5.7, Ω3 = 0.
By repeating this process with (5.269), we can show by induction in n that
Ω2n−1 = 0, for all n ≥1.
As for Ω2n, by (5.269), we ﬁrst have A(f)Ω2 = −cA(CKf)∗ΩH , where
c := Ω(0) ∈C. If c = 0, then A(f)Ω2 = 0. Hence, by Proposition 5.7
again, Ω2 = 0. Then, in the same way as above, we obtain Ω2n = 0 for
all n ≥0. Thus, Ω = 0. But this is a contradiction. Hence, c ̸= 0. There-
fore, ∥A(CKf)∗ΩH ∥2 = ∥A(f)Ω2∥2/|c|2. The left-hand side is equal to
∥CKf∥2 = ∥Kf∥2. Hence, ∥Kf∥2 = ∥A(f)Ω2∥2/|c|2. Let {en}∞

Lemma 5.32. Let S

C (H ). Then, {CS(f), CS(f)∗|f

irreducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V }′. Then, T CS(f)# ⊂CS(f)#T ,
f ∈V . Using (5.261), one can express A(f) in terms of CS(·)#. Namely,
for all f ∈V ,
A(f) = CS(S∗

A(f)∗= CS(S∗

on Fb,0(H ). Hence, for all Φ, Ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), we have
⟨T A(f)Φ, Ψ⟩= ⟨T Φ, A(f)∗Ψ⟩.
Since Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f)∗, it follows that T Φ ∈D((A(f)∗)∗) =
D(A(f)) and A(f)T Φ = T A(f)Φ. Since Fb,0(H ) is a core for A(f), it
follows from a limiting argument that T A(f) ⊂A(f)T . Similarly, one can
show that T A(f)∗⊂A(f)∗T . Hence, T ∈{A(f), A(f)∗|f ∈V }′ = CI.
Therefore, T = cI for some c ∈C. Hence, {CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V }′ = CI.
Thus, {CS(f), CS(f)∗|f ∈V } is irreducible.

With regard to the converse of Theorem 5.51, the following fact is
known.
Theorem 5.52. Let S ∈Sp×
C (H ). Suppose that S2 is Hilbert–Schmidt.
Then, the Bogoliubov transformation
{A(f), A(f)∗}f∈V →{CS(f), CS(f)∗}f∈V
is proper.
We do not prove this theorem here. For proofs of Theorem 5.52, see,
for example, Reed and Simon (1979), Theorems XI.106 and XI.108 and
Hiroshima et al. (2012), Chapter 2.
Remark 5.48. Theorems 5.51 and 5.52 date back to Shale (1962).

AT and TA are Hilbert–Schmidt.

Example 5.23. Let U be a unitary operator on H , and consider the case

CU,θ(f) := A(U(cosh θ)f) + A(CU(sinh θ)f)∗,
f ∈H .
If θ ̸= 0 and dim H = ∞, then U sinh θ is not Hilbert–Schmidt. Thus, by
Theorem 5.51, if θ ̸= 0 and dim H = ∞, then the Bogoliubov transforma-
tion (A(·), A(·)∗) →(CU,θ(·), CU,θ(·)∗) is improper, i.e., the representation

Functional Schr¨odinger Representation of Heisenberg
CCR with Inﬁnite Degrees of Freedom
The conventional quantum mechanics with N degrees of freedom (N ∈N)
as treated in most textbooks is based on the Schr¨odinger representations
π(N)
S
= (L2(RN), C∞
0 (RN), {qn, pn|n = 1, . . . , N})
(N = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
of Heisenberg CCRs (see Remark 5.36). In this section, we show that,
in the case of inﬁnite degrees of freedom too, there exist representa-
tions corresponding to Schr¨odinger representations with ﬁnite degrees of
freedom.
5.30.1
Heuristic arguments
Heuristically, one may infer that a Schr¨odinger representation of the
Heisenberg CCRs with countably inﬁnite degrees of freedom, if it exists,
should be obtained as π(N)
S
with N = ∞. Unfortunately, however, the
Lebesgue measure on R∞does not exist. Hence, L2(R∞) does not make
sense.
An idea to avoid this diﬃculty is to change the representation space
from L2(RN) to L2(RN, dmN) with a ﬁnite measure m on (R, B1) such
384
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
that the countably inﬁnite product measure of m may exist. As we see
in the following, one of such measures m is the Gaussian measure μg on
(R, B1), deﬁned by
μg(B) :=
1
√π
$
B
e−x2dx,
B ∈B1.
One has μg(R) = 1. Hence, μg is a probability measure on (R, B1). The
N-product measure μ(N)
g
:= ⊗Nμg of μg on (RN, BN) takes the form
μ(N)
g
(E) =
1
πN/2
$
E
e−|x|2dx,
E ∈BN.
The measure μ(N)
g
is a probability measure on (RN, BN). Hence,
(RN, BN, μ(N)
g
) is a probability space.
For all f ∈L2(RN), e|x|2/2f ∈L2(RN, dμ(N)
g
). Hence, one can deﬁne a
mapping uN : L2(RN) →L2(R, dμN
g ) by
(uNf)(x) := πN/4e|x|2/2f(x),
f ∈L2(RN),
a.e. x ∈RN.
It is easy to see that uN is unitary. Let
q′
n := uNqnu−1
N ,
p′
n := uNpnu−1
N .
Then,
q′
n = xn,
p′
n = −iDxn + ixn,
(5.270)
where xn is the multiplication operator by xn on L2(RN, dμ(N)
g
). Thus,
π(N)
S
′ := (L2(RN, dμ(N)
g
), C∞
0 (RN), {q′
n, p′
n | n ∈N})
is a representation of the Heisenberg CCR with N degrees of freedom equiv-
alent to the Schr¨odinger representation π(N)
S
. We show in the following that
there exists a version of π(N)
S
′ with N = ∞.

as follows:
φn(ω) :=

ωn;
ωn ̸= ∞
0;
ωn = ∞
.
Let B∞be the Borel ﬁeld generated by the open sets of ˙R∞. The
following theorem is concerned with the existence of a probability measure
on ( ˙R∞, B∞).
Theorem 5.53. There exists a probability measure μ on ( ˙R∞, B∞) such
that, for all N ∈N, nj ∈N (j = 1, . . . , N) with n1 < n2 < · · · < nN and
B ∈BN,
μ({ω ∈˙R∞|(φn1(ω), . . . , φnN (ω)) ∈B}) = μ(N)
g
(B).
Proof. We need only to apply Kolmogorov’s theorem. For the details, see,
for example, Simon (1979), Section 2. A detailed description of the exis-
tence theorems of inﬁnite-dimensional measures is found in Arai (2010),
Appendix D.
□
The probability measure μ in Theorem 5.53 is called the inﬁnite product
measure of μg. Thus, we have a probability space ( ˙R∞, B∞, μ).
In terms of terminology in probability theory, Theorem 5.53 means that
the joint distribution of the random vector (φn1, . . . , φnN ) is given by μN
g .
Hence, for all Borel functions f : RN →C,
$
˙R∞f(φn1(ω), . . . , φnN(ω))dμ(ω) =

By Lemma 5.33(i), for each complex polynomial P(t1, . . . , tN) of N real
variables tj (N ∈N, j = 1, . . . , N), the composite function P(φ1, . . . , φN)
Boson Fock Spaces
387
on ˙R∞is in L2( ˙R∞, dμ). Hence, the set
P0 := {P(φ1, . . . , φN) | N ∈N, P is a complex polynomial
of N real variables}
is a subspace of L2( ˙R∞, dμ).
The Borel ﬁeld B∞may be too large to consider only functions made
from φn, n ∈N. Hence, it would be better to restrict ourselves to a smaller
and a natural Borel ﬁeld. Such a Borel ﬁeld is given by the Borel ﬁeld
generated by {φn|n ∈N} (i.e., the smallest Borel ﬁeld such that all φn are
measurable). We denote it by Σ∞. An advantage of this choice is seen in
the following lemma.
Lemma 5.34. The subspace P0 is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dμ).
Proof. (outline) Let S (RN) be the Schwartz test function space of rapidly
decreasing functions on RN and, for F ∈S (RN),
ˆF(k) :=
1
(2π)N/2
$
RN e−ik·xF(x)dx,
k ∈RN,
be the Fourier transform of F, where k · x := N
j=1 kjxj. By the deﬁnition
of Σ∞, the set {φn|n ∈N} of random variables is full in the probability
space ( ˙R∞, Σ∞, μ), i.e., Σ∞is the smallest Borel ﬁeld such that all phin
are measurable.27 Hence, by a general theory of random variables (see, for
example, Simon, 1974, Lemma I.5),
Aφ := span {F(φ1, . . . , φN) | N ∈N, F ∈S (RN)}
is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dμ). Using the inversion formula

where the integral on the right-hand side is taken in the strong topology
of L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dμ), we see that F(φ1, . . . , φN) is obtained as a limit of a
27A set {fα}α∈A (A is an index set) of random variables on a probability space (M, B, ν)
is said to be full if the Borel ﬁeld B is generated by {fα}α∈A (i.e., B is the smallest
Borel ﬁeld such that all fα are measurable.

Wφ := span {eik1φ1 · · · eikN φN|N ∈N, kj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , N}.
Hence, Wφ is dense in in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dμ). Then, using th expansion eikjφj =

Thus, P0 is dense in L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dμ).

Representation of the Heisenberg CCR with
countable inﬁnite degrees of freedom
In what follows, we set
L2( ˙R∞, dμ) := L2( ˙R∞, Σ∞, dμ).
For each n, we deﬁne a linear operator ˆqn on L2( ˙R∞, dμ) as follows:
D(ˆqn) :=

Ψ ∈L2( ˙R∞, dμ) |
$
˙R∞|φn|2|Ψ|2dμ < ∞

(ˆqnΨ)(ω) := φn(ω)Ψ(ω),
a.e. ω.
It follows that ˆqn is self-adjoint.
For a complex polynomial P(t1, t2, . . .) of a ﬁnite number of real vari-
ables t1, t2, . . ., we deﬁne a function P(φ1, φ2, . . .) on ˙R∞by
P(φ1, φ2, . . .)(ω) := P(φ1(ω), φ2(ω), . . .),
ω ∈˙R∞.
We denote by ∂nP (n ∈N) the partial derivative of P in the nth variable tn.
Note that (∂nP)(φ1, φ2, . . .) ∈P0. Hence, one can deﬁne a linear operator
ˆ∂n on L2( ˙R∞, dμ) as follows:
D(ˆ∂n) := P0,
ˆ∂nP(φ1, φ2, . . .) := (∂nP)(φ1, φ2, . . .), P(φ1, φ2, . . .) ∈D(ˆ∂n).

Lemma 5.35. For all n ∈N, ˆ∂∗

Proof. Let F := P(φ1, φ2, . . .), G := Q(φ1, φ2, . . .) ∈P0. Without loss of
generality, we can assume that, for some N ∈N, P and Q depend on only
at most N real variables. Hence, by integration by parts, we have

By Lemma 5.35, for all n ∈N, the operator
ˆπn := −iˆ∂n + iˆqn
(5.274)
is a symmetric operator. Moreover, we have the following fact.
Lemma 5.36. For all n ∈N, ˆπn is essentially self-adjoint.
Proof. (outline) By a general criterion, we need only to show that
Ran(ˆπn ±i) are dense in L2( ˙R∞, dμ). This is equivalent to [Ran(ˆπn±i)]⊥=

L2( ˙R∞, dμ) = L2(Rx × Xn, dμg ⊗dν(n))

On the other hand, −iDx + ix, which is unitarily equivalent to −iDx on
L2(R) (cf. (5.270) with n = N = 1 ). It follows that −iDx +ix is essentially
self-adjoint on the subspace spanned by complex polynomials of one real
variable. Hence, for ν(n)-a.e. (x1, . . . , xn−1, xn+1, . . .), ;Ψ = 0 as an element
of L2(Rx, dμg). Therefore, Ψ = 0. Thus, [Ran(ˆπn + i)]⊥= {0}. Similarly,
one can show that [Ran(ˆπn −i)]⊥= {0}.

5.30.5
Lp-integrability of φ(f)
To prove the Lp-integrability of φ(f), we recall a basic fact. Let (M, B, ν) be
a probability space and X : M →R∪{±∞} (M ∋m →X(m) ∈R∪{±∞})
be B-measurable and ν-a.e. ﬁnite (such a X is called a random variable on
(M, B)). Then, the characteristic function CX of X is deﬁned by
CX(t) :=
$
M
eitX(m)dν(m),
t ∈R.
(5.280)
The mapping P X : B1 →[0, ∞), deﬁned by
P X(B) := ν({m ∈M|X(m) ∈B}),
B ∈B1,
is called the probability distribution of X. Indeed, it is easy to see that P X
is a probability measure on (R, B1) and
CX(t) =
$
R
eitxdP X(x).
(5.281)
It is well known that P X is uniquely determined by CX.28
28This is proved by using L´evy’s inversion formula. See textbooks on probability theory.
A detailed description on these aspects is found in Arai (2010), Section 1.9.
Boson Fock Spaces
393
If P X is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure
with dP X(x) = ρ(x)dx (ρ is the Radon–Nykod´ym derivative) and CX ∈
L1(R) ∩L2(R), then, by Fourier analysis, one has
ρ(x) = 1

Proof. By (5.279), we have. for all t ∈R. e−t2∥f∥2/4 =

is easy to see that P φ(f) given by (5.283) satisﬁes this equation.29

For an open subset D in Rd (d ∈N), we denote by Cn(D) the set of n
times continuously diﬀerentiable functions on D. In the case of d = 1, for
f ∈Cn(D) and k = 1, . . . , n, we denote the kth derivative of f by f (k).
Lemma 5.40. Let n ∈N. Suppose that CX ∈C2n(I), where I ⊂R is
an open interval containing 0. Then,

:
M |X|2ndν < ∞implies that

M |X|kdν < ∞, for k = 1, 2, . . ., 2n −1.30
Proof. We prove the statement by induction in n. We set C := CX. Sup-
pose that C ∈C2(I). Using the well-known formula for the second deriva-
tive of a twice continuously diﬀerentiable function, we have
−C′′(t) = lim

The function eitX is diﬀerentiable in t ∈I for ν-a.e. m ∈M and
d

Note that |iXeitX| = |X| is integrable and independent of t. Hence, one
can exchange, in (5.280), the order of the integration with respect to ν and
the diﬀerentiation in t to obtain (5.284) with k = 1.
Next, suppose that the statement of the present lemma holds for some n.
Let C ∈C2n+2(I). Let F(t) := C(2n)(t). Then, by the induction hypothesis,
F(t) = i2n

We note that F ∈C2(I). Hence, we can apply to F arguments similar to
those made for C in the case of n = 1. The ﬁniteness of F ′′(0) implies that

Formula (5.284) with k = 2n + 1 can be proved in the same way as in the
case of n = 1 and k = 1.

The point of Lemma 5.40 is that regularities of CX imply the integra-

We now apply Lemma 5.40 to X = φ(f).
Lemma 5.41. For all f ∈H and p > 0,
:
˙R∞|φ(f)|pdμ < ∞.
Proof. Let C(t) :=
 
eitφ(f)!
. Then, by (5.279),
C(t) = e−t2∥f∥2/4.
Hence, C is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable in t. Therefore, by Lemma 5.40, for all
n ∈N,
:
˙R∞|φ(f)|ndμ < ∞.
For any p > 0, there exists an n ∈N such that p ≤n. Then,
$

j1 ≤· · · ≤jn, jk ∈N, k = 1, . . . , n} is a CONS of Fb(HC). More-

Proof. Let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩHC (n ≥0, fj ∈H , j = 1, . . . , n).

Hence, we obtain UφF(f)Ψ = φ(f)UΨ. Therefore, UφF(f)U −1 = φ(f)
on UFb,ﬁn(HC). Since φF(f) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(HC), the
operator equality (5.294) follows.
□
Theorem 5.57 implies the following fact.
Corollary 5.16. Let πF(f) (f ∈H ) be as in (5.156), with C being the
complex conjugation on HC and
π(f) := UπF(f)U −1.
Then, (L2( ˙R∞, dμ), DW, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈H }) is a representation of the
Heisenberg CCR over H .
Let us see what π(f) is like. For each f ∈H , we introduce an operator
Df on L2( ˙R∞, dμ) by
Df :=
√
2UA(f)U −1.
(5.295)
Lemma 5.46. Let f, f1, . . . , fn ∈H , n ∈N. Then, DW ⊂D(Df) and

Proof. We have Df1 =

2UA(f)ΩHC = 0. Let

Thus, (5.296) follows.
Using (5.294) and U −11 = ΩHC, we proceed as follows:

Proof. This follows from (5.297).
□
It follows from (5.298) that
DenΦ = ˆ∂nΦ,
n ∈N, Φ ∈P0.
Hence, Den is the partial diﬀerential operator in the variable ωn. For all
f ∈H and Φ ∈P0, we have by (5.298),
DfΦ =

⟨f, en⟩ˆ∂nΦ.
(5.299)
This means that Df is the directional derivative with the vector f.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proposition 5.32. For all f ∈H
π(f) = −iDf + iφ(f)
on DW.
Proof. We have πF(f) = iφF(f) −
√
2iA(f) on Fb,ﬁn(H ). Hence, the
desired result follows.
□
As a special case of Proposition 5.32, we have
ˆπn = π(en)
on P0,
where ˆπn is deﬁned by (5.274). Hence, the representation (L2( ˙R∞, dμ),
DW, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈H }) includes the representation (L2( ˙R∞, dμ), P0,
{ˆqn, ˆπn|n ∈N}). We also note that φ(f) is a multiplication operator.
Hence, (L2( ˙R∞, dμ), DW, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈H }) may be interpreted as a
representation in a functional form corresponding to the Schr¨odinger rep-
resentations of CCR with ﬁnite degrees of freedom. For this reason, we call
it a functional Schr¨odinger representation of the Heisenberg CCR
over H .
5.31
Concluding Remarks
The theory developed in Section 5.30 is, in fact, a special case of the the-
ory of Gaussian random process over a real Hilbert space. This concept is
deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 5.11. Let H be a separable real Hilbert space and {φH (f)|f ∈
H } be a set of random variables on a probability space (QH , ΣH , μH )
(i.e., φH (f) : QH →R ∪{±∞}, ΣH -measurable and φH (f)(q) is ﬁnite
for μH -a.e. q ∈QH ). The mapping φH : f →φH (f) is called a Gaussian
random process over H if the following (i)–(iii) hold:
(i) (linearity) For all f, g ∈H and a, b ∈R, φH (af + bg) = aφH (f) +
bφH (g), μH -a.e.
(ii) (fullness) {φH (f)|f ∈H } is full.
(iii) (Gaussian)
:
QH eiφH (f)dν = e−∥f∥2/4, f ∈H .
Remark
5.50. Part
(iii)
in
Deﬁnition
5.11
can
be
replaced
by
:
QH eiφH (f)dν = e−λ∥f∥2 (f ∈H ) with λ > 0. However, if we deﬁne a new
random variable ;φH (f) by ;φH (f) := φH (f)/2
√
λ, then
:
QH eiφH (f)dν =
e−∥f∥2/4. Hence, the choice of λ is not essential.
Boson Fock Spaces
405
The content of Section 5.30 shows that, for any separable real Hilbert
space H , there exists a Gaussian random process over H .
The lemmas, propositions and theorems concerning φ(·) in Section 5.30
hold with ( ˙R∞, Σ∞, μ) and φ(·) replaced by (QH , ΣH , μH ) and φH (·),
respectively. In particular, the boson Fock space Fb(HC) is isomorphic
to L2(QH , dμH ) in quite the same way as in the case of L2( ˙R∞, dμ)
(cf. (5.291)). The Hilbert space L2(QH , dμH ) is sometimes called the Q-
space representation of the boson Fock space Fb(HC).
Generally, the integration of a function on an inﬁnite-dimensional space
with respect to an inﬁnite-dimensional measure is called a functional inte-
gration. The integration with respect to the measure μH on QH is a basic
example of functional integration appearing in mathematical quantum ﬁeld
theory.
The natural isomorphism between Fb(HC) and L2(QH , dμH ) is a fun-
damental structure of the boson Fock space Fb(HC). This structure is
shown to be very useful in studying quantum ﬁeld models because, under
the isomorphism, the time-zero ﬁeld φF(f) (f ∈H ) becomes a multiplica-
tion operator by the function φH (f) on QH , and one can use the functional
integration with respect to μH to study functions on QH . For more details,
see, for example, Arai (2010), Ezawa and Arai (2023), Derezi´nski and
G´erard (2013), Glimm and Jaﬀe (1987), L¨orinczi et al. (2020), Hiroshima
and L¨orinczi (2020), and Simon (1974, 1979).

Fermion Fock Spaces
The fundamental aspects of the theory of fermion Fock spaces, which form the
basis for the construction of Fermi ﬁelds, are described.
6.1
Deﬁnitions and Basic Properties
Let K be a complex Hilbert space and, for each p ∈N, ∧p(K ) be the
p-fold anti-symmetric tensor product of K
(see Section 2.9.4). We set
∧0(K ) := C. The inﬁnite direct sum Hilbert space
Ff(K ) =
∞

p=0
∧p(K )
is called the fermion Fock space over K , or the anti-symmetric Fock
space over K . It is obvious that Ff(K ) is a closed subspace of the full
Fock space F(K ) over K .
If K
is ﬁnite dimensional with m = dim K , then, for all p > m,
∧p(K ) = {0} (see Remark 2.13). Hence, Ff(K ) = ⊕m
p=0∧p(K ). Therefore,
Ff(K ) is ﬁnite dimensional with dim Ff(K ) = m
p=0 dim ∧p(K ) = 2m.
Hence, in this case, the analysis of Ff(K ) is reduced to ﬁnite-dimensional
analysis. This is a big diﬀerence from the case of boson Fock spaces.
Based on the fact mentioned in the preceding paragraph, throughout
this chapter, we assume that K is inﬁnite dimensional, unless otherwise
stated.
In the context of concrete quantum ﬁeld models, K represents the state
vector space of a fermion, called the one-particle space of a fermion, or
the one-fermion space, and the Hilbert space ∧p(K ) with p ≥2 is a
closed subspace of Ff(K ) that represents the state vector space consisting
of p identical fermions. For this reason, ∧p(K ) is called the p-particle
space of fermions.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let Ap be the anti-symmetrization operator on the tensor product ⊗pK
(see (2.40)). Then, by Theorem 4.2(vii), the operator
Pf(K ) :=
∞
p=0Ap
on the full Fock space F(K ) over K is the orthogonal projection onto the
fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
The following proposition on the CONSs of Ff(K ) follows from Propo-
sitions 2.12 and 4.2.
Proposition 6.1. Let {ej}∞
j=1 be a CONS of K . Then,
{ΩK } ∪

∪∞
p=1{ei1 ∧· · · ∧eip|i1 < · · · < ip, ij ∈N}

is a CONS of Ff(K ).
Example 6.1. Let (X, Σ, μ) be the measure space that appeared in Section
2.11, and consider the case of K = L2(X, dμ). Let U as
X,p : ∧p(L2(X, dμ)) →
L2
as(Xp, dμp) be the natural isomorphism introduced in Section 2.11.2 (N is
replaced by p). We set L2
as(X0, dμ0) := C and U as
X,0 := 1. Then, by Theorem
4.1(iii), the operator
U as
X := ⊕∞
p=0U as
X,p
is a unitary operator from Ff(L2(X, dμ)) to ⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dμp). We call
this isomorphism the natural isomorphism between Ff(L2(X, dμ)) and
⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dμp) and write
Ff(L2(X, dμ)) ∼= ⊕∞
p=0L2
as(Xp, dμp).
The ﬁnite-particle subspace F0(K ) of the full Fock space F(K ) (see
(4.38)) yields the subspace
∧0(K ) := Pf(K )F0(K ) = ⊕
∞
p=0 ∧p (K ).
This subspace is called the ﬁnite-particle (or fermion) subspace of
Ff(K ). This subspace is dense in Ff(K ).
For a subspace D of K , we deﬁne a subspace ∧ﬁn(D) of Ff(K ) by
∧ﬁn(D) := ⊕
∞
p=0Ap(ˆ⊗
pD).
(6.1)
This subspace is called the ﬁnite-particle (or fermion) subspace
generated by D. Each element of ∧ﬁn(D) is called an elemental
Fermion Fock Spaces
415
ﬁnite-particle vector in Ff(K ). It follows that, if D is dense in K ,
then ∧ﬁn(D) is dense in Ff(K ).
6.2
Fermion Second Quantization Operators
In the same manner as in the case of second quantization operators on
a boson Fock space, one can deﬁne second quantization operators on the
fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K . Then, in the same
way as in the proof of Proposition 5.2, one can show that the operator T (p)
on ⊗pK (see (4.40)) is reduced by ∧p(K ). We denote the reduced part
by T (p)
f
:
T (p)
f
:= T (p)
∧p(K ),
p ≥2.
(6.2)
As a convention, we set T (0)
f
= 0 and T (1)
f
:= T. It follows from Theorem
1.47(iv) that T (p)
f
is closed.
Theorem 6.1. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K .
(i) The second quantization dΓ(T ) on the full Fock space F(K ) is reduced
by the fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
(ii) Let dΓf(T ) be the reduced part of dΓ(T ) to Ff(K ):
dΓf(T ) := dΓ(T )Ff(K ).
Then,
dΓf(T ) = ⊕∞
p=0T (p)
f
.
(iii) dΓf(T ∗) ⊂dΓf(T )∗.
(iv) If D is a core for T, then ∧ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓf(T ).
(v) If T is self-adjoint and D ⊂H is a core for T n with some n ∈N,
then ∧ﬁn(D) is a core for dΓf(T )n.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 5.1.
□
The operator dΓf(T ) is called the fermion second quantization
operator of T .
By (ii) in Theorem 6.1,
dΓf(T )ΩK = 0,
416
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where ΩK is the Fock vacuum in F(K ). Hence,
0 ∈σp(dΓf(T )).
(6.3)
We call the vector ΩK , as an element of Ff(K ), the fermion Fock
vacuum.
6.3
Fermion Γ-Operators
In this section, we consider the reduction of Γ-operators on the full Fock
space F(K ) (see Section 4.9) to the fermion Fock space Ff(K ).
Let H be a complex Hilbert space and S be a densely deﬁned clos-
able operator from H to K . Then, in the same way as in the proof of
Proposition 5.2, one can show that, for all p ≥2,
Ap ⊗p S ⊂(⊗pS)Ap.
Hence, one can deﬁne a linear operator ∧pS from ∧p(H ) to ∧p(K ) as
follows:
D(∧pS) := D(⊗pS) ∩(⊗pH ),
(∧pS)Ψ := (⊗pS)Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(∧p(S)).
Note that, in the case of H = K , ∧p(K ) reduces ⊗pS, and the oper-
ator ∧pS is the reduced part.
For p = 0, 1, we set ∧0S := 1, ∧1S := S.
The symbol ∧p(S) may be used instead of ∧pS: ∧p(S) = ∧pS.
The following lemma is proved in the same way as we proved Lemma 5.2.
Lemma 6.1. Let S be a densely deﬁned closable operator from a complex
Hilbert space H to K and Γ(S) be the Γ-operator from F(H ) to F(K )
deﬁned by (4.51). Then, Pf(K )Γ(S) ⊂Γ(S)Pf(H ).
By this lemma, we can deﬁne a linear operator Γf(S) from Ff(H ) to
Ff(K ) by
D(Γf(S)) := D(Γ(S)) ∩Ff(H ),
Γf(S)Ψ := Γ(S)Ψ,
Ψ ∈D(Γf(S)).
The operator Γf(S) is called the fermion Γ-operator
associated
with S.
Fermion Fock Spaces
417
It follows that
Γf(S) = ⊕∞
p=0 ∧p S.
We have
Γf(S)ΩK = ΩK .
Hence,
1 ∈σp(Γf(S)).
(6.4)
The proof of the following theorem can be obtained in quite the same
manner as that of Theorem 5.6.
Theorem 6.2. Let S be a densely deﬁned closable operator from H to K .
(i) If S is unbounded, then Γf(S) is unbounded.
(ii) Γf(S∗) ⊂Γf(S)∗.
(iii) If S is a contraction operator, then Γf(S) is a contraction operator,
and
Γf(S)∗= Γf(S∗).
(iv) If D is a core for S, then ∧ﬁn(D) is a core for Γf(S).
Theorem 6.3. Let H , K and X be complex Hilbert spaces.
(i) If T is self-adjoint on H , then so is Γf(T ).
(ii) If U : H →K is unitary, then so is Γf(U) : Ff(H ) →Ff(K ), and
Γf(U)−1 = Γf(U −1).
(6.5)
Moreover,
Γf(U) ∧ﬁn (H ) = ∧ﬁn(K ).
(iii) Let S ∈B(H , K ) and T ∈B(K , X ) be contraction operators. Then,
Γf(T )Γf(S) = Γf(T S).
(iv) Let Tn, T, n ∈N be contraction operators from H to K satisfying
s- limn→∞Tn = T . Then,
s- lim
n→∞Γf(Tn) = Γf(T ).
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 5.7.
□
418
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The following theorem gives the relations between the fermion second
quantization operator and the fermion Γ-operator.
Theorem 6.4. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K .
(i) For all t ∈R,
Γf(eitT ) = eitdΓf(T ).
(ii) If T ≥0, then dΓf(T ) ≥0, and for all z ∈C+,
Γf(e−zT ) = e−zdΓf(T ).
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.15.

6.4
Commutation Properties of Fermion Second Quantization
Operators
Proposition 6.2. Let S and T be densely deﬁned closable operators on K
such that D([S, T ]) = D(ST ) ∩D(T S) is dense and [S, T ] is closable. Then,
∧ﬁn(D([S, T ])) ⊂D([dΓf(S), dΓf(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(D([S, T ])),
[dΓf(S), dΓf(T )]Ψ = dΓf([S, T ])Ψ.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.18.
□
The operator
Nf := dΓf(I)
is called the fermion number operator on Ff(K ).
Applying Proposition 6.2 to the case of S = I, we obtain the following
result.
Proposition 6.3. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K . Then,
∧ﬁn(D(T )) ⊂D([Nf, dΓf(T )]) and, for all Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(D(T )),
[Nf, dΓf(T )]Ψ = 0.
With regard to the strong commutativity of dΓf(T ) and dΓf(S) in the
case where T and S are self-adjoint, the following theorem holds.
Theorem 6.5. Let S and T be self-adjoint operators on K . Then, the self-
adjoint operators dΓf(S) and dΓf(T ) strongly commute if and only if S and
T strongly commute.
Fermion Fock Spaces
419
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.19.
□
A simple application of this theorem to the case of S = I gives the
following result.
Corollary 6.1. Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K . Then, Nf and
dΓf(T ) strongly commute.

Spectral Properties of Fermion Second Quantization
Operators
Let T be a self-adjoint operator on K . In this section, we study the spectral
properties of dΓf(T ).1 By Theorems 4.2(iv) and 4.5(i), the analysis of the
spectral properties of dΓf(T ) is essentially reduced to that of the spectral
properties of T (p)
f
, for all p ≥1.
6.5.1
Point spectrum of T (q)
f
For a set {λ1, . . . , λp} ⊂R (λj’s are not necessarily mutually diﬀerent) and
λ ∈R, we deﬁne
nλ1,...,λp(λ) := #{j ∈{1, . . . , p}|λj = λ},
with the number of js such that λj = λ.
For an eigenvalue λ ∈σp(T ), we set
d(λ) := dim ker(T −λ).
Theorem 6.6. Assume that K is separable. Let q ≥2. Then,
σp(T (q)

) =
⎧

⎫
⎬
⎭.
(6.6)
Proof. Let the set on the right-hand side of (6.6) be Σ.
Let λ = q
j=1 λj ∈Σ. Then, there exist a natural number s ≤q and a
set {μ1, · · · , μs} with μ1 < μ2 < · · · < μs such that {λj | j = 1, . . . , q} =
{μ1, . . . , μs} (i.e., μk’s are mutually diﬀerent λj’s). For each k = 1, . . . , s,

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
let nk := nλ1,...,λq(μk). Obviously, one has n1 + · · · + ns = q and
s

k=1
nkμk = λ.
Since nk ≤d(μk) by the condition of Σ, there exists an ONS {ψ(r)
k |r = 1,
. . . , nk} in ker(T −μk). Let
Ψ :=

Then, Ψ ∈D(T (q)
f
) with∥Ψ∥= 1 and T (q)
f
Ψ = λΨ. Hence, λ ∈σp(T (q)
f
).
Thus, Σ ⊂σp(T (q)
f
).
To prove the converse inclusion relation, let λ ∈σp(T (q)
f
) so that there
exists a non-zero vector Φ ∈D(T (q)
f
) satisfying T (q)
f
Φ = λΦ · · · (∗).
Let Hp(T ) be as in (3.56) with A = T . Then, by Theorem 3.14(i),
Hp(T (q)) = ⊗qHp(T ).
Hence,
AqHp(T (q)) = ∧qHp(T ).
Therefore,
Hp(T (q)
f
) = ∧qHp(T ).
(6.7)
Let {ψk}k be a CONS of Hp(T ) consisting of the eigenvectors of T such
that T ψk = λkψk with λk ∈σp(T ). Then, by Proposition 2.12, the set
Eq := {Ψk1,...,kq := ψk1 ∧· · · ∧ψkq|k1 < · · · < kq, }
(6.8)
is a CONS of ∧q(Hp(T )). Hence, by (6.7), Eq is a CONS of Hp(T (q)
f
).
By taking the inner product of (∗) with Ψk1,...,kq, we have
⎛
⎝
q

j=1
λkj −λ

⎠
Ψk1,...,kq, Φ


Since Φ ̸= 0 and {Ψk1,...,kq|k1 < · · · < kq} is a CONS of Hp(T (q)
f
), as shown
above, there exists a set {k1, . . . , kq} such that

Ψk1,...,kq, Φ

̸= 0. Hence,
for such a set {k1, . . . , kq}, λ = q
j=1 λkj. It follows from Proposition 2.11
that nλk1 ,...,λkq (λkj) ≤d(λkj), for all j = 1, . . . , q. Therefore, λ ∈Σ. Thus,
σp(T (q)
f
) ⊂Σ.

Proof. This is proved in quite the same way as in Theorem 6.6.

6.5.3
Spectrum of T (p)
f
and ∧pT
We need some preliminaries. Let
Ep
T := E⊗
T,...,T ,
the spectral measure E⊗
A1,...,AN deﬁned by (3.37) with N = p, Hj = K and
Aj = T (j = 1, . . . , N). Namely, Ep
T is the p-dimensional spectral measure
such that
Ep
T (B1 × · · · × Bp) = ET (B1) ⊗· · · ⊗ET (BN),
Bj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , p.
By (3.45), we have
T (p) =

T (λ1, . . . , λp).
The spectral measure Ep
T is reduced by ∧p(K ). We denote the reduced
part by F p
T :
F p
T (·) := ApEp
T (·) ↾∧p(K ).
By Theorem 1.47(ix), we have

where σd(T ) is the discrete spectrum of T .
For a non-zero vector Ψ ∈∧p(K ), we deﬁne a ﬁnite measure mΨ by
mΨ(B) := ∥ET (p)
f
(B)Ψ∥2,
B ∈B1.
Lemma 6.2. Let K be separable. Then, there exists a CONS {Ψn}∞
n=1 of
∧p(K ) such that
supp mΨn ⊂Θ(p)(T ).
Proof. Let
Hess(T ) := RanET (σess(T )),
Hd(T ) := RanET (σd(T )).
Then, by (1.57), we have
K = Hess(T ) ⊕Hd(T ).
Here, we consider only the case where σess(T ) ̸= ∅and σd(T ) ̸= ∅. The
other cases are easier to treat in a similar manner.
Let {ψk}∞
k=1 be a CONS of Hess(T ) and {φℓ}ℓbe a CONS of Hd(T )
such that T φℓ= κℓφℓ, with κℓ∈σd(T ). Then, by Proposition 2.12, the set
{ψk1 ∧· · ·∧ψkN ∧φℓ1 ∧· · ·∧φℓM |k1 < · · · < kN, ℓ1 < · · · < ℓM, N +M = p}
is a CONS of ∧p(K ).
Let Ψ := ψk1 ∧· · · ∧ψkN ∧φℓ1 ∧· · · ∧φℓM be ﬁxed (k1 < · · · < kN,
ℓ1 < · · · < ℓM, N + M = p). For notational simplicity, we set ηi := ψki,
i = 1, . . . , N, and ηN+k := φℓk, k = 1, . . . , M. We set
B = σess(T ) ∪{κℓk}M

Then,
ET (B)ηj = ηj.

Let (λ1, . . . , λp) ∈Bp. Then, λj ∈σ(T ), j = 1, . . . , p. If λj ∈σd(T ),
then λj = κℓk, for some k ∈{1, . . . , M}. Since Ψ ̸= 0, it follows that
nλ1,...,λp(λj) ≤d(λj). Therefore, (λ1, . . . , λp) ∈JΘ. Thus, Bp ⊂JΘ. Using
(6.10), one can easily see that Ep
T (Bp)Ψ = Ψ. Hence, Ep
T (JΘ)Ψ = Ψ.
Therefore,
ET (p)
f
(Θ(p)(T ))Ψ = ApET (p)(Θ(p)(T ))ApΨ

T (JΘ)Ψ = Ψ.
This implies that supp mΨ ⊂Θ(p)(T ). Since the set
{(k1, . . . , kN, ℓ1, . . . , ℓM)|k1 < · · · < kN, ℓ1 < · · · < ℓM, N + M = p}
is countably inﬁnite, the statement of the lemma follows.

We can now identify the spectrum of T (p)

.
Theorem 6.8. Assume that K is separable. Then, for all p ≥2, σ(T (p)
f

Θ(p)(T ).
Proof. We ﬁrst show that Θ(p)(T ) ⊂σ(T (p)
f
). Let λ = p
j=1 λj ∈Θ(p)(T )
and, for each number ε > 0, Ij,ε := (λj −ε, λj + ε). By Proposi-
tion 1.38, RanET (Ij,ε) ̸= {0}, j = 1, . . . , p. Recall that if λj ∈σess(T ),
then dim RanET (Ij,ε) = ∞(Proposition 1.41(ii)). If λj ∈σd(T ), then
RanET (Ij,ε) = ker(T −λj), for all suﬃciently small ε. Hence, there
exists a constant δ > 0 such that, for all ε ∈(0, δ), Ij,ε ∩Ik,ε = ∅if
λj ̸= λk and RanET (Ij,ε) = ker(T −λj) if λj ∈σd(T ). It follows that,
for all (j, k) satisfying λj ̸= λk, RanET (Ij,ε) ⊥RanET (Ik,ε). Hence, there
exists an ONS {ψj}p
j=1 in K such that ψj ∈RanET (Ij,ε), j = 1, . . . , p,
where the condition “nλ1,...,λp(λj) ≤d(λj) if λj

(Θ(p)(T ))Ψn = Ψn for all n ∈N. Hence, span {Ψn}n ⊂RanET (p)
f
(Θ(p)(T )).
Therefore, RanET (p)

Fermion Annihilation and Creation Operators
As in the case of boson Fock spaces, one has, in a natural way, restrictions
of the annihilation and creation operators on the full Fock space Ff(K )
to the fermion Fock space Ff(K ) and is led to deﬁne an operator B(u)
(u ∈K ) on Ff(K ) as follows:

where Ap is the anti-symmetrization operator on ⊗pK
and cp,+(u) is
deﬁned by (4.66), with H

and n = p. By an application of
Theorem 4.4, B(u) is a densely deﬁned closed operator. It follows that
B(u)ΩK = 0,
u ∈K .
(6.13)
The explicit form of the adjoint B(u)∗is given in the following
proposition.

(6.15)
(B(u)∗Ψ)(p) = √pAp(u ⊗Ψ (p−1)),
p ≥1, Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗).
(6.16)
Proof. For all p ≥1, Bp(u) := √pAp−1cp−1,+(u)∗Ap is a bounded operator
from ∧pK to ∧p−1K . Hence, Bp(u)∗= √pApcp−1,+(u)Ap−1. In quite the
same way as in the proof of Theorem 4.4(ii) (see also Remark 4.3), one
can show that Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗) if and only ∞
p=1 ∥Bp(u)∗Ψ (p−1)∥2 < ∞
and, in that case, (B(u)∗Ψ)(p) = Bp(u)∗Ψ (p−1), p ≥1. On the other hand,
Bp(u)∗Ψ (p−1) = √pAp(u ⊗Ψ (p−1)). Thus, the desired result follows.
□
Remark 6.1. One can ﬁrst deﬁne B(u)∗by (6.14)–(6.16) and then B(u)
by its adjoint. This may simplify the proof.
The operators B(u) and B(u)∗are called the fermion annihila-
tion operator and the fermion creation operator with test vector u,
respectively.
For a special class of vectors in Ff(K ), one can ﬁnd an explicit form
of operation of B(u), as follows.
Proposition 6.5. Let p ∈N and ψj ∈K , j = 1, . . . , p. Let Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(K )
be of the form Ψ (p) := Ap(⊗p
j=1ψj) and Ψ (q) = 0, for q ̸= p. Then,
(B(u)Ψ)(q) = 0, for q ̸= p −1, and

ψj (in the case of p = 1, Ap−1(· · · ) := 1).

(6.18)
Proof. We need only to apply (6.16) repeatedly.
□
It follows from Proposition 6.6 that, for every subspace D ⊂K ,
∧ﬁn(D) = span {ΩK , B(u1)∗· · · B(up)∗ΩK |p ≥1, uj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , p}.
(6.19)
Moreover, we have the following fact:
Theorem 6.11. Let {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of K . Then,
{ΩK , B(ei1)∗· · · B(eip)∗ΩK | p ≥1, i1 < · · · < ip, ij ∈N, j = 1, . . . , p}
is a CONS of Ff(K ).
Proof. This follows from (6.18) and Proposition 6.1.
□
Henceforth, for each u ∈K , we denote by B(u)# either B(u) or B(u)∗.
The action of dΓf(T ) on elemental ﬁnite particle vectors is given as
follows.
Proposition 6.7. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K and
u1, . . . , un ∈D(T ) (n ∈N). Then, Ψ := B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK ∈D(dΓf(T ))

Example 6.2. We consider the case where K = L2(X, dμ) (Example 5.2).
For notational simplicity, we use the natural identiﬁcation of Ψ (p) ∈

X,pΨ (p) ∈L2
as(Xp, dμp) (see Section 2.11.2) and of
B(u)# with U as
X B(u)#(U as

Ψ ∈D(B(u)∗), Φ ∈Ff(L2(X, dμ)). Then, using (6.16) and Ap+1Φ(p+1) =

As for the creation operator B(u)∗, by (6.16), one can show that, for all

(B(u)∗Ψ)(p)(x1, . . . , xp) =

(−1)j−1u(xj)Ψ (p−1)(x1, . . . , ˆxj, . . . , xp).

Theorem 6.12. Assume that K be separable. Let T be a non-negative self-
adjoint operator on K and {en}∞

Canonical Anti-Commutation Relations
For two linear operators A and B acting in a Hilbert space X , one can
deﬁne a linear operator {A, B} on X by
{A, B} := AB + BA.
By the deﬁnition of the sum of two linear operators, D({A, B}) = D(AB)∩
D(BA). The operator {A, B} is called the anti-commutator of A and B.
430
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 6.13. For every u ∈K , B(u) and B(u)∗are everywhere deﬁned
bounded operator on Ff(K ), with
∥B(u)∥= ∥B(u)∗∥= ∥u∥.
(6.21)
Moreover, the following anti-commutation relations hold:
{B(u), B(v)∗} = ⟨u, v⟩,
(6.22)
{B(u), B(v)} = 0,
{B(u)∗, B(v)∗} = 0,
u, v ∈K .
(6.23)
Proof. Let p ∈N be ﬁxed arbitrarily and Ψp ∈Ff(K ) be a vector of the
following form:
Ψ (p)
p
= Ap(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψp),
Ψ (q)
p
= 0,
q ̸= p,
where ψj ∈K , j = 1, . . . , p. Then,
(B(u)B(v)∗Ψp)(p) = ⟨u, v⟩Ψ (p)
p
−
p

j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨u, ψj⟩
× Ap(v ⊗ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψj−1 ⊗ψj+1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψp),
(B(u)B(v)∗Ψp)(q) = 0,
q ̸= p,
(B(v)∗B(u)Ψp)(p) =
p

j=1
(−1)j−1 ⟨u, ψj⟩
× Ap(v ⊗ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψj−1 ⊗ψj+1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψp),
(B(v)∗B(u)Ψp)(q) = 0,
q ̸= p.
Hence, {B(u), B(v)∗}Ψp = ⟨u, v⟩Ψp.
Using (6.13), one can easily show that
{B(u), B(v)∗}ΩK = ⟨u, v⟩ΩK .
Therefore, it follows that
{B(u), B(v)∗}Ψ = ⟨u, v⟩Ψ, Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(K ).
(6.24)
Fermion Fock Spaces
431
Hence,
⟨B(u)∗Ψ, B(v)∗Ψ⟩+ ⟨B(v)Ψ, B(u)Ψ⟩= ⟨u, v⟩∥Ψ∥2.
In particular, taking u = v, we obtain
∥B(u)∗Ψ∥+ ∥B(u)Ψ∥2 = ∥u∥2∥Ψ∥2.
(6.25)
Hence, ∥B(u)Ψ∥≤∥u∥∥Ψ∥, ∥B(u)∗Ψ∥≤∥u∥∥Ψ∥. This shows that
B(u)0 := B(u) ↾∧ﬁn(K ) and (B(u)∗)0 := B(u)∗↾∧ﬁn(K ) are bounded
with ∥B(u)0∥≤∥u∥, ∥(B(u)∗)0∥≤∥u∥. Since B(u) and B(u)∗are
closed and ∧ﬁn(K ) is dense in Ff(K ), it follows that B(u) and B(u)∗are
bounded with D(B(u)) = D(B(u)∗) = Ff(K ) and ∥B(u)#∥≤∥u∥· · ·(∗).
Taking Ψ = ΩK in (6.25) and using (6.13), we have ∥B(u)∗ΩK ∥= ∥u∥.
Hence, ∥B(u)∗∥≥∥u∥. By this fact and (∗), we have ∥B(u)∗∥= ∥u∥.
Thus, we obtain (6.21) (recall that, in general, for all B ∈B(H , K ),
∥B∗∥= ∥B∥).
By the boundedness of B(u) and B(u)∗just shown and the density
of ∧ﬁn(K ) in Ff(K ), (6.24) extends to all Ψ ∈Ff(K ). Thus, operator
equality (6.22) holds. Similarly, one can prove (6.23).
□
Anti-commutation relations (6.22) and (6.23) are called the canonical
anti-commutation relations (CAR) over K .
Putting u = v in (6.23), we have
B(u)2 = 0,
B(u)∗2 = 0,
u ∈K .
(6.26)
Hence, B(u) and B(u)∗are nilpotent operators.
As a corollary to Theorem 6.13, one can obtain the following important
formula on the operation of B(u).
Corollary 6.2. Let n ∈N and u, u1, . . . , un ∈K . Then,

+ (−1)B(u1)∗B(u)B(u2)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK .
Iterating this repeatedly and using (6.13), we obtain (6.27).
□
6.8
Spectra of B(u)#
Let us identify the spectra of B(u)#. This is done by noting (6.26) and the
following lemma.
Lemma 6.3. Let A be an everywhere deﬁned bounded linear operator on a
Hilbert space H such that A2 = 0. Then, σ(A) = σp(A) = {0}. Moreover,
dim kerA ≥dim Ran(A).
Proof. The case A = 0 is trivial. Hence, we consider the case A ̸= 0. Let
λ ∈σp(A). Then, there is a non-zero vector ψ ∈H such that Aψ = λψ.
By A2 = 0, 0 = λAψ = λ2ψ. Hence, λ = 0. Therefore, σp(A) ⊂{0}.
Since A ̸= 0, there is a non-zero vector φ ∈H such that Aφ ̸= 0. We
have A(Aφ) = 0. Hence, Aφ is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue 0. Thus,
σp(A) = {0}. The proof just derived shows that ker A ⊃RanA. Hence,
dim kerA ≥dim RanA.
To prove σ(A) = {0}, it is suﬃcient to show that C \ {0} ⊂ρ(A) · · · (∗).
Let z ∈C \ {0} and ψ ∈ker(A −z). Then, (A −z)ψ = 0 · · · (∗∗). Hence,
A(A −z)ψ = 0, which implies that zAψ = 0, and hence Aψ = 0. There-
fore, by (∗∗) again, zψ = 0, and hence ψ = 0. Therefore, ker(A −z) = {0},
implying that A−z is injective. To show that A−z is surjective, let φ ∈H
and deﬁne η := −(A + z)φ/z2. Then, it is easy to see that (A −z)η = φ.
Hence, A−z is surjective. Thus, A−z is bijective, and z ∈ρ(A). Therefore,
(∗) holds.
□
Theorem 6.14. For all u ∈K ,
σ(B(u)#) = σp(B(u)#) = {0}.
(6.28)
If K is inﬁnite dimensional, then the multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 of B(u)#
is inﬁnite.
Fermion Fock Spaces
433
Proof. One can apply Lemma 6.3 to the case A = B(u)# to conclude
(6.28). If K is inﬁnite dimensional, then {u}⊥is inﬁnite dimensional. Using
the CAR of B(·)# and (6.13), one can easily show that, for all n ∈N and
u1, . . . , un ∈{u}⊥,
B(u1)∗· · ·B(un)∗ΩK ∈ker B(u), B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗B(u)∗ΩK ∈ker B(u)∗.
Hence, dim ker B(u)# = ∞.
□
Another proof of Theorem 6.14 with a more detailed structural analysis
is given in Example 6.3.
6.9
Characterization of the Fermion Fock Vacuum
As we have seen, for all u ∈K , B(u) vanishes the fermion Fock vacuum
ΩK (see (6.13)). In fact, the converse is true.
Theorem 6.15. Let D be a dense subspace of K and Ψ ∈Ff(K ) be a
vector such that, for all u ∈D, B(u)Ψ = 0. Then, there exists a constant
α ∈C such that Ψ = αΩK .
Proof. For all Φ ∈Ff(K ), we have
0 = ⟨Φ, B(u)Ψ⟩= ⟨B(u)∗Φ, Ψ⟩.
Let Φ ∈∧p(K ) (p ≥0). Then,
√p + 1Ap+1(u ⊗Φ), Ψ (p+1)
= 0. The
subspace algebraically spanned by {Ap+1(u ⊗Φ)|u ∈D, Φ ∈∧p(K )} is
dense in ∧p+1(K ). Hence, Ψ (p+1) = 0. Since p ≥0 is arbitrary, it follows
that Ψ = {Ψ (0), 0, 0, . . .} = αΩK with α := Ψ (0).

Occupation Number Representation for a System

Relations Between the Fermion Second Quantization
Operators and the Fermion Annihilation–Creation
Operators
Theorem 6.16. Let T be a densely deﬁned closable operator on K .
(i) For every u ∈D(T ), B(u)∗leaves D(dΓf(T )) invariant and
[dΓf(T ), B(u)∗] = B(T u)∗
on D(dΓf(T )).
(6.31)
Fermion Fock Spaces
435
(ii) For every u ∈D(T ∗), B(u) leaves dΓf(T ) invariant and
[dΓf(T ), B(u)] = −B(T ∗u)
on D(dΓf(T )).
(6.32)
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈∧ﬁn(D(T )). Then, by Proposition 6.7, Ψ, B(u)∗Ψ ∈
D(dΓf(T )) (u ∈D(T )) and
dΓf(T )B(u)∗Ψ = B(T u)∗Ψ + B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψ.
Hence, [dΓf(T ), B(u)∗]Ψ = B(T u)∗Ψ.
Let Ψ
∈D(dΓf(T )). Since ∧ﬁn(D(T )) is a core for dΓf(T ), there
exists a sequence {Ψn}n in ∧ﬁn(D(T )) such that Ψn →Ψ, dΓf(T )Ψn →
dΓf(T )Ψ (n →∞). By the result obtained above, we have
dΓf(T )B(u)∗Ψn = B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψn + B(T u)∗Ψn.
By the boundedness of B(·)∗, the right-hand side of this equation converges
to B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψ+B(T u)∗Ψ as n →∞. Hence, by the closedness of dΓf(T ),
B(u)∗Ψ ∈D(dΓf(T )) and dΓf(T )B(u)∗Ψ = B(u)∗dΓf(T )Ψ + B(T u)∗Ψ.
Thus, B(u)∗leaves D(dΓf(T )) invariant and (6.31) holds on D(dΓf(T )).
(ii) Let u ∈D(T ∗). Then, by considering the adjoint of (6.31) with T
replaced by T ∗, we have
[dΓf(T ), B(u)] = −B(T ∗u)
on ∧ﬁn(D(T )).
Then, by a limiting argument similar to that in (i), one can see that B(u)
leaves D(dΓf(T )) invariant, and (6.32) holds.
□
Theorem 6.17. Let W be a unitary operator on K . Then,
Γf(W)B(u)#Γf(W)−1 = B(Wu)#,
u ∈K .
(6.33)
Proof. Let Ψ
=
B(u1)∗· · · B(un)∗ΩK
(n
≥
0, uj
∈
K , j
=
1, . . . , n). Then, it is easy to see that Γf(W)B(u)∗Ψ = B(Wu)∗Γf(W)Ψ.
Since the subspace algebraically spanned by vectors of the form Ψ is
dense in Ff(K ) and Γf(W) and B(u)∗are bounded, it follows that
Γf(W)B(u)∗= B(Wu)∗Γf(W). Hence, (6.33) with B(u)# = B(u)∗holds.
Similarly (or by taking the adjoint of (6.33) with B(u)# = B(u)∗),
we obtain (6.33) with B(u)# = B(u).
□
By this theorem and Theorem 6.4(i), we obtain the following theorem.

We introduce a bounded self-adjoint operator (−1)Nf on Ff(K ) by

Ψ ∈Ff(K ), p ≥0.
(6.34)
Using functional calculus, we have
(−1)Nf = eiπNf = e−iπNf.
Corollary 6.3 is rephrased as the anti-commutativity of (−1)Nf and B(u)#:
{(−1)Nf, B(u)#} = 0.

Uniform Diﬀerentiability of Operator-Valued
Functions
For a self-adjoint operator T on K and a vector u ∈K , one has bounded
operator-valued functions B(eitT u) and B(eitT u)∗of t ∈R. In this section,
we consider their diﬀerentiability.
To state a theorem on this aspect, we recall the deﬁnition of diﬀeren-
tiability of an operator-valued function on an interval I of R. Let H be
a Hilbert space and t0 ∈I. Then, the operator-valued function T : I →
B(H ); I ∋t →T (t) ∈B(H ) is said to be uniformly diﬀerentiable at
t = t0 if the uniform limit u- limt→t0(T (t) −T (t0))/(t −t0) ∈B(H ) exists.
If T is uniformly diﬀerentiable at any point t in I, then T is said to be
uniformly diﬀerentiable on I. In this case, we deﬁne
dT (t)
dt
:= u- lim
ε→0
T (t + ε) −T (t)
ε
∈B(H )
and call it the uniform derivative of T .
If dT/dt is uniformly diﬀerentiable on I, then T is said to be twice
uniformly diﬀerentiable on I. In this case, the second uniform derivative is
deﬁned by
d2T (t)
dt2
:= dT ′(t)
dt
,
T ′(t) := dT (t)
dt
.
In a similar manner, for any natural number n ≥3, one can deﬁne n times
uniform diﬀerentiability of T and the nth uniform derivative T (n)(t) =
dnT (t)/dtn inductively:
dnT (t)
dtn
:= dT (n−1)(t)
dt
.
Theorem 6.20. Let u ∈D(T n) and n ∈N. Then, B(eitT u)# is n times
uniformly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R with uniform derivative
dnB(eitT u)#
dtn
= B(ineitT T nu)#.
438
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case of n = 1. Let t ∈R, ε ∈R\{0}, u ∈D(T )
and
Aε := B(ei(t+ε)T u)# −B(eitT u)#
ε
−B(ieitT T u)#.
Then, we have Aε = B(eitT uε)#, with
uε := eiεT u −u
ε
−iT u.
Hence, ∥Aε∥= ∥eitT uε∥= ∥uε∥. By Theorem 1.29(iii), limε→∥uε∥= 0.
Thus, the current theorem with n = 1 holds. Similarly, by induction in n,
one can prove the theorem with any n.

The Fermion Fock Space over a Direct Sum
Hilbert Space
Let K1 and K2 be complex Hilbert spaces. Then, one can consider the
fermion Fock space Ff(K1⊕K2) over the direct sum Hilbert space K1⊕K2.
As in the boson Fock space case, there exists a natural isomorphism between
Ff(K1 ⊕K2) and Ff(K1) ⊗Ff(K2) if K1 and K2 are separable. To be
deﬁnite, for i = 1, 2, we denote by BKi(u) the annihilation operator on
Ff(Ki) with test vector u ∈Ki. On the other hand, we simply denote by
B(u, v) the annihilation operator on Ff(K1 ⊕K2) with test vector (u, v) ∈
K1 ⊕K2.
In what follows, we use the convention that, for algebraic objects Xi
(i ∈N), X1 · · · Xp := 1 if p = 0.
Theorem 6.21. Suppose that K1 and K2 are separable. Then, there exists
a unique unitary operator U : Ff(K1 ⊕K2) →Ff(K1)⊗Ff(K2) such that
UΩK1⊕K2 = ΩK1 ⊗ΩK2
(6.40)
and, for all n, m ∈N and ui ∈K1, vj ∈K2 (i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m),
UB(u1, 0)∗· · · B(un, 0)∗B(0, v1)∗· · · B(0, vm)∗ΩK1⊕K2
(6.41)
= BK1(u1)∗· · · BK1(un)∗ΩK1 ⊗BK2(v1)∗· · · BK2(vm)∗ΩK2. (6.42)
Fermion Fock Spaces
439
Moreover, the following hold:
(i) For all u ∈K1, v ∈K2,
UB(u, v)#U −1 = BK1(u)# ⊗I + (−1)Nf ⊗BK2(v)#.
(6.43)
(ii) Let T1 and T2 be densely deﬁned closable operators on K1 and K2,
respectively. Then,
UdΓf(T1 ⊕T2)U −1 = dΓf(T1) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(T2).
(iii) Let A1 and A2 be contraction operators on K1 and K2, respectively.
Then,
UΓ(A1 ⊕A2)U −1 = Γ(A1) ⊗Γ(A2).
Proof. Let {en}∞
n=1 and {fn}∞
n=1 be the CONSs of K1 and K2, respec-
tively. Then, by Theorem 6.11,
{B(ei1)∗· · · B(eip)∗ΩK1 ⊗B(fj1)∗· · · B(fjq)∗ΩK2| p, q ≥0, i1 < · · · < ip,
j1 < · · · < jq, ik, jℓ∈N, k = 1, . . . , p, ℓ= 1, . . . , q}
is a CONS of Ff(K1)⊗Ff(K2). The set {(en, 0), (0, fn)| n ∈N} is a CONS
of K1 ⊕K2. Hence, by Theorem 6.11 again,
{B(ei1, 0)∗· · · B(eip, 0)∗B(0, fj1)∗· · · B(0, fjq)∗ΩK1⊕K2| p, q ≥0,
i1 < · · · < ip, j1 < · · · < jq, ik, jℓ∈N, k = 1, . . . , p, ℓ= 1, . . . , q}
is a CONS of Ff(K1 ⊕K2). Hence, by the isomorphism theorem, there
exists a unique unitary operator U from Ff(K1 ⊕K2) to Ff(K1)⊗Ff(K2)
such that, for all p, q ≥0 and i1 < · · · < ip, j1 < · · · < jq, ik, jℓ∈N,
UB(ei1, 0)∗· · · B(eip, 0)∗B(0, fj1)∗· · · B(0, fjq)∗ΩK1⊕K2
= B(ei1)∗· · · B(eip)∗ΩK1 ⊗B(fj1)∗· · · B(fjq)∗ΩK2.
Hence, in particular, (6.40) holds. It is easy to see that, for each u ∈K1,
B(u)∗=
∞

n=1
⟨en, u⟩B(en)∗
in the sense of the operator norm (Problem 7(ii)). Using this fact, one can
prove (6.42).
440
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(i)
Let
Ψ
=
B(u1, 0)∗· · · B(un, 0)∗B(0, v1)∗· · · B(0, vm)∗ΩK1⊕K2.
Then,
B(u, v)∗Ψ = B(u, 0)∗Ψ + B(0, v)∗Ψ = B(u, 0)∗Ψ + (−1)nΨ ′,
where Ψ ′ := B(u1, 0)∗· · · B(un, 0)∗B(0, v)∗B(0, v1)∗· · · B(0, vm)∗ΩK1⊕K2.
Hence, by the preceding result, we have
UB(u, v)∗Ψ = (B(u)∗⊗I)UΨ + (−1)n(I ⊗B(v)∗)UΨ
= (B(u)∗⊗I)UΨ + ((−1)Nf ⊗B(v)∗)UΨ.
Since the subspace algebraically spanned by vectors of the form Ψ is dense
in Ff(K1 ⊕K2) and B(u, v)∗, B(u)∗and (−1)Nf ⊗B(v)∗are bounded, it
follows that
UB(u, v)∗= (B(u) ⊗I)U + ((−1)Nf ⊗B(v)∗)U.
Thus, (6.43) with # = ∗holds. Taking the adjoint of the operator equality
just obtained, we have (6.43) with # = ∅.
Parts (ii) and (iii) can be proved in the same way as in the boson Fock
space case.
□
Remark 6.2. Note that the operator (−1)Nf appears on the right-hand
side of (6.43). This is a big diﬀerence from the case of boson Fock spaces
(see (5.219)).
Remark 6.3. Theorem 6.21 can be extended to the case where K1 ⊕K2
is replaced by the N direct sum ⊕N
j=1Kj of Hilbert spaces K1, . . . , KN
with N ≥3. The reader is asked to ﬁll in the details of this extension
(Problem 9).
Example 6.3 (Spectra of B(u)#). Let K be a complex Hilbert space
and e1 ∈K be a unit vector arbitrarily chosen. Let K1 := {αe1|α ∈C}
and K2 := K ⊥
1
= {u ∈K | ⟨u, e1⟩= 0}. Then, K = {αe1 + v|α ∈C, v ∈
K2} ∼= K1 ⊕K2. By Theorem 6.21, there exists a unique unitary operator
U : Ff(K ) →Ff(K1) ⊗Ff(K2) such that
UBK (e1)U −1 = BK1(e1) ⊗I,
UBK (e1)∗U −1 = BK1(e1)∗⊗I.
Hence, by Theorems 3.3 and 3.4,
σ(BK (e1)#) = σ(BK1(e1)#),
σp(BK (e1)#) = σp(BK1(e1)#).
Fermion Fock Spaces
441
The spectra BK1(e1)# can be found as follows. Since dim K1 = 1, it
follows that
Ff(K1) = C ⊕K1 ∼= C ⊕C = C2,
where we use the isomorphism K1 →C given by the correspondence αe1 →
α, α ∈C. Then, under this isomorphism, BK1(e1) is unitarily equivalent to
the 2 × 2 matrix
b :=

0
1
0
0

.
Hence, BK1(e1)∗is unitarily equivalent to
b∗=

0
0
1
0

.
It is easy to see that
σ(b) = σp(b) = {0},
σ(b∗) = σp(b∗) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 1. Hence,
σ(BK1(e1)#) = σp(BK1(e1)#) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 1. Thus,
σ(BK (e1)#) = σp(BK (e1)#) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is dim Ff(K2) = 2dim K −1.
For each u ∈K \ {0}, we have BK (u)# = ∥u∥BK (e1)# with e1 :=
u/∥u∥. Thus,
σ(BK (u)#) = σp(BK (u)#) = {0},
where the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is 2dim K −1.
A related problem is given in Problem 8(i).

Representations of CAR
There is a general concept behind the fermion annihilation and creation
operators B(·) and B(·)∗.
442
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Deﬁnition 6.1. Let F be a complex Hilbert spaces and W be a complex
inner product space. Let
A(W ) := {ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈W }
be a subset of B(F).
(1) The pair (F, A(W )) is called a representation of the CAR over W
if the following (a) and (b) hold:
(a) (anti-linearity) For all f, g ∈W and α, β ∈C, ψ(αf + βg) =
α∗ψ(f) + β∗ψ(g).
(b) (CAR) For all f, g ∈W,
{ψ(f), ψ(g)} = 0,
{ψ(f), ψ(g)∗} = ⟨f, g⟩W ,
(2) The representation (F, A(W )) is said to be irreducible if A(W ) is
irreducible (see Deﬁnition 5.2(iii)).
(3) Let (F′, A′(W )), with A′(W ) := {ψ′(f), ψ′(f)∗|f ∈W }), be another
representation of the CAR over W . Then, the two representations
(F′, A′(W )) and (F, A(W )) are said to be equivalent if there exists a uni-
tary operator U : F →F′ such that, for all f ∈W , ψ′(f) = Uψ(f)U −1.
Remark 6.4. (i) Taking the adjoint of the ﬁrst equation in (b) in
Deﬁnition 6.1(1), we have {ψ(f)∗, ψ(g)∗} = 0, f, g ∈W .
(ii) It is easy to see that the representation (F, A(W )) is irreducible
if and only if there exist no proper subspaces of F which remain invari-
ant under the action of all operators ψ(f) and ψ(f)∗(f ∈W ) in A(W )
(cf. Remark 5.7).
Let D be a subspace of K . Then, (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D}) is a
representation of the CAR over D. This representation is called the Fock
representation of the CAR over D. The following fact is important.
Theorem 6.22. Suppose that D is dense in K . Then, the Fock represen-
tation (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D}) is irreducible.
Proof. Let T ∈{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D}′ so that, for all u ∈D, B(u)#T =
T B(u)#. Then, by (6.13), B(u)T ΩK
= 0. Hence, by Theorem 6.15,
there exists a constant α ∈C such that T ΩK
= αΩK . Let Ψ
:=
B(u1)∗· · · B(up)∗ΩK
(uj ∈D, j = 1, . . . , p, p ∈N). Then, it follows
from the commutativity of T and B(uj)∗that T Ψ = αΨ. Since the sub-
space algebraically spanned by vectors of the form Ψ is dense in Ff(K )
Fermion Fock Spaces
443
and T is bounded, it follows that T = αI. Thus, by Proposition 5.11(i),
{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈D} is irreducible.
□
Example 6.4. Let S ∈B(K ) such that S∗S = I, and let
BS(u) := B(Su),
u ∈K .
Then, it is easy to see that (Ff(K ), {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) is a repre-
sentation of the CAR over K . There are two cases to be considered:
(i) The case where S is unitary: In this case, we have
BS(u) = Γf(S)B(u)Γf(S)−1,
u ∈K .
Hence, (Ff(K ), {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) is equivalent to the Fock
representation (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }).
(ii) The case where S is not unitary: In this case, (RanS)⊥̸= {0}. Let
v ∈(RanS)⊥and v ̸= 0. Then, by direct computations using the CAR
for B(·)#, we have for all u ∈K ,
[BS(u), B(v)∗B(v)] = ⟨Su, v⟩B(v) = 0.
Hence, B(v)∗B(v) ∈{BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }′ and B(v)∗B(v) is not
a scalar operator (Problem 12). Therefore, {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K } is
reducible.
To analyze the structure of the reducibility of {BS(u), BS(u)∗|
u ∈K }, we note the orthogonal decomposition
K = RanS ⊕ker S∗.
Hence,
Ff(K ) ∼= Ff(RanS) ⊗Ff(ker S∗).
Under this isomorphism, BS(u)# is unitarily equivalent to B(Su)# ⊗I.
Let {Ψn}N
n=1 (N ∈N or N = ∞) be a CONS of Ff(ker S∗) and Hn =
{αΨn|α ∈C}. Then, Ff(ker S∗) = ⊕N
n=1Hn. Hence,
Ff(K ) ∼= ⊕N
n=1Ff(RanS) ⊗Hn ∼= ⊕N
n=1Mn,
where Mn
:=
Ff(RanS). Under this isomorphism, BS(u)#
is
reduced by Mn, and (Mn, {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) gives an irre-
ducible representation of the CAR over K . Since Γf(S) is a uni-
tary from Ff(K ) to Ff(RanS), we have Γf(S)B(u)#Γf(S)−1
=
BS(u)# on Ff(RanS). Hence, for each n, (Mn, {BS(u), BS(u)∗|
u ∈K }) is equivalent to (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }). Thus,
(Ff(K ), {BS(u), BS(u)∗|u ∈K }) is equivalent to the direct sum of
444
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
irreducible representations of the CAR over K , each of which is equiv-
alent to the Fock representation of the CAR over K .
6.15
Second Quantization Associated with a Representation
of CAR
The fermion second quantization dΓf(·) and the fermion annihilation and
creation operators B(·) and B(·)∗obey the characteristic commutation
relations (6.31) and (6.32). These commutation relations can be regarded as
a concrete realization of a set of abstract commutation relations. This leads
one to the notion of second quantization associated with a representation
of CAR.
Let (F, {ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈W }) be a representation of the CAR over W , as
in Deﬁnition 6.1. Then, in the same manner as in the case of representations
of CCR, one can deﬁne a notion of second quantization associated with
(F, {ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈W }), as follows.
Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator on W (the completion of W ).
A densely deﬁned closed operator H on F is called a second quantiza-
tion of T associated with (F, {ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈W }) if there exists a dense
subspace E0 of F such that, for all f ∈D(T ∗) ∩D(T )
[H, ψ(f)] = −ψ(T ∗f),
[H, ψ(f)∗] = ψ(T f)∗
on E0.
Example 6.5. By Theorem 6.16, the fermion second quantization dΓf(T )
is a second quantization of T associated with {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }.
With regard to the existence of a second quantization associated
with a representation of CAR, there exists a fermionic analogue of
Proposition 5.25. But we leave the formulation and proof to this result
as an exercise to the reader (Problem 13).
6.16
Fermionic Bogoliubov Transformations
For the fermion annihilation and creation operators also, one can consider
analogues of Bogoliubov transformations of the boson annihilation and cre-
ation operators. Let C be a conjugation on K and S, T ∈B(K ) satisfying
S∗S + T ∗T = I,
S∗T + T ∗S = 0,
(6.44)
Fermion Fock Spaces
445
where, for A ∈B(K ), A := CAC, as before. Note the diﬀerence from the
bosonic case (5.259) in that the plus sign appears on the left-hand side of
each equation in (6.44). Then, one deﬁnes
BS,T (u) := B(Su) + B(CT u)∗,
u ∈K .
It is easy to see that (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T (u)∗|u ∈K }) is a represen-
tation of the CAR over K . The correspondence {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K } →
{BS,T(u), BS,T (u)∗|u ∈K } is called the fermionic Bogoliubov trans-
formation associated with (S, T ).
Also, for the fermionic Bogoliubov transformation, one has a result cor-
responding to Theorem 5.51 on a bosonic Bogoliubov transformation.
Theorem 6.23. Consider the case where S is surjective: RanS = K .
Suppose that T is not Hilbert–Schmidt. Then, (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|
u ∈K }) is inequivalent to (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }).
Proof. The method of proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.51. We prove
the contraposition of the above statement. So suppose that there exists a
unitary operator U on Ff(K ) such that UBS,T(u)U −1 = B(u), u ∈K .
Let Ω := U −1ΩK . Then, ∥Ω∥= 1 (hence Ω ̸= 0) and BS,T(u)Ω = 0, i.e.,
B(CT u)∗Ω = −B(Su)Ω. Since S is surjective, we have
B(CLu)∗Ω = −B(u)Ω,
u ∈K ,
where L := T S−1. For each n ≥1, we deﬁne a vector Ωn in the
n-particle space by Ω(n)
n
:= Ω(n) and Ω(m)
n
:= 0, m ̸= n. Then, we have
Ω = ∞
n=0 Ωn. Since B(·)# is bounded, it follows that
∞

n=0
B(CLu)∗Ωn = −
∞

n=1
B(u)Ωn,
where we have used the face that B(u)Ω0 = 0. Hence,
B(u)Ω1 = 0,
B(CLu)∗Ωn−1 = −B(u)Ωn+1,
n ≥1.
It follows from the ﬁrst equation and Theorem 6.15 that Ω1 = 0. Then,
by the second equation with n = 2, B(u)Ω3 = 0, u ∈K . Hence, by
Theorem 6.15 again, Ω3 = 0. By induction in n, one can show that
Ω2n−1 = 0, n ≥1. Taking n = 1 in the second equation, one has
B(CLu)∗Ω0 = −B(u)Ω2. If Ω0 = 0, then B(u)Ω2 = 0, u ∈K . Hence,
446
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
by Theorem 6.15, Ω2 = 0. Then, by induction, one has Ω2n = 0, for all
n ∈Z+. Thus, Ω = 0. But this is a contradiction. Therefore, Ω0 ̸= 0. Hence,
Ω0 = αΩK with some α ∈C \ {0}. Then, B(CLu)∗ΩK = −α−1B(u)Ω2.
Taking the norm of both sides, we obtain ∥Lu∥= |α|−1∥B(u)Ω2∥. Let
{en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of K . Then, ∞
n=1 ∥Len∥2 = |α|−2 ∞
n=1 ∥B(en)Ω2∥2,
which is ﬁnite by Theorem 6.12. Hence, L is Hilbert–Schmidt. Thu,s T = LS
is Hilbert–Schmidt.
□
With regard to the irreducibility of {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }, the
following theorem holds.
Theorem 6.24. Assume (6.44) and
SS∗+ T T
∗= I,
ST ∗+ T S
∗= 0.
(6.45)
Then, (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }) is an irreducible representa-
tion of the CAR over K .
Proof. Using (6.45), one can express B(u) in terms of BS,T(·)# as follows:
B(u) = BS,T (S∗u) + BS,T (T ∗Cu)∗,
u ∈K .
Hence, for all A ∈{BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }′, A ∈{B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈
K }′ = CI. Therefore, {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }′ = CI. Thus, the
desired result follows.
□
Remark 6.5. Under conditions (6.44) and (6.45), one can prove the con-
verse of Theorem 6.23:
If T is Hilbert–Schmidt, then (Ff(K ), {BS,T(u), BS,T(u)∗|u ∈K }) is
equivalent to (Ff(K ), {B(u), B(u)∗|u ∈K }).
For a proof of this fact, see, for example, Ottesen (1995), Theorem 3.
A general theory of diagonalizations of a class of Fermi ﬁeld Hamiltoni-
ans by fermionic Bogoliubov transformations is found in the work of Araki
(1968).

Chapter 7
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and
Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type
Operators
The tensor product of a boson Fock space and a fermion Fock space gives a
new Hilbert space, called a boson–fermion Fock space, which, in applications to
quantum ﬁeld theory, forms a mathematical framework to describe interactions
of a Bose ﬁeld and a Fermi ﬁeld. In this chapter, we discuss the fundamental
aspects of analysis on a boson–fermion Fock space.
7.1
Fundamental Structures of a Boson–Fermion
Fock Space
Let H and K be complex Hilbert spaces. Then, the tensor product
F(H , K ) := Fb(H ) ⊗Ff(K )
of the boson Fock space Fb(H ) and the fermion Fock space Ff(K ) is
called the boson–fermion Fock space over the pair (H , K ) of Hilbert
spaces.
The concept of a boson–fermion Fock space is a general concept unifying
in a natural way both a boson Fock space and a fermion Fock space. Indeed,
there exists an isometry Ub from Fb(H ) into F(H , K ) such that
UbΨ = Ψ ⊗ΩK ,
Ψ ∈Fb(H ).
In this sense, the boson Fock space Fb(H ) is isomorphic to the sub-
space Fb(H ) ⊗{αΩK |α ∈C} of F(H , K ). Similarly, the fermion Fock
space Ff(K ) is isomorphic to the subspace {αΩH |α ∈C} ⊗Ff(K ) of
F(H , K ).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A boson–fermion Fock space, as an extension of a boson Fock space and
a fermion Fock space, may have a variety of operators which are essentially
diﬀerent from those on a boson Fock space as well as on a fermion Fock
space. It would be interesting to ﬁnd such operators and analyze them.
In addition, from a mathematical physics point of view, one is led to con-
sider their roles in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory.
Remark 7.1. Consider the case where H and K are ﬁnite dimensional,
with dim H = n and dim K = r. Then, under the isomorphism H ∼= Cn
and K ∼= Cr, we have
Fb(H ) ∼= L2(Rn),
∧(K ) ∼= ∧(Cr).
Hence, under these isomorphisms,
F(H , K ) ∼= L2(Rn) ⊗∧(Cr).
(7.1)
As a ﬁrst step toward analysis on a boson–fermion Fock space, we begin
with considering a basic structure of a boson–fermion Fock space.
Lemma 7.1. Let X and Yn (n ∈{0} ∪N) be Hilbert spaces and
Y := ⊕∞
n=0Yn.
Let
Z := ⊕∞
n=0X ⊗Yn.
Then, there exists a unique unitary transformation U : X ⊗Y →Z such
that, for all ψ ∈X , φ = {φ(n)}∞
n=0 ∈Y ,
U(ψ ⊗φ) = {ψ ⊗φ(n)}∞
n=0.
(7.2)
Proof. Let {eα}α∈A be a CONS of X (A is an index set). Then, D0 :=
span {eα ⊗φ|α ∈A, φ ∈Y } is dense in X ⊗Y . Each vector Ψ ∈D0 is
uniquely written as Ψ = N
k=1 eαk ⊗φk, with αk ∈A, φk = {φ(n)
k }∞
n=0 ∈Y .
Deﬁne a linear mapping U0 : D0 →Z by
U0(Ψ) :=
 N

k=1
eαk ⊗φ(n)
k
∞
n=0
.
By direct computations, we have
∥U0(Ψ)∥2 =
∞

n=0

=
N

k=1
∥φk∥2 = ∥Ψ∥2.
Hence, U0 is isometry. On the other hand, the algebraic inﬁnite direct sum
⊕
∞
n=0

span {eα|α ∈A})⊗Yn
	
is dense inse Z . Hence, Ran(U0) is dense in
Z . Thus, U0 has a unique unitary extension U : X ⊗Y →Z . This unitary
operator U satisﬁes (7.2). It is easy to prove the uniqueness of U.
□
Henceforth, we sometimes write
X ⊗Y = ⊕∞
n=0X ⊗Yn
in the sense of the isomorphism in Lemma 7.1.
We introduce the subspaces
F (n)
b
(H , K ) := (⊗n
s H ) ⊗Ff(K ),
n ≥0,

p(H , K ) := Fb(H ) ⊗∧p(K ),
p ≥0.
By a simple application of Lemma 7.1, we have the following identiﬁcations:
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
n=0F (n)
b
(H , K ),
(7.3)
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
p=0

p
(H , K ).
(7.4)
Moreover, noting that

p
(H , K ) = ⊕∞
n=0 [(⊗n
s H ) ⊗∧p(K )] ,
we have
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
p=0 ⊕∞
n=0 [(⊗n
s H ) ⊗∧p(K )] .
(7.5)
Hence, introducing
Fr(H , K ) := ⊕n+p=r [(⊗n
s H ) ⊗∧p(K )] ,
we obtain
F(H , K ) = ⊕∞
r=0Fr(H , K ).
(7.6)
Let us consider the meaning of the orthogonal decompositions (7.3),
(7.4) and (7.6). The boson number operator Nb on Fb(H ) is extended
454
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
to Nb ⊗I as an operator on F(H , K ). Similarly, the fermion number
operator Nf on Ff(K ) yields I ⊗Nf acting in F(H , K ). We have
Nb ⊗IΨ = nΨ,
Ψ ∈F (n)
b
(H , K ).
Hence, F (n)
b
(H , K ) is the eigenspace of Nb ⊗I with eigenvalue n. There-
fore, (7.3) is the orthogonal decomposition of F(H , K ) in terms of the
eigenspaces of Nb ⊗I.
Similarly, one can see that p(H , K ) is the eigenspace of I ⊗Nf
with eigenvalue p, and hence (7.4) gives the orthogonal decomposition of
F(H , K ) in terms of these eigenspaces.
The operator sum
Ntot := Nb ⊗I + I ⊗Nf
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on F(H , K ). We call it the total
number operator on F(H , K ).
As is easily seen, for each r ≥0, Fr(H , K ) is the eigenspace of
Ntot with eigenvalue r. Hence, (7.6) is the orthogonal decomposition of
F(H , K ) in terms of the eigenspaces of Ntot.
Remark 7.2. Let H be the complexiﬁcation of a real separable inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space. Then, as we have seen in Theorem 5.56, Fb(H )
is isomorphic to L2( ˙R∞, dμ) in a natural way. Hence,
∧p(H , K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dμ) ⊗∧p(K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dμ; ∧p(K )).
An element in L2( ˙R∞, dμ; ∧p(K )) can be interpreted as a p-form on the
inﬁnite-dimensional space ˙R∞. Therefore, ∧p(H , K ) can be viewed as a
space of p-forms on an inﬁnite-dimensional space. We also have
F(H , K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dμ) ⊗Ff(K ) ∼= L2( ˙R∞, dμ; Ff(K )).
7.2
Second Quantization Operators on the Boson–Fermion
Fock Space F(H , K )
Let T1 and T2 be densely deﬁned closable operators on H and K , respec-
tively. Then, one can deﬁne
dΓ(T1, T2) := dΓb(T1) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(T2).
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
455
We call this operator the second quantization operator for the pair
(T1, T2).
Proposition 7.1. Let T1 and T2 be self-adjoint. Then:
(i) dΓ(T1, T2) is self-adjoint.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are non-negative, then dΓ(T1, T2) is non-negative.
(iii) If F1 is a core for dΓb(T1) and F2 is a core for dΓf(T2), then F1 ˆ⊗F2
is a core for dΓ(T1, T2).
Proof. (i) Under the present assumption, dΓb(T1) and dΓf(T2) are self-
adjoint. Hence, by a simple application of Theorem 3.8(i), dΓ(T1, T2) is
self-adjoint.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are non-negative, then so are dΓb(T1) and dΓf(T2).
Hence, dΓ(T1, T2) is non-negative.
(iii) This follows from an application of Theorem 3.8(iii).
□
One can also apply other results in the theory of tensor products of
self-adjoint operators as presented in Chapter 3 to study more detailed
properties of dΓ(T1, T2), such as its spectral ones. But, here, we do not go
into the details. The reader is asked to work on those aspects.
A natural extension of Γ-operators in the boson Fock space and the
fermion Fock space is given by
Γ(T1, T2) := Γb(T1) ⊗Γf(T2).
On this object too, we only state a few facts (a more detailed study is of
course possible).
Proposition 7.2.
(i) If T1 and T2 are contractions, then Γ(T1, T2) is a contraction.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are unitary operators, then Γ(T1, T2) is unitary.
(iii) If A and B are self-adjoint operators on H and K, respectively, then
Γ(eitA, eitB) = eitdΓ(A,B),
t ∈R.
(iv) If A and B are self-adjoint operators on H and K, respectively, and
bounded from below, then
Γ(e−tA, e−tB) = e−tdΓ(A,B),
t ≥0.
456
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) If T1 and T2 are contractions, then so are Γb(T1) and Γf(T2).
Hence, Γb(T1) ⊗Γf(T2) is a contraction.
(ii) If T1 and T2 are unitary operators, then so are Γb(T1) and Γf(T2).
Hence, Γb(T1) ⊗Γf(T2) is unitary.
(iii) The self-adjoint operators dΓb(A) ⊗I and I ⊗dΓf(B) strongly
commute. Hence, for all t ∈R,
eidΓ(A,B) = eitdΓb(A) ⊗eitdΓf(B) = Γb(eitA) ⊗Γf(eitB).
Hence, the desired result follows.
(iv) Similar to the proof of (iii).

7.3
Operators of Co-boundary Type
In this section, we introduce an inﬁnite-dimensional version of exterior
diﬀerential operators on ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds (see (7.1)1).
We denote by C(H , K ) the set of densely deﬁned closed linear operators
from H to K . Let S ∈C(H , K ). Then, D(S∗) is dense in K . Hence, there
exists a CONS {ξn}∞
n=1 of K such that ξn ∈D(S∗), n ∈N. For each N ∈N,
we deﬁne a linear operator dS,N on F(H , K ) by
dS,N :=
N

n=1
A(S∗ξn) ⊗B(ξn)∗,
where A(f) is the boson annihilation operator with test vector f ∈H and
B(g)∗is the fermion creation operator with test vector g ∈K . It is obvious
that
D(dS,N) ⊃Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗Ff(K ).
and dS,N leaves Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗Ff(K ) invariant.
Lemma 7.2. For all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ),
dSΨ := s- lim
N→∞dS,NΨ
(7.7)
exists and, for all ℓ∈N, fj ∈D(S) (j = 1, . . . , ℓ) and φ ∈Ff(K ),
dSΩH ⊗φ = 0,
(7.8)
1For example, in the Hilbert space L2(Rn) ⊗∧(Cn) (the case r = n), an exterior
diﬀerential operator is given by d = n
j=1 ∂j⊗b∗
j , where bj := B(ej)∗(j = 1, . . . , n), with
{ej}n
j=1 being the standard basis of Cn. It is easy to see that d2 = 0 on C∞
0 (Rn)ˆ⊗∧(Cn).

where 
A(fj) indicates the omission of A(fj).
Proof. Let fj ∈D(S) (j = 1, . . . , ℓ) and φ ∈Ff(K ). Then, using the
CCR for A(·)# and the fact that, for all f ∈H , A(f)ΩH = 0, we have
dS,NΩH ⊗φ = 0,

where u(j)

:= N
n=1 ⟨ξn, Sfj⟩ξn. Since {ξn}∞
n=1 is a CONS of K , it fol-
lows that limN→∞u(j)
N = Sfj. Hence, limN→∞∥B(u(j)
N )∗−B(Sfj)∗∥= 0.
Therefore,

Thus, the desired results follow.
□
The mapping dS : Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) →F(H , K ) deﬁned by (7.7)
can be viewed as a linear operator on F(H , K ) with domain D(dS) =
Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ). By (7.9), it is independent of the choice of {ξn}∞
n=1.
Remark 7.3. In the case where dim K < ∞, we deﬁne dS by
dS :=
dim K

n=1
A(S∗ξn) ⊗B(ξn)∗.
In this case too, (7.9) holds, and hence dS is independent of the choice of
the orthonormal basis {ξn}dim K
n=1
.

on a suitable dense subspace. The operator on the right-hand side with
H = K and S = I (identity) can be viewed as an inﬁnite-dimensional
version of an exterior diﬀerential operator on a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold.
Thus, dS with a general triple (H , K , S) may be regarded as an abstract
version of the operators of exterior diﬀerential type on ﬁnite-dimensional
manifolds.
Since Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) is dense in F(H , K ), dS is densely
deﬁned.
Proposition 7.3. Let S, T ∈C(H , K ).
(i) The operator dS leaves Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) invariant.
(ii) The operators dS and dT anti-commute on Fb,ﬁn(D(S) ∩D(T )) ˆ⊗
Ff(K ):
{dS, dT } = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(D(S) ∩D(T ))ˆ⊗Ff(K ).

In particular,

(iv) The operator dS is closable.
Proof. (i) This follows from (7.9).
(ii) Let Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fℓ)∗ΩH ⊗φ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(S) ∩D(T ))ˆ⊗Ff(K ).

(7.14)
Since B(T fk)∗B(Sfj)∗= −B(Sfj)∗B(T fk)∗, it follows that the right-hand
side of (7.14) is equal to −dSdT Ψ. Hence, {dT , dS}Ψ = 0. Therefore, (7.10)
holds. Taking T = S in (7.10), one obtains (7.11).
(iii) Let ψ ∈Fb,0(H ), uk ∈D(S∗) (k = 1, . . . , m) and
φm := B(u1)∗· · · B(um)∗ΩK .
Then, ψ ⊗φm ∈Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(S∗)) and, for all Ψ ∈D(dS),

Therefore, ψ ⊗ΩK ∈D(d∗

Therefore, Fb,0(H )ˆ⊗∧ﬁn(D(S∗)) ⊂D(d∗

(iv) By (iii), D(d∗
S) is dense. Hence, dS is closable.
□
In what follows, for notational simplicity, we denote the closure of
dS by the same symbol. Hence, dS is a densely deﬁned closed operator

461
such that
Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) ⊂D(dS)
and Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) is a core for dS.
It follows from the deﬁnition of dS that, for all α ∈C,
dαS = αdS.
(7.16)
Proposition 7.4.
(i) For all Ψ ∈D(dS), Ψ ∈D(d2
S) and d2
SΨ = 0.
(ii) For all Φ ∈D(d∗
S), Φ ∈D((d∗
S)2) and (d∗
S)2Φ = 0.
Proof. (i) There exists a sequence {Ψn}n in Fb,ﬁn(D(S))ˆ⊗Ff(K ) such
that Ψn →Ψ and dSΨn →dSΨ (n →∞). By (7.11), dS(dSΨn) = 0. Hence,
by the closedness of dS, dSΨ ∈D(dS) and dS(dSψ) = 0.
(ii) By (i), for all Ψ ∈D(dS) and Φ ∈D(d∗
S),

Φ, d2

⟨d∗
SΦ, dSΨ⟩= 0 = ⟨0, Ψ⟩. Hence, d∗
SΦ ∈D(d∗
S) and d∗
S(d∗
SΦ) = 0.
□
It is seen from the deﬁnition of dS that, for each p ≥0, dS maps D(dS)∩
p(H , K ) into p+1(H , K ). Hence, an operator dS,p from p(H , K )
to p+1(H , K ) is naturally deﬁned as follows2:
D(dS,p) := D(dS) ∩

p
(H , K ),
dS,pΨ := (dSΨ)(p+1), Ψ ∈D(dS,p).
Proposition 7.5. For all p ≥0, dS,p+1dS,p = 0 on D(dS,p).
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(dS,p). Then, by Proposition 7.4(i), d2
SΨ = 0. Hence,
0 = (d2
SΨ)(p+2) = dS,p+1(dSΨ)(p+1) = dS,p+1dS,pΨ.
□
Proposition 7.5 implies that
Ran dS,p ⊂ker dS,p+1.
(7.17)
Proposition 7.5 means that the sequence (⊕

Laplace–Beltrami Operators
Based on an analogy with analysis on diﬀerential forms on a ﬁnite-
dimensional manifold, it is natural to consider the operator
ΔS,p := d∗
S,pdS,p + dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1,
p ≥0,
(7.20)
acting in ∧p(H , K ), where dS,−1 := 0. We call this operator the pth
Laplace–Beltrami operator associated with the co-chain complex
(⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS). We have
ΔS,0 = d∗
S,0dS,0.
(7.21)
To study the properties of ΔS,p, we prepare some lemmas.
Lemma 7.3. Let X and Y be Hilbert spaces and A, B be closed operators
from X to Y such that, for all ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B), ⟨Aψ, Bψ⟩= 0. Then,
∥(A + B)ψ∥2 = ∥Aψ∥2 + ∥Bψ∥2,
ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(B).
(7.22)
In particular, A + B is closed.
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
463
Proof. Equation (7.22) follows from direct commutations and the assumed
property for A and B. Then, by Theorem 1.6, A + B is closed.
□
We introduce a subspace
DS,p := Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗S))ˆ⊗Ap(ˆ⊗
pD(SS∗)),
p ≥0.
(7.23)
According to von Neumann’s theorem, D(S∗S) and D(SS∗) are dense in
H and K , respectively, and S∗S and SS∗are non-negative self-adjoint
operators. Hence, DS,p is dense in ∧p(H , K ).
Lemma 7.4. For all p ≥0, ΔS,p is a closed, non-negative symmetric oper-
ator, with
DS,p ⊂D(ΔS,p)
(7.24)
and, for all Ψ ∈D(ΔS,p),
∥ΔS,pΨ∥2 = ∥d∗
S,pdS,pΨ∥2 + ∥dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1Ψ∥2.
(7.25)
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D(d∗
S,pdS,p) ∩D(dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1). Then, by Proposition 7.5,

d∗
S,pdS,pΨ, dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1Ψ

= 0.
Hence, by Lemma 7.3, ΔS,p is closed and (7.25) holds.
It follows from (7.9) and (7.13) that
Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗S))ˆ⊗∧ﬁn (D(SS∗)) ⊂D(d∗
SdS) ∩D(dSd∗
S).
Hence, it follows that
DS,p ⊂D(d∗
S,pdS,p) ∩D(dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1).
Therefore, (7.24) holds and ΔS,p is densely deﬁned. According to von Neu-
mann’s theorem, d∗
S,pdS,p and dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1 are non-negative self-adjoint.
Thus, ΔS,p is a non-negative symmetric operator.
□
For a self-adjoint operator T on K , we deﬁne
dΓ(p)
f
(T ) := T (p)
f
(7.26)
(see (6.2)).
We now prove an important theorem.
464
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields

and operator equality
ΔS,p = dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)

Proof. Let n ∈N, fj ∈D(S∗S) (j = 1, . . . , n), uk ∈D(SS∗) (k = 1, . . . , p)

By using the anti-commutativity of B(·)∗’s, we have

= [dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗)]Ψ(f1, . . . , fn; u1, . . . , up).
This means that (7.27) holds on DS,p. Namely,
[dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗)] ↾DS,p ⊂ΔS,p
The
subspace
Fb,ﬁn(D(S∗S))
is
a
core
for
dΓb(S∗S),
and
Ap(ˆ⊗
pD(SS∗)) is a core for dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗). Hence, DS,p is a core for
dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗). As we already know, dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I +
I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗) is self-adjoint and ΔS,p is closed. Hence,
dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗) ⊂ΔS,p.
But a self-adjoint operator has no non-trivial symmetric extension. Thus,
operator equality (7.27) follows and, at the same time, the self-adjointness
of ΔS,p is proved.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 7.1 is interesting in that it clariﬁes the homological origin of
a class of operators made of second quantization operators on the boson–
fermion Fock space F(H , K ) (note that I ⊗dΓ(p)
f
(SS∗) is a reduced part
of I ⊗dΓf(SS∗)).
We also consider the operator
ΔS := d∗

S
acting in F(H , K ). We call it the total Laplace–Beltrami operator
associated with the co-chain complex (⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS).
Theorem 7.2. The operator equality
ΔS = ⊕∞

holds. In particular, ΔS is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove that

(7.29)
Let Ψ = {Ψ (p)}∞
p=0 ∈D(ΔS). Then, Ψ ∈D(d∗

(d∗
SdSΨ)(p) = d∗
S,p(dSΨ)(p+1) = d∗
S,pdS,pΨ (p).
(7.30)
Similarly, property Ψ ∈D(dSd∗

D(dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1) and
(dSd∗
SΨ)(p) = dS,p−1d∗
S,p−1Ψ (p).

Hence, Ψ ∈D(ΔS). Thus, (7.29) holds.
It follows from (7.30) and (7.31) that (ΔSΨ)(p) = ΔS,pΨ (p), Ψ ∈D(ΔS).
This equation and (7.29) imply (7.28).
The operator on the right-hand side of (7.28) is a non-negative self-
adjoint operator. Hence, so is ΔS.
□
Theorem 7.2 is rephrased as follows.
468
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Corollary 7.1. The operator ΔS is reduced by each ∧p(H , K ) (p ≥0),
and its reduced part to ∧p(H , K ) is ΔS,p.
The operator ΔS is related to second quantization operators in a beau-
tiful way.
Theorem 7.3. The following operator equality holds.
ΔS = dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(SS∗)
(7.32)
Proof. It follows from Theorem 7.1 that
⊕∞
p=0ΔS,p = dΓb(S∗S) ⊗I + I ⊗dΓf(SS∗).
By this fact and Theorem 7.2, we obtain (7.32).

We next want to consider the cohomology group associated with the co-

the reader’s convenience, we ﬁrst recall the concept of quotient space of a
Hilbert space.
7.5
Quotient Hilbert Space
Let X be a vector space over K and M be a subspace of X . Then, one
can deﬁne a relation
M∼in X by
ψ
M∼φ
def
⇐⇒ψ −φ ∈M
(ψ, φ ∈X ).
It is easy to see that the relation
M∼is an equivalence relation. For each
ψ ∈X , we denote by [ψ] the equivalence class of ψ:
[ψ] := {φ ∈X |φ
M∼ψ}.
The set of all equivalence classes
X /M := {[ψ]|ψ ∈X }
becomes a vector space by the following additive operation + and scalar
multiplication:
[ψ] + [φ] := [ψ + φ],
α[ψ] := [αψ],
ψ, φ ∈X , α ∈K.
This vector space is called the quotient space of X by M . The zero
vector in X /M is [η] with η ∈M .

469
Let us consider the case where X is a Hilbert space and M is a closed
subspace of X . We denote by P⊥the orthogonal projection onto M ⊥.
For each element ([ψ], [φ]) ∈(X /M ) × (X /M ), we deﬁne a number
⟨[ψ], [φ]⟩X /M ∈K by
⟨[ψ], [φ]⟩X /M := ⟨P⊥ψ, P⊥φ⟩.
It is easy to show that this is well deﬁned (i.e., it is independent of the
choice of the representatives of [ψ] and [φ])3 and ⟨·, ·⟩X /M is an inner
product of X /M .4 Moreover, the inner product space X /M is complete,
i.e., it is a Hilbert space.5 The Hilbert space (X /M , ⟨·, ·⟩X /M ) is called
the quotient Hilbert space of X by M .
Lemma 7.5. The quotient Hilbert space X /M is isomorphic to M ⊥by
the correspondence
[ψ] →P⊥ψ,
[ψ] ∈X /M .
(7.33)
Proof. Let U denote the correspondence given by (7.33): U[ψ] := P⊥ψ. It
is easy to see that U is well deﬁned and linear. For each φ ∈M ⊥, U[φ] =
P⊥φ = φ. Hence, U is surjective. We have ∥U[ψ]∥= ∥P⊥ψ∥= ∥[ψ]∥X /M.
Hence, U is an isometry. Thus, U is unitary.
□
In the sense of the isomorphism stated in Lemma 7.5, we write
X /M ∼= M ⊥.
7.6
Cohomology Groups and De Rham–Hodge–Kodaira
Decomposition
We now turn to the co-chain complex (⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS). By analogy of the
de Rham cohomology group on a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold, we introduce
the following sets:
H0
S := ker dS,0,
Hp
S := ker dS,p/Ran dS,p−1,
p ≥1.
3Note that, if ψ
M
∼ψ′ ∈X and φ
M
∼φ′ ∈X , then P⊥(ψ −ψ′) = 0, P⊥(φ −φ′) = 0,
and hence P⊥ψ = P⊥ψ′, P⊥φ = P⊥φ′.
4If ∥[ψ]∥X /M = 0, then P⊥ψ = 0, implying ψ ∈M , where the closedness of M is
used. Hence, [ψ] = 0. Therefore, the positive deﬁniteness of the inner product holds.
Other properties of the inner product can be easily checked.
5Let {[ψn]}∞
n=1 be a Cauchy sequence in X /M . Then, {P⊥ψn}∞
n=1 is a Cauchy
sequence in X . Since M ⊥is closed, there exists a vector φ ∈M ⊥such that P⊥ψn →
φ (n →∞). Using the fact that P⊥φ = φ, we see that ∥[ψn] −[φ]∥X /M →0 (n →∞).
Thus, X /M is complete.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The set H0
S is a Hilbert space as a closed subspace of 0(H , K ) and, as
we have seen above, Hp
S (p ≥1) is a quotient Hilbert space (note that, by
(7.17), Ran dS,p−1 ⊂ker dS,p). We call Hp
S the pth cohomology group
associated with (⊕
∞
p=0D(dS,p), dS).
By Lemma 7.5 and the fact that D⊥= D
⊥for all subsets D of a Hilbert
space, we have
Hp
S ∼= (Ran dS,p−1)⊥∩ker dS,p,
p ≥1.
(7.34)
This gives an isomorphism of Hp
S. But the Hilbert space (Ran dS,p−1)⊥∩
ker dS,p is somewhat diﬃcult to grasp in a direct way. Thus, we want to
ﬁnd another isomorphism of Hp
S. For this purpose, we ﬁrst prove a general
fact, as follows.
Lemma 7.6. Let H1, H2 and H3 be complex Hilbert spaces and Ai (i =
1, 2) be a densely deﬁned closed operator from Hi to Hi+1 such that, for
all η ∈D(A1) and φ ∈D(A∗
2), ⟨A1η, A∗
2φ⟩= 0. Let
LA1,A2 := A1A∗
1 + A∗
2A2
acting in H2. Then, LA1,A2 is a closed operator and
H2 = RanA1 ⊕RanA∗
2 ⊕ker LA1,A2.
Proof. It follows from the assumption that, for all ψ ∈D(A1A∗
1) ∩
D(A∗
2A2), ⟨A1A∗
1ψ, A∗
2A2ψ⟩= 0. Hence, by Lemma 7.3, LA1,A2 is closed.
The assumption also implies that RanA1 is orthogonal to RanA∗
2. Hence,
we have the orthogonal decomposition
H2 = RanA1 ⊕RanA∗
2 ⊕W,
where W :=

RanA1 ⊕RanA∗
2
	⊥= (RanA1)⊥∩(RanA∗
2)⊥.
Let Ψ ∈W. Then, for all Φ ∈D(A1), ⟨Ψ, A1Φ⟩= 0. Hence, Ψ ∈D(A∗
1)
and A∗
1Ψ = 0. Also, for all Ξ ∈D(A∗
2), ⟨Ψ, A∗
2Ξ⟩= 0. Hence, Ψ ∈D(A2)
and A2Ψ = 0. Therefore, Ψ ∈D(LA1,A2) and LA1,A2Ψ = 0. Hence, Ψ ∈
ker LA1,A2. Thus, W ⊂ker LA1,A2.
Conversely, let Ψ ∈ker LA1,A2. Then, Ψ ∈D(A∗
2A2) ∩D(A1A∗
1) and
A∗
2A2Ψ + A1A∗
1Ψ = 0. Taking the inner product of this equation with Ψ,
we have ∥A2Ψ∥2 + ∥A∗
1Ψ∥2 = 0, which implies that A2Ψ = 0 and A∗
1Ψ = 0.
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
471
This means that Ψ ∈(RanA∗
2)⊥∩(RanA1)⊥. Hence, Ψ ∈W. Therefore,
ker LA1,A2 ⊂W. Thus, we arrive at W = ker LA1,A2.
□
Now, we can prove a decomposition theorem with respect to {dS,p}∞
p=0.
Theorem 7.4 (Decomposition of de Rham–Hodge–Kodaira type).
For all p ≥0, the orthogonal decomposition

p(H , K ) = Ran dS,p−1 ⊕Ran d∗
S,p ⊕ker ΔS,p
(7.35)
holds.
Proof. We need only to apply Lemma 7.6 to the case where H1 =
∧p−1(H , K ), H2 = ∧p(H , K ), H3 = ∧p+1(H , K ), A1 = dS,p−1 and
A2 = dS,p.
□
7.7
Identiﬁcation of the Cohomology Groups
We now proceed to identifying Hp
S.
Proposition 7.7. For all p ≥0,
ker dS,p = Ran dS,p−1 ⊕ker ΔS,p.
(7.36)
Proof. Applying Theorem 1.10(ii) to the case where T = dS,p, we have

p
(H , K ) = ker dS,p ⊕Rand∗
S,p.
Comparing this with (7.35), we obtain (7.36).
□
Lemma 7.7. Let T be a densely deﬁned operator from a Hilbert space X
to a Hilbert space Y . Then, ker T ∗T = ker T .
Proof. Let ψ ∈ker T ∗T . Then, T ∗T ψ = 0. Hence, 0 = ⟨ψ, T ∗T ψ⟩=
⟨T ψ, T ψ⟩. Hence, T ψ = 0, implying that ψ ∈ker T . Thus, ker T ∗T ⊂ker T .
The converse inclusion relation is obvious.
□
Theorem 7.5.
H0
S = ker ΔS,0,
(7.37)
Hp
S ∼= ker ΔS,p,
p ≥1.
(7.38)
Proof. By Lemma 7.7, ker dS,0 = ker d∗
S,0dS,0 = ker ΔS,0. Hence, (7.37)
holds. Isomorphism (7.38) follows from (7.34) and (7.36).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By Theorem 7.5, the analysis of the pth cohomology group Hp
S is reduced
to that of ker ΔS,p. Hence, we investigate this space as follows. However,
for this purpose, we need to know the properties of the kernel of operators.
Since they have independent interests, we here take an interlude to describe
them.
7.8
Properties of Kernel of Some Operators
Lemma 7.8. Let A be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert
space. Then, ker A = ker A1/2.
Proof. We have A = A1/2A1/2. Hence, a simple application of Lemma 7.7
to the case T = A1/2 gives the desired result.
□
Lemma 7.9. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space X . Then,
A is reduced by ker A, and A is decomposed as A = 0 ⊕A⊥according to
the orthogonal decomposition X = ker A ⊕(ker A)⊥, where A⊥is the part
of A reduced to (ker A)⊥.
Proof. Let P be the orthogonal projection onto ker A. Then, for all ψ ∈
D(A), Pψ ∈ker A. Hence, Pψ ∈D(A) and APψ = 0. Hence, for all φ ∈
D(A), ⟨PAφ, ψ⟩= 0. Since D(A) is dense, PAφ = 0. Hence, APψ = 0 =
PAψ. Therefore, PA ⊂AP. Thus, A is reduced by ker A. By the argument
just made, the reduced part of A to ker A is the zero operator on ker A.
Thus, A = 0 ⊕A⊥.

Lemma 7.10. Let Hj (j = 1, . . . , N) be a Hilbert space and Mj be a closed
subspace of Hj. Then,
∩N
j=1 (H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hj−1 ⊗Mj ⊗Hj+1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn) = ⊗N
j=1Mj.
Proof. We give a proof only for the case of N = 2 (its extension to a
general N is easy). Obviously, we have
M1 ⊗M2 ⊂(M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2).
Taking the closure of both sides and noting that the set on the right-hand
side is a closed set, we obtain
M1 ⊗M2 ⊂(M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2).
Conversely, let ψ ∈(M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2). Then, ψ ∈M1 ⊗H2 =
(M1 ⊗M2) ⊕(M1 ⊗M2
⊥). Hence, we have ψ = u + v, with u ∈M1 ⊗M2
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
473
and v ∈(M1 ⊗M ⊥
2 ). Under the other condition ψ ∈H1 ⊗M2, we have
ψ −u ∈H1 ⊗M2. Hence, ⟨ψ −u, v⟩= 0. This implies that v = 0. Hence,
ψ = u ∈M1 ⊗M2. Therefore, (M1 ⊗H2) ∩(H1 ⊗M2) ⊂M1 ⊗M2.

j=1 Tjψ = 0.
Taking the inner product of this equation and ψ, we have

j=1
⟨ψ, Tjψ⟩= 0.
By the non-negativity of Tj, ⟨ψ, Tjψ⟩≥0. Hence, for each j = 1, . . . , N,
⟨ψ, Tjψ⟩= 0. This implies that T 1/2
j
ψ = 0. Hence, by Lemma 7.8,
ψ ∈ker Tj. Therefore, ker

ψ = PMφ. By the reducibility of A by M , ψ ∈D(A) ∩M = D(AM ) and
AM ψ = APM φ = PM Aφ = 0. Hence, ψ ∈ker AM . Therefore, PM ker A ⊂
ker AM .
Conversely, let ψ ∈ker AM . Then, ψ ∈D(A) ∩M and Aψ = 0. Hence,
ψ ∈ker A. By this fact and ψ ∈M , ψ = PM ψ ∈PM ker A. Hence,

Then, for all p ≥0,

In particular, if p > dim ker S∗, then ker ΔS,p = {0}.

ker ΔS,p = ker dΓb(S∗S) ⊗ker dΓ(p)

Using (7.44) and (7.45), we can rewrite the right-hand side to obtain
ker ΔS,p = ⊕∞

By Lemma 7.7, ker S∗S = ker S and ker SS∗= ker S∗. Thus, (7.47) follows.
If p > dim kerS∗, then ∧p ker S∗= {0}. Hence, ker ΔS,p = {0}.

Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators on
F(H , K )
Besides the Laplace–Beltrami operator ΔS, there is a natural operator made
of dS, which is deﬁned as follows:
QS := dS + d∗
S.
Note that QS is twice the real part of dS.6 Taking into account that dS
is an operator of exterior diﬀerential type, as pointed out in Remark 7.4,
we may regard the operator QS as an inﬁnite-dimensional Dirac-type
operator if H is inﬁnite dimensional.7 From this point of view, we call
QS the Dirac operator associated with the operator S. We shall
justify this name in a more general context later (see Proposition 7.8 in the
following section).
Remark 7.5. One can also consider twice the imaginary part of dS:
QS := −i(dS −d∗
S).
But, by (7.16), idS = diS and −id∗
S = d∗
iS. Hence,
QS = −QiS.
Therefore, QS is an element in {QS|S ∈C(H , K )}. One has
dS = 1
2(QS + i QS)
on D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S).
It is obvious that QS is symmetric. Then, it is interesting to ask if QS
is (essentially) self-adjoint. The answer is in the aﬃrmative. But to prove
it, we need a lemma.
Lemma 7.13. Let A be a symmetric operator on a Hilbert space X such
that A2 is self-adjoint. Then, A is self-adjoint.
6In general, for a linear operator A on a Hilbert space, A1 := (A + A∗)/2 and A2 :=
(A −A∗)/2i are called the real part and the imaginary part of A, respectively. One
has A = A1 + iA2 on D(A) ∩D(A∗).
7For ﬁnite-dimensional Dirac operators, see, for example, Balinsky and Evans (2011)
and Thaller (1992).
478
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. By the self-adjointness of A2 and A2 ≥0, Ran(A2 + 1) = X (see
Proposition 1.29). On the other hand, we have
A2 + 1 = (A + i)(A −i) = (A −i)(A + i).
Hence, Ran(A ± i) = X . Hence, by a criterion for self-adjointness (Propo-
sition 1.28), A is self-adjoint.
□
Theorem 7.10.
(i) The operator QS is self-adjoint, and the operator equality
Q2
S = ΔS
(7.49)
holds.
(ii) Every core for ΔS is a core for QS.
Proof. (i) Since D(QS) = D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S), we have
D(Q2
S) = {Ψ ∈D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S)|dSΨ + d∗
SΨ ∈D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S)}.
It follows from this and Proposition 7.4 that each Ψ ∈D(Q2
S) is in
D(d∗
SdS) ∩D(dSd∗
S) = D(ΔS) and Q2
SΨ = ΔSΨ. Hence, Q2
S ⊂ΔS.
Conversely, let Ψ ∈D(ΔS). Then, Ψ ∈D(d∗
SdS) ∩D(dSd∗
S). Hence,
Ψ ∈D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S) = D(QS) and dSΨ ∈D(d∗
S), d∗
SΨ ∈D(dS). By Proposi-
tion 7.4, dSΨ ∈D(dS) and d∗
SΨ ∈D(d∗
S). Hence, dSΨ, d∗
SΨ ∈D(QS), imply-
ing that QSΨ ∈D(QS). Hence, Ψ ∈D(Q2
S). Therefore, D(ΔS) ⊂D(Q2
S).
Thus, (7.49) follows. Since ΔS is self-adjoint by Theorem 7.2, we can apply
Lemma 7.13 to conclude that QS is self-adjoint.
(ii) This part follows from an application of Proposition 1.42 with the
case where S is replaced by QS and k = 1, ℓ= 2.
□
By combining Theorem 7.10 with Theorem 7.3, we obtain the following
result.
Corollary 7.4.
dΓ(S∗S, SS∗) = Q2
S.
(7.50)
Note that, for each p ≥
0, QS maps D(QS) ∩∧p(H , K ) into
∧p−1(H , K ) ⊕∧p+1(H , K ) (∧−1(H , K ) := {0}), and hence it does not
leave ∧p(H , K ) invariant. Therefore, operator equality (7.50) gives a non-
trivial factorization of the second quantization operator dΓ(S∗S, SS∗) for
(S∗S, SS∗).
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
479
By (7.4), we have the following orthogonal decomposition of the boson–
fermion Fock space F(H , K ):
F(H , K ) =

+(H , K ) ⊕

−(H , K ),
with

+(H , K ) :=
∞
 
p=0

2p(H , K ),

−(H , K ) :=
∞
 
p=0

2p+1(H , K ).
Let P± be the orthogonal projections onto 
±(H , K ) and
Γ := P+ −P−
(7.51)
Then, Γ is a bounded self-adjoint operator. Since
P+ + P−= I,
P+P−= P−P+ = 0,
it follows that
Γ 2 = I,
Γ ̸= ±I.
Hence, Γ is a unitary self-adjoint operator.
It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈F(H , K ),
(P+Ψ)(p) = 1 + (−1)p
2
Ψ (p),
(P−Ψ)(p) = 1 −(−1)p
2
Ψ (p),
p ≥0.
Hence,
(ΓΨ)(p) = (−1)pΨ (p),
p ≥0
(7.52)
Hence, in terms of the fermion number operator Nf, we have

(ii) The operator equality
ΓQSΓ −1 = −QS
(7.53)
holds.
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(QS)[= D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S)]. Then, by (7.52), ΓΨ ∈
D(dS) ∩D(d∗
S) = D(QS), implying that ΓD(QS) ⊂D(QS), and
(dSΓΨ)(p) = (−1)p−1dS,p−1Ψ (p−1) = (−1)p−1(dSΨ)(p),
(d∗
SΓΨ)(p) = (−1)p+1d∗
S,pΨ (p+1) = (−1)p+1(d∗
SΨ)(p).
Hence,
(QΓΨ)(p) = (−1)p−1(QSΨ)(p) = −(ΓQSΨ)(p).
Thus, QΓΨ = −ΓQSΨ.
(ii) Part (i) implies that ΓQS ⊂−QSΓ. Hence, ΓQSΓ −1 ⊂−QS. Since
both sides are self-adjoint, operator equality (7.53) follows.
□
One can derive from Theorem 7.11 important facts about the spectra
of QS.
We say that a subset Λ of R is symmetric with respect to the origin in
R if {−λ|λ ∈Λ} = Λ.
Theorem 7.12. Let σ#(QS) be one of σ(QS), σp(QS) and σc(QS). Then,
σ#(QS) is symmetric with respect to the origin in R.
Moreover, for each λ ∈σp(QS),
dim ker(QS −λ) = dim ker(QS + λ).
(7.54)
Proof. Equation (7.53) means that QS and −QS are unitarily equivalent.
Hence, σ#(QS) = σ#(−QS). By this fact and Problem 11 in Chapter 1, we
obtain
σ#(QS) = {−λ|λ ∈σ#(QS)}.
Thus, σ#(QS) is symmetric with respect to the origin in R.
Formula (7.54) follows from (7.53) and Theorem 1.9(ii).

Proof. In general, a densely deﬁned linear operator A from a Hilbert space
to a Hilbert space is closable if and only if D(A∗) is dense. We have (T ∗S)∗⊃

Abstract Dirac Operator
As one may have noted, the operator QS has very interesting properties.
In fact, there is an abstract structure behind QS. This section is devoted
to its description.
A Hilbert space H is said to be Z2-graded8 if it is the direct sum of
mutually orthogonal closed subspaces H± ̸= {0}:
H = H+ ⊕H−.
(7.57)
In this case, an element in H+ (resp., H−) is called an even (resp., odd)
element.
An everywhere deﬁned linear operator τ on H is called the grading
operator with respect to the orthogonal decomposition (7.57) if, for all
ψ± ∈H±, τψ± = ±ψ±. The operator τ is unique. Indeed, we have
τ = PH+ −PH −,
(7.58)
where PH± are the orthogonal projections onto H±. It follows that τ is a
bounded self-adjoint operator satisfying
τ2 = I,
τ ̸= ±I.
Hence, τ is a unitary self-adjoint operator.
We have
I = PH+ + PH −.
Hence,
PH+ = 1 + τ
2
,
PH−= 1 −τ
2
.
(7.59)
These are formulae used to express the orthogonal projections PH± in terms
of the grading operator τ.
In general, a bounded operator T on H is called an involution if
T 2 = I.
Let T be an involution on H . Then, it is easy to prove the following
facts:
(i) T is bijective.
(ii) If T is unitary, then T is self-adjoint.
8Z2 denotes the cyclic group of order 2.
484
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
An involution which is unitary is called a unitary involution.
The operators ±I on H are trivially unitary involutions. A unitary
involution diﬀerent from ±I is called a non-trivial unitary involution.
The above grading operator τ is a non-trivial unitary involution.
Lemma 7.15. Let T be a non-trivial unitary involution on H . Then,
σ(T ) = σp(T ) = {±1} and
H = ker(T −1) ⊕ker(T + 1).
(7.60)
Proof. By the assumption, T is a unitary self-adjoint operator such that
T ̸= ±I. Hence, σ(T ) = {±1} = σp(T ). Let ET be the spectral mea-
sure of T . Then, supp T = {±1}. Hence, I = ET (supp T ) = ET ({1}) +
ET ({−1}). Since RanET ({1}) = ker(T −1) and RanET ({−1}) = ker(T +1),
(7.60) holds.
□
This lemma shows that, given a non-trivial unitary involution T on H ,
H is Z2-graded, with T being its grading operator.
From the discussions above, we see that there exists a one-to-one corre-
spondence between a non-trivial unitary involution on H and a Z2-grading
of H .
We now come to the deﬁnition of an abstract Dirac operator.
Deﬁnition 7.1. Let τ be a non-trivial involution on H and Q be a sym-
metric operator on H . Then, Q is called a τ-Dirac operator, or a Dirac
operator, with respect to τ if τD(Q) ⊂D(Q) and
τQ + Qτ = 0
on D(Q).
The concept of τ-Dirac operator uniﬁes the concrete operators known
as Dirac-type operators. Examples of concrete Dirac-type operators can be
found, for example, in Thaller (1992) (see also problems in Section 7.21).
Here, we only note the following fact, which clariﬁes an essential structure
of QS and justiﬁes the name “Dirac operator” given to it.
Proposition 7.8. The operator Γ deﬁned by (7.51) is a non-trivial unitary
involution, and QS is a Γ-Dirac operator.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 7.11.

Abstract Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
The theory of a τ-Dirac operator may have concrete realizations in various
contexts in quantum physics. Among others, it presents an abstract frame-
work for supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM). SQM is a class
of quantum mechanics with supersymmetry, a symmetry which originates
in QFT, treating bosons and fermions on an equal footing in a suitable
sense. We mean by SQM not only SQM with ﬁnite degrees of freedom but
also SQM with inﬁnite degrees of freedom, including supersymmetric quan-
tum ﬁeld theory (SQFT). The simplest class of abstract SQM is deﬁned as
follows.
Deﬁnition 7.2. A quartet (H , γ, Q, H) consisting of a Hilbert space H ,
a non-trivial unitary involution γ and self-adjoint operators Q, H on H is
called a SQM if it has the following properties:
(SQM.1) H = Q2.
(SQM.2) γQ ⊂−Qγ.
The operators Q and H are called the supercharge and the supersym-
metric Hamiltonian, respectively. The operator γ is called the state-sign
operator.9
If ker Q ̸= {0}, then any non-zero vector in ker Q is called a supersym-
metric state. If ker Q = {0}, then supersymmetry is said to be sponta-
neously broken.
Remark 7.7. The notion of abstract SQM deﬁned above is very inclusive in
the sense that more quantum mechanical models may fall into the category
of SQM. For example, a system consisting of only fermions can be a concrete
realization of the abstract SQM (see Problems 10–12). Examples of SQM
with ﬁnite degrees of freedom can be found in Thaller (1992).
Remark 7.8. By (SQM.1), ker Q = ker H. Hence, a vector is a supersym-
metric state if and only if it is a zero-energy state of the supersymmetric
9In the physics literature, γ is often called the “fermion number operator” and written
as γ = (−1)F. But this is somewhat confusing because it is not the fermion number
operator on a fermion Fock space. In reality, γ accounts for the sign of a state of the
quantum system under consideration, i.e., for any bosonic state ψ+, γψ+ = ψ+ and, for
any fermionic state ψ−, γψ−= −ψ−. The name given here for γ is taken from these
reasons.
486
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hamiltonian H.10 (SQM.1) also implies that H is non-negative: H ≥0.
Hence, each zero-energy state of H is a ground state of H (see Section 4.8).
It is obvious that the supercharge Q in the above SQM is a γ-Dirac
operator. Hence, the theory of self-adjoint τ-Dirac operators includes the
theory of SQM. The reader should keep this fact in mind in what follows.
An important fact in the context of the theory of boson–fermion Fock
spaces is the following.
Theorem 7.14. For all S ∈C(H , K ), (F(H , K ), Γ, QS, dΓ(S∗S, SS∗))
is an SQM.
Proof. This follows from Corollary 7.4 and Theorem 7.11.
□
Remark 7.9. The SQM (F(H , K ), Γ, QS, dΓ(S∗S, SS∗)) and its pertur-
bations give an abstract uniﬁcation of concrete models in SQFT (Arai,
1989, 1992).
7.15
Fredholm Operators
We continue to study a τ-Dirac operator Q on the Z2-graded Hilbert space
H with the grading operator τ. We show that, if Q is self-adjoint, it has
an index which may be invariant under suitable deformations of it. But,
before doing that, we discuss some general aspects in operator theory.
Let X1 and X2 be Hilbert spaces and T ∈L(X1, X2) be a densely
deﬁned closed operator.
Deﬁnition 7.3. Let nul T = dim ker T and nul T ∗= dim ker T ∗be ﬁnite.
Then, one can deﬁne an integer ind T by
ind T := nul T −nul T ∗.
In the case where nul T < ∞(resp., ∞) and nul T ∗= ∞(resp., < ∞),
we set ind T := −∞(resp., ∞). The integer ind T is called the analytical
index of T , or, simply, the index of T .
Remark 7.10. If X1 = X2 and T is self-adjoint with nul T < ∞, then
ind T = 0, since nul T ∗= nul T . Hence, ind T can be non-trivial only if T
is not self-adjoint.
10In general, for a Hamiltonian H (a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space), an eigen-
vector ψ of H with eigenvalue 0 (i.e., Hψ = 0) is called a zero-energy state of H.
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
487
Since T is closed, we have T ∗∗= T . Hence,
ind T ∗= −ind T.
Suppose that nul T and nul T ∗are ﬁnite. Then, ind T is an integer.
Hence, one may expect that ind T is invariant under a “continuous” defor-
mation for T . Namely, if {T (t)|t ∈[0, 1]} is a family of densely deﬁned
closed operators from X1 to X2 such that T (0) = T and the mapping:
t →T (t) is continuous in a suitable topology, then it is expected that
ind T (t) = ind T , for all t ∈[0, 1]. If we introduce S(t) := T (t) −T , then
T (t) = T + S(t) on D(T ) ∩D(T (t)). Hence, the above deformation can be
viewed as a perturbation of T .
Remark 7.11. In general, to a linear operator A ∈L(X1, X2), one can
add another operator B ∈L(X1, X2) to form a new operator A + B ∈
L(X1, X2). In this case, B is called a perturbation of A, and A is called
the unperturbed operator. A basic theme of perturbation theory for
linear operators is to investigate what kind of properties of A are carried
over by A + B or not. If a property of A (e.g., closedness, self-adjointness,
and spectral property) is continued to hold by A + B, this property is said
to be stable under the perturbation B. For a systematic development of
perturbation theory for linear operators, see Kato (1976) and Reed and
Simon (1978), Chapter XII.
To state basic results on the stability of ind T under a perturbation for
T , we introduce a special class of closed operators as follows.
Deﬁnition 7.4. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be densely deﬁned and closed.
(i) The operator T is said to be Fredholm if Ran T is closed and nul T <
∞, nul T ∗< ∞.
(ii) The operator T is said to be semi-Fredholm if Ran T is closed and
at least one of nul T and nul T ∗is ﬁnite.
It is obvious from the deﬁnition that a Fredholm operator is semi-
Fredholm. For every Fredholm operator T , ind T is ﬁnite.
An important point of the closedness of the range of a closed operator,
which is part of the properties of a Fredholm operator, lies in the following
fact.
Proposition 7.9. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be closed. Then, Ran T is closed if
and only if there exists a constant C > 0 such that
∥T ψ∥≥C∥ψ∥,
ψ ∈(ker T )⊥∩D(T ).
(7.61)
488
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Suppose that Ran T is closed. Then, Ran T is a Hilbert space as a
closed subspace of X2. For each φ ∈Ran T , there exists a vector ψ ∈D(T )
such that T ψ = φ. By the closedness of T , ker T is a closed subspace. Hence,
we have the orthogonal decomposition ψ = ψ0 + ψ⊥
0 . with ψ0 ∈ker T and
ψ⊥
0 ∈(ker T )⊥. Hence, ψ⊥
0 ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥and φ = T ψ⊥
0 .
Let T ′ := T ↾[(ker T )⊥∩D(T )]. Then, T ′ is a bijective linear operator
from D(T )∩(ker T )⊥to Ran T and T ′−1φ = ψ⊥
0 . Hence, T ′−1 is a bijective
linear operator from Ran T to (ker T )⊥∩D(T ).
To prove the closedness of T ′−1 as an operator from Ran T to X1, let
φn ∈Ran T, φn →φ ∈Ran T and T ′−1φn →ψ ∈X1 (n →∞). Then,
letting ψn = T ′−1φn, we have ψn ∈D(T )∩(ker T )⊥and φn = T ′ψn = T ψn.
Since T is closed, it follows that ψ ∈D(T ) and T ψ = φ. For all η ∈ker T ,
⟨η, T ′−1φn⟩= 0. Hence, ⟨η, ψ⟩= limn→∞⟨η, T ′−1φn⟩= 0. Hence, ψ ∈
(ker T )⊥. Therefore, ψ = T ′−1φ. Thus, T ′−1 is closed.
It follows from the result just proved and the closed graph theorem
that T ′−1 is bounded. Namely, there exists a constant K > 0 such that
∥T ′−1φ∥≤K∥φ∥, φ ∈Ran T . For each ψ ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥, there exists a
vector φ ∈Ran T such that ψ = T ′−1φ. Hence, ∥ψ∥≤K∥T ′ψ∥= K∥T ψ∥.
Putting C = K−1, we obtain (7.61).
Suppose that (7.61) holds. and let {φn}n ⊂Ran T, φn →φ (n →∞).
Then, T ψn = φn. for some ψn ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥. Using (7.61), we see that
{ψn}n is a Cauchy sequence in X1. Hence, ψ := limn→∞ψn exists. By the
closedness of T , ψ ∈D(T ) and T ψ = φ. Hence, φ ∈Ran T . Thus, Ran T is
closed.
□
Proposition 7.9 implies an interesting fact.
Proposition 7.10. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be densely deﬁned and closed. Sup-
pose that Ran T is closed. Then, Ran T ∗is closed.
Proof. Suppose that Ran T ∗were not closed. Then, by Proposition 7.9,
there exists a sequence {φn}∞
n=1 ⊂D(T ∗) ∩(ker T ∗)⊥such that ∥φn∥= 1
and T ∗φn →0 (n →∞). By Theorem 1.10(ii), we have
X2 = ker T ∗⊕Ran T,
where we have used the fact that (T ∗)∗= T and the closedness of Ran T .
Hence, (ker T ∗)⊥= Ran T . Hence, φn ∈Ran T . Therefore, there exists a
vector ψn ∈D(T ) ∩(ker T )⊥such that φn = T ψn. Hence, ∥T ψn∥= 1 and
T ∗T ψn →0 (n →∞). By Proposition 7.9, there exists a constant C > 0
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
489
such that ∥T ψn∥≥C∥ψn∥. Hence, ∥ψn∥≤1/C. Hence, by the Schwarz
inequality,
∥φn∥2 = ∥T ψn∥2 ≤∥ψn∥∥T ∗T ψn∥≤∥T ∗T ψn∥/C →0 (n →∞).
Hence, ∥φn∥→0 (n →∞). But this contradicts the condition ∥φn∥= 1.
Thus, Ran T ∗is closed.
□
The following theorem shows the symmetry of (semi-)Fredholmness
under the conjugate operation T →T ∗.
Theorem 7.15. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be densely deﬁned and closed.
(i) If T is Fredholm, then so is T ∗.
(ii) If T is semi-Fredholm, then so is T ∗.
Proof. In both cases (i) and (ii), we need only to show that Ran T ∗is
closed. But this follows from Proposition 7.10.
□
A generalization of the concept of compact operator is given as follows.
Deﬁnition 7.5. Let X and Y be Banach spaces and S, T ∈L(X , Y ).
Then, S is said to be relatively compact with respect to T , or
T -compact, if D(T ) ⊂D(S) and, for every bounded sequence {ψn}∞
n=1
in D(T ) such that the sequence {T ψn}∞
n=1 is bounded, {Sψn}∞
n=1 contains
a convergent subsequence.
The following theorem is a basic fact about the stability of Fredholmness
and analytical index under a perturbation.
Theorem 7.16. Let T ∈L(X1, X2) be Fredholm (resp., semi-Fredholm)
and S ∈L(X1, X2) be a T -compact operator. Then, T + S is Fredholm
(resp., semi-Fredholm) and ind (T + S) = ind T .
Since the proof of this theorem requires lengthy arguments, we omit it.
For a proof of Theorem 7.16, see, for example, Kato (1976), Chapter IV,
Theorem 5.26.

Proof. Let ψ ∈D+(Q). Then, τψ = ψ. Hence, Qτψ = Qψ. The left-hand

ψ ∈D(Q).
Hence,
D+(Q) ⊕D−(Q) = D(Q).
Therefore, Qr = Q. By Lemma 7.16, for all ψ+ ∈D+(Q), (Qψ+)+ = 0,
i.e., Q++ = 0 on D+(Q). Similarly, Q−−= 0 on D−(Q). Hence, letting
Q−:= Q+−and Q+ := Q−+, we obtain (7.63).
In the present case, PH±D(Q) = D(Q±), as pointed above. Hence,
D(Q±) are dense in H±, respectively.
(i) By Theorem B.1(i) in Appendix B, we have
Q∗=


Q∗

Q∗


.
(7.64)
Since Q is symmetric, Q∗⊃Q. Hence, Q∗
+ ⊃Q−and Q∗
−⊃Q+.
(ii) Suppose that Q is closed. Let ψn ∈D(Q+) and ψn →ψ ∈H+,
Q+ψn →φ ∈H−(n →∞). Then, Qψn →φ (n →∞). Hence, ψ ∈D(Q)
and φ = Qψ. This means that ψ ∈D+(Q) = D(Q+) and Q+ψ = φ. Thus,
Q+ is closed. Similarly, one can show that Q−is closed.
Conversely, suppose that Q± are closed. Let ψn = (ψn+, ψn−) ∈D(Q)
be such that ψn →ψ ∈H and Qψn →φ ∈H (n →∞). Then, ψn± ∈
D(Q±) and
ψn± →ψ±, Q−ψn−→φ+, Q+ψn+ →φ−(n →∞).

Hence, ψ± ∈D(Q±) and Q±ψ± = φ∓. Therefore, ψ ∈D(Q) and Qψ = φ.
Thus, Q is closed.
□
With regard to Fredholmness of Q±, we have the following fact.
Lemma 7.18. The operator Q± are (semi-)Fredholm if and only if Q is
(semi-)Fredholm.
Proof. The equivalence on closedness between Q± and Q follows Lemma
7.17(ii). As is easily seen, we have
ker Q = ker Q+ ⊕ker Q−,
ker Q∗= ker Q∗
−⊕ker Q∗
+.
Hence, “nul Q < ∞, nul Q∗< ∞” is equivalent to “nul Q± < ∞, nul Q∗
± <
∞.” By direct computations, we have
∥Qψ∥2 = ∥Q+ψ+∥2 + ∥Q−ψ−∥2,
ψ = (ψ+, ψ−) ∈D(Q).
(7.65)
Now, suppose that Q is Fredholm. Then, Ran Q is closed and nul Q <
∞, nul Q∗< ∞. Hence, as remarked above, we have nul Q± < ∞and
nul Q∗
± < ∞. By the closedness of Ran Q and Proposition 7.9, there exists
a constant C > 0 such that
∥Qψ∥≥C∥ψ∥,
ψ ∈(ker Q)⊥∩D(Q).
By this estimate and (7.65), we obtain
∥Q±ψ±∥≥C∥ψ±∥,
ψ± ∈D(Q±) ∩(ker Q±)⊥.
By Proposition 7.9 again, this means that Ran Q± are closed. Thus, Q±
are Fredholm.
Next, suppose that Q± are Fredholm. Then, Ran Q± are closed and
nul Q± < ∞, nul Q∗
± < ∞. Hence, nul Q < ∞and nul Q∗< ∞. Moreover,
Ran Q = Ran Q−⊕Ran Q+, which implies that Ran Q is closed. Thus, Q
is Fredholm.
Similarly, we can prove the statement on semi-Fredholmness.
□
With regard to the relative compactness of a τ-Dirac operator with Q,
we have the following fact.
Lemma 7.19. Let V be a τ-Dirac operator. Then, V is Q-compact if and
only if Va is Qa-compact for a = ±.
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
493
Proof. Suppose that V is Q-compact. Let {ψn+}n ⊂D(Q+) be a bounded
sequence such that {Q+ψn+}n is bounded. Let ψn := (ψn+, 0). Then, ψn ∈
D(Q) and {ψn}n is bounded. Also, we have {Qψn}n = {(0, Q+ψn+)}n.
Hence, {Qψn}n is bounded. Therefore, by the Q-compactness of V , there
exists a subsequence {ψnk}k of {ψn}n such that {V ψnk}k converges. We
have V ψn = (0, V+ψn+). Hence, {V+ψnk}k converges. Thus, V+ is Q+-
compact.
Similarly, one can prove the Q−-compactness of V−.
Conversely, suppose that Va is Qa-compact for a = ±. Let {ψn}n ⊂
D(Q) be a bounded sequence such that {Qψn}n is bounded. Let ψn =
(ψn+, ψn−). Then, ψn± ∈D(Q±) and {ψn±}n are bounded. Also, we
have {Qψn}n = {(Qn−ψn−, Q+ψn+)}n. Hence, {Qψn±}n are bounded.
Therefore, by the Qa-compactness of Va (a = ±), there exists a subse-
quence {ψnk±}k of {ψn±}n such that {Vaψnka}k (a = ±) converges. Hence,
{V ψnk}k converges. Thus, V is Q-compact.

Self-Adjoint τ-Dirac Operators
In this section, we consider the case where the τ-Dirac operator Q is self-
adjoint.

operator from H+ to H−and
Q =

(7.66)
Proof. By the self-adjointness of Q and (7.64), we have Q∗

(7.66) holds.
□
Deﬁnition 7.6. Let Q be self-adjoint and suppose that at least one of
nul Q+ and nul Q∗
+ is ﬁnite. Then, we deﬁne indτ Q ∈Z ∪{±∞} by
indτ Q := ind Q+ = nul Q+ −nul Q∗
+.
We call indτ Q the τ-index of Q.
Remark 7.12. As is seen from the deﬁnition, the concept of τ-index indτ Q
is diﬀerent from that of the index ind Q. If Q is self-adjoint and nul Q < ∞,
then ind Q = 0 (Remark 7.10), but indτ Q is not necessarily zero.
494
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let us examine the stability of indτ Q under perturbations for Q. For
this purpose, we need two lemmas.
Lemma 7.21. Let T be a compact operator from a Hilbert space X1 to a
Hilbert space X2 and Sn ∈B(Y , X1), n ∈N (Y is a Hilbert space) such
that s- limn→∞S∗
n = 0. Then, limn→∞∥T Sn∥= 0.
Proof. We have ∥T Sn∥= ∥(T Sn)∗∥= ∥S∗
nT ∗∥. There exists a sequence
{φk}k in X2 such that ∥φk∥= 1, k ∈N and limk→∞∥S∗
nT ∗φk∥= ∥S∗
nT ∗∥.
Since T ∗is compact (which follows from the compactness of T ), there exists
a subsequence {φnℓ}ℓand a vector ψ ∈X1 such that limℓ→∞T ∗φnℓ= ψ.
Hence, ∥S∗
nψ∥= ∥S∗
nT ∗∥. But, under the present assumption, ∥S∗
nψ∥→0
(n →∞). Thus, limn→∞∥S∗
nT ∗∥= 0.
□
The following lemma shows the stability of the self-adjointness of an
operator under relatively compact perturbations.
Lemma 7.22. Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space X and
B be a A-compact symmetric operator on X . Then, B is inﬁnitesimally
small with respect to A. In particular, A + B is self-adjoint.
Proof. Let {ψn}n be a bounded sequence in X and φn := (A −z)−1ψn
(z ∈C \ R). Then, φn ∈D(A) and ∥φn∥≤|Im z|−1∥ψn∥and
∥Aφn∥= ∥ψn + z(A −z)−1ψn∥≤∥ψn∥+ |z| |Im z|−1∥ψn∥.
Hence, {φn}n and {Aφn}n are bounded. Therefore, by the A-compactness of
B, {Bφn}n contains a convergent subsequence. Since Bφn = B(A−z)−1ψn,
it follows that B(A −z)−1 is compact.
For each n ∈N, we can write B(A−in)−1 = T Sn, with T := B(A−i)−1
and Sn := (A −i)(A −in)−1. By the preceding result, T is compact. By
the functional calculus, Sn is bounded and S∗
n = (A + i)(A + in)−1. Using
the spectral representation for S∗
n, one can show that s- limn→∞S∗
n = 0.
Hence, by Lemma 7.21, ∥T Sn∥→0 (n →∞). Hence, This means that,
for every ε > 0, there exists an n0(ε) ∈N such that, for all n ≥n0(ε),
∥B(A −in)−1∥< ε. Hence, for all ψ ∈D(A),
∥Bψ∥≤ε∥(A −in0(ε))ψ∥≤ε∥Aψ∥+ bε∥ψ∥,
where bε := εn0(ε). Hence, B is inﬁnitesimally small with respect to A.
Therefore, according to the Kato–Rellich theorem (Theorem 1.17), A + B
is self-adjoint.
□
Boson–Fermion Fock Spaces and Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dirac-Type Operators
495
Now, we can prove a basic stability theorem for the τ-index of a self-
adjoint τ-Dirac operator.
Theorem 7.17. Let Q be a self-adjoint τ-Dirac operator and Fredholm
(resp., semi-Fredholm). Suppose that V is a τ-Dirac operator which is
Q-compact. Then, Q+V is a self-adjoint τ-Dirac operator, with D(Q+V ) =
D(Q) and Fredholm (resp., semi-Fredholm). Moreover,
indτ (Q + V ) = indτ Q.
(7.67)
Proof. Let Q be Fredholm (resp., semi-Fredholm). The self-adjointness of
Q + V follows from an application of Lemma 7.22. It is easy to see that
Q + V is a τ-Dirac operator. Applying Theorem 7.16, we see that Q + V is
Fredholm (resp., semi-Fredholm). Hence, by Lemma 7.18, (Q+V )+ = Q++
V+ is Fredholm (resp., semi-Fredholm). By Lemma 7.19, V+ is Q+-compact.
Hence, by Theorem 7.16 again, ind (Q + V )+ = ind Q+. Thus, (7.67)
holds.
□
7.18
Index Formula
In this section, we derive a general formula for the τ-index of a self-adjoint
τ-Dirac operator. For this purpose, we ﬁrst present some lemmas.
Lemma 7.23. Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator from a Hilbert
space X to a Hilbert space Y . Suppose that σp(T ∗T ) \ {0} ̸= ∅and E ∈
σp(T ∗T ) \ {0} (hence E > 0). Then, there exists a unitary operator UE :
ker(T ∗T −E) →ker(T T ∗−E) such that
UEψ =
1
√
E
T ψ,
ψ ∈ker(T ∗T −E).
(7.68)
In particular,
dim ker(T ∗T −E) = dim ker(T T ∗−E),
E ∈σp(T ∗T ) \ {0}
(7.69)
and
σp(T ∗T ) \ {0} = σp(T T ∗) \ {0}.
(7.70)
Proof. Let UE : ker(T ∗T −E) →X be deﬁned by (7.68). Then, for all
ψ ∈ker(T ∗T −E), UEψ ∈D(T ∗) and T ∗UEψ =
√
Eψ. Hence, T ∗UEψ ∈
496
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
D(T ) and T T ∗UEψ =
√
ET ψ = EUEψ. Hence, UEψ ∈ker(T T ∗−E). Using
T ∗T ψ = Eψ, we have
∥UEψ∥2 = ⟨T ψ, T ψ⟩
E
= ⟨ψ, T ∗T ψ⟩
E
= ∥ψ∥2.
Hence, UE preserves the inner product.
For each φ ∈ker(T T ∗−E), the vector ψ := T ∗φ/
√
E is in D(T )
and T ψ =
√
Eφ · · · (∗). Hence, T ψ ∈D(T ∗) and T ∗T ψ = Eψ, i.e.,
ψ ∈ker(T ∗T −E). By this fact and (∗), we obtain φ = UEψ. Hence,
Ran(UE) = ker(T T ∗−E). Thus, UE is a unitary operator from ker(T ∗T −E)
to ker(T T ∗−E). This implies (7.69) and (7.70).

Lemma 7.24. Let T be a densely deﬁned closed operator from a Hilbert

Proof. Let T = U|T | be the polar decomposition13 of T so that D(T ) =
D(|T |) and U : (ker T )⊥→Ran T is a partial isometry, with ker |T | = ker T .
Let δ := inf σ(|T |) \ {0} and E|T | be the spectral measure of |T |. Then, for

We recall some basic properties of a trace class operator (Section 1.3.9).
Lemma 7.25. Let T be a trace class on a Hilbert space X . Then, T is
compact and ∞
n=1 λn < ∞, where λn’s are the singular values of T (i.e.,
the eigenvalues of |T |).
Proof. A proof of this lemma can be found in textbooks on Hilbert space

(1980), Theorem VI.21.
□
Let Aj (j = 1, 2) be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space Hj and
A := A1 ⊕A2 be the direct sum of A1 and A2 on H1 ⊕H2. Then, by
Theorem 4.2(vi), A is self-adjoint.
Lemma 7.26. Let A1, A2 and A be as above and Ej be the spectral measure
of Aj (j = 1, 2). Then:
(i) For each Borel set J ⊂R, the operator (E1 ⊕E2)(J) on H1 ⊕H2,
deﬁned by
(E1 ⊕E2)(J) := E1(J) ⊕E2(J),
is an orthogonal projection and (E1 ⊕E2)(·) is the spectral measure
of A.
(ii) For all Borel-measurable function f on R,
f(A) = f(A1) ⊕f(A2).
Proof. It follows from the deﬁnition of A that A is reduced by each Hj
and the reduced part of A to Hj is equal to Aj. Hence, part (i) follows from
an application of Theorem 1.47(ix). Part (ii) is due to Theorem 1.49.

We now come to the main theorem in this section.
Theorem 7.18. Let Q be a self-adjoint τ-Dirac operator on a Hilbert
space H . Suppose that, for some t > 0, e−tQ2 is a trace class. Then, Q is
Fredholm and
indτ (Q) = Tr τe−tQ2,
(7.72)
independently of t.

By this equation and the present assumption, e−tQ∗
+Q+ and e−tQ+Q∗

trace class and non-negative self-adjoint. Since a trace class operator is com-
pact by Lemma 7.25, σ(e−tQ∗
+Q+)\{0} consists of only discrete eigenvalues
(Lemma 1.2). According to the spectral mapping theorem, σ(Q∗
+Q+) \ {0}
consists of only discrete eigenvalues. Let σ(Q∗
+Q+) \ {0} = {En}∞
n=1, with
0 < E1 < E2 < · · · and mn being the multiplicity of the eigenvalue En.
Then, by Lemma 7.23,
σ(Q+Q∗

n=1,
with dim ker(Q+Q∗
+ −En) = mn.
If ker Q∗
+Q+ ̸= {0}, then e−t·0 = 1 is an eigenvalue of e−tQ∗
+Q+ which
has a ﬁnite multiplicity. Hence, dim ker Q∗
+Q+ < ∞. Hence, nul Q+ < ∞.
Similarly, one can show that nul Q∗
+ < ∞.
Equation (7.73) means that |Q|2
= |Q+|2 ⊕|Q∗
+|2. Hence, using
functional
calculus
for
the
direct
sums

σ(|Q|) \ {0} = {

implying that inf σ(|Q|) \ {0} = √E1 > 0. Hence, by Lemma 7.24, RanQ is

Thus, (7.72) holds.
□
Remark 7.14. If, for some t > 0, e−tQ2 is trace class, then, for all s > t,
e−sQ2 is trace class. This is proved as follows: using functional calculus, one
has e−sQ2 = Se−tQ2, with S := e−(s−t)Q2. Since S is bounded, it follows
from Proposition 1.24 that Se−tQ2 is trace class.

Fredholmness and the Γ -Index of the Dirac
Operator QS
We now return to the boson–fermion Fock space F(H , K ). As we have
seen, the operator QS introduced in Section 7.11 is a self-adjoint Γ-Dirac
operator. Hence, it is natural to ask if it is Fredholm and what the Γ-index
of QS is like. We have the following results.
Theorem 7.19.
(i) If S is Fredholm and nul S = 0, then QS is Fredholm and
indΓ QS = δ0,nul S∗.
(7.74)
(ii) If S is semi-Fredholm with nul S ≥1 and nul S∗= 0, then QS is
semi-Fredholm and
indΓ QS = ∞.
(7.75)
(iii) If nul S = 0 and nul S∗= ∞, then QS is not semi-Fredholm.
(iv) If nul S ≥1 and nul S∗≥1, then QS is not semi-Fredholm.
To prove this theorem, we present a lemma.
Lemma 7.27. The range Ran(S) is closed if and only
inf σ(S∗S) \ {0} > 0.
(7.76)
Proof. Suppose that Ran(S) is closed. Then, by Proposition 7.9, there
exists a constant C > 0 such that, for all ψ ∈D(S) ∩(ker S)⊥, ∥Sψ∥≥
C∥ψ∥. We have ker S∗S = ker S and hence (ker S)⊥= (ker S∗S)⊥. Hence,
for all ψ ∈D(S∗S) ∩(ker S∗S)⊥, C2∥ψ∥2 ≤∥Sψ∥2 = ⟨ψ, S∗Sψ⟩. This
means that σ(S∗S) \ {0} ⊂[C2, ∞). Hence, (7.76) holds.
500
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Conversely, assume (7.76), and let c := inf σ(S∗S) \ {0}. Then, using
the fact that |S|2 = S∗S and the spectral mapping theorem, σ(|S|) \ {0} ⊂
[√c, ∞). It follows from functional calculus and ∥Sψ∥= ∥|S| ψ∥, ψ ∈
D(S) = D(|S|) that ∥Sψ∥≥√c∥ψ∥, ψ ∈D(S)∩(ker S)⊥. Hence, by Propo-
sition 7.9, Ran(S) is closed.

S,+ = ⊕∞
p=0ΔS,2p+1.
Hence,
ker QS,+ = ⊕∞
p=0 ker ΔS,2p,

(i) Let S be Fredholm with nul S = 0. Then, n := nul S∗< ∞. We ﬁrst
prove (7.74) according to the value of n.
(a) The case n = 0
In this case, by Theorem 7.9 and (7.77), we have nul QS,+ = 1 and
nul Q∗
S,+ = 0. Hence, indΓ QS = 1.

(b) The case n ≥1
By Theorem 7.9 and (7.77), we have
nul QS,+ =

2p≤n
nC2p < ∞,
nul Q∗

Hence,
indΓ QS =


p=0
nCp(−1)p = (1 + (−1))n = 0.
Thus, (7.74) holds.
We next prove the Fredholmness of QS. By the Fredholmness of S,
Ran S is closed. Hence, by Lemma 7.27,
δ1 := inf σ(S∗S) \ {0} > 0.
Since S∗also is Fredholm, we have, similarly,
δ2 := inf σ(SS∗) \ {0} > 0.
Let δ := min{δ1, δ2} > 0. Then, by the spectral property of second quanti-
zation operators,
inf σ(ΔS,p) \ {0} ≥δ > 0,
p ≥0.
Hence,
inf σ(Q∗
S,+QS,+) \ {0} ≥δ > 0,
inf σ(QS,+Q∗
S,+) \ {0} ≥δ > 0.
Hence, by Lemma 7.27, Ran(QS,+) and Ran(Q∗
S,+) are closed. Therefore,
QS,+ is Fredholm. Thus, by Lemma 7.18, QS is Fredholm.
(ii) Let S be semi-Fredholm with nul S ≥1 and nul S∗= 0. Then, by
Theorem 7.8, for all p ≥1, ker ΔS,p = {0}. Hence, nul QS,+ = nul ΔS,0,
nul Q∗
S,+ = 0. By Theorem 7.9, nul ΔS,0 = ∞. Thus, (7.75) holds.
The semi-Fredholmness of QS can be proved in the same way as in (i).
(iii) Let nul S = 0 and nul S∗= ∞. Then, by the proof in (i), nul QS,+ =
∞and nul Q∗
S,+ = ∞. Hence, QS,+ is not semi-Fredholm. Thus, QS is not
semi-Fredholm.
(iv) Let nul S ≥1 and nul S∗≥1. Then, in the same way as in the
poof of (iii), we have nul QS,+ = ∞and nul Q∗
S,+ = ∞. Hence, QS,+ is not
semi-Fredholm. Thus, QS is not semi-Fredholm.

Notes
The main contents of this chapter are taken from the work of Arai (1989,
1992). In these articles, a class of perturbations V for the Dirac operator,
QS such that QS(V ) := QS + V is essentially self-adjoint, is considered
(V is not necessarily relatively compact with respect to QS), and a func-
tional integral representation for the index indΓ QS(V ) is established. A
study on the essential self-adjointness of QS(V ) is conducted by Arai (1994).
It is shown by Arai (1992) that the SQM (F(H , K ), Γ, QS(V ), H), with
H := QS(V )
2, gives a uniﬁcation of some models in SQFT For an example
of recent work on QS(V ), see Arai (2014a). In Arai (2022), mathematical
descriptions of some concrete supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld models are
given.

with test vector z ∈C. Set a := A(1) and b := B(1).

Chapter 8
General Theory
of Quantum Fields
Mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds is described in a general framework.
8.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we describe a mathematical theory of quantum ﬁelds. As
mentioned in the preface of this book, there are two approaches to study-
ing the quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) mathematically, namely, the axiomatic
approach and the constructive approach. In this chapter, we begin with a
brief introduction to axiomatic QFT. However, with regard to axiomatic
QFT, we restrict ourselves to focusing on the essential aspects that a begin-
ner in mathematical QFT should know since this book is mainly intended
to provide a mathematical base for a constructive approach in QFT.
A standard heuristic approach to obtaining a notion of quantum ﬁeld
is to apply the “canonical quantization” scheme to a classical ﬁeld, as is
usually done in textbooks on QFT in physics. This scheme is called the
canonical formalism in QFT. From the viewpoint which regards QFT as a
fundamental theory in physics, however, the concept of a quantum ﬁeld (if it
exists) should be considered independent of classical ﬁelds. In the framework
of such a QFT, a classical ﬁeld should be positioned as a classical limit of
a quantum ﬁeld, where the reduced Planck constant (the Dirac constant)
ℏtends to 0 in a suitable sense. The purpose of this chapter is to deﬁne
a general concept of quantum ﬁeld in the sense just mentioned and to
investigate its basic properties.

8.2
Operator-Valued Distributions
8.2.1
Operator-valued functions
Let F be a Hilbert space and L(F) be the space of linear operators on F
(see Section 1.1.1).
A mapping A : Rd →L(F); Rd ∋x →A(x) ∈L(F) is called an
operator-valued function on Rd with values in L(F).
Example 8.1. Let fj : Rd →C (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N) and Aj ∈L(F).
Then, A : Rd →L(F), deﬁned by A(x) := n
j=1 fj(x)Aj, x ∈Rd, is an
operator-valued function on Rd.
Example 8.2. Let (A1, . . . , Ad) be a d-tuple of self-adjoint operators on F.
Then, U : Rd →B(F) (the Banach space of bounded linear operators
on F), deﬁned by U(x) = eix1A1 · · · eixdAd, x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈Rd, is an
operator-valued function on Rd. Note that, for all x ∈Rd, U(x) is unitary.
8.2.2
Operator-valued distributions
We can also deﬁne an operator-valued functional as an extension of the
concept of operator-valued function. Let V be a complex vector space.
Then, a mapping φ : V →L(F);V ∋v →φ(v) ∈L(F) is called an
operator-valued functional on V with values in L(F).
We denote by S (Rd) the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions
on Rd (see Appendix D).
Example 8.3. Let A : Rd →L(F) be an operator-valued function such
that, for all x ∈Rd, A(x) ∈B(F) and A is Borel measurable, with

Rd |f(x)| ∥A(x)Ψ∥dx < ∞,
f ∈S (Rd), Ψ ∈F.
For each f ∈S (Rd), one can deﬁne a linear operator φA(f) on F as
follows:
D(φA(f)) :=

Ψ ∈F|

Rd |f(x)| ∥A(x)Ψ∥dx < ∞

,
φA(f)Ψ :=

Rd f(x)A(x)Ψdx,
Ψ ∈D(φA(f)),
where the integral on the right-hand side is taken in the sense of Bochner
integral (see Appendix E). The mapping φA : f →φA(f) is an operator-
valued functional on S (Rd) with values in L(F).
General Theory of Quantum Fields
515
In analogy with the case of usual functions and distributions (see
Appendix D), the concept of operator-valued functions can be extended
to the concept of operator-valued distributions.
Deﬁnition 8.1. Let d ∈N and D be a dense subspace in F. A mapping
ϕ : S (Rd) →L(F); S (Rd) ∋f →ϕ(f) ∈L(F) is called an operator-
valued distribution on Rd with values in L(F) if the following (ϕ.1)–
(ϕ.3) hold:
(ϕ.1) For all f ∈S (Rd), ϕ(f) is densely deﬁned with D ⊂D(ϕ(f)) ∩
D(ϕ(f)∗).
(ϕ.2) (linearity in test functions) For all f, g ∈S (Rd) and α, β ∈C,
ϕ(αf + βg) = αϕ(f) + βϕ(g)
on D.
(ϕ.3) (continuity) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D, the correspondence S (Rd) ∋f →
⟨Ψ, ϕ(f)Φ⟩is continuous in S (Rd). Namely, the linear functional
FΨ,Φ : S (Rd) →C, deﬁned by FΨ,Φ(f) := ⟨Ψ, ϕ(f)Φ⟩, f ∈S (Rd), is
a tempered distribution on Rd: FΨ,Φ ∈S ′(Rd).
The subspace D is called a common domain of ϕ.
We denote by S ′(Rd, L(F)) the set of operator-valued distribu-
tions on Rd with values in L(F).
Remark 8.1. In Deﬁnition 8.1, one can replace S (Rd) by D(Rd), the space
of test functions with compact support (see Appendix D). In this case,
FΨ,Φ ∈D′(Rd). However, in this book, we consider only operator-valued
distributions in the above sense.
Remark 8.2. By condition (ϕ.1), D(ϕ(f)∗) is dense. Hence, ϕ(f) is
closable.
As in the case of usual distributions, for an operator-valued distribution
ϕ as well, a ﬁctitious symbol ϕ(x) is sometimes used in the form
ϕ(f) =

Rd ϕ(x)f(x)dx.
The symbol ϕ(x) is called the operator-valued distribution kernel of ϕ.
In reference to this form, one says symbolically that ϕ(f) is obtained by
“smearing” ϕ(x) with f.1
1Strictly, this expression can have a real mathematical meaning only if ϕ(x) is an
operator-valued function on Rd with suitable properties.
516
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let ϕ1 and ϕ2 be in S ′(Rd, L(F)) with common domains D1 and D2,
respectively, and D be a subspace of F such that D ⊂D1 ∩D2. Then, we
say that ϕ1 is equal to ϕ2 on D if, for all Ψ ∈D and f ∈S (Rd), ϕ1(f)Ψ =
ϕ2(f)Ψ. In this case, we write “ϕ1 = ϕ2 on D,” or “ϕ1(x) = ϕ2(x) on D,
in the sense of operator-valued distribution.”
Example 8.4. Let S1, . . . , Sn (n ∈N) be densely deﬁned closed operators
on F and φ1, . . . , φn ∈S ′(Rd). Suppose that there exists a dense subspace
D such that D ⊂∩n
j=1D(Sj) ∩D(S∗
j ). Then, the mapping ϕ : S (Rd) →
L(F), deﬁned by
ϕ(f) :=
n

j=1
φj(f)Sj,
f ∈S (Rd),
is in S ′(Rd, L(F)).
Note that, if n = 1 and S1 = I (identity), then ϕ(f) = φ1(f) (a scalar
multiplication operator). Hence, each element in S ′(Rd) can be regarded
as a special case of operator-valued distributions on Rd.
Example 8.5. Let us consider the case where F = Fb(L2(Rd)), the boson
Fock space over L2(Rd) (see Chapter 5). We denote by a(f) the boson
annihilation operator on Fb(L2(Rd)) with test vector f ∈L2(Rd). Let Nb
be the boson number operator on Fb(L2(Rd)). Then, as we have seen in

Hence, if fn

tion on Rd. Thus, the mapping : f →a(f ∗) is an operator-valued distribu-
tion on Rd, with values in L(Fb(L2(Rd))) and D(N 1/2
b
) being a common
domain of this operator-valued distribution.
Similarly, one can show that the mapping f →a(f)∗(the boson creation
operator with test vector f ∈S (Rd)) is in S ′(Rd, Fb(L2(Rd)) with a
common domain D(N 1/2
b
).
8.2.3
Transformations of operator-valued distributions
Let ϕ ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)) with a common domain D and T be a continuous
linear mapping on S (Rd). Then, one can deﬁne a mapping ϕT : S (Rd) →
L(F) by
ϕT (f) := ϕ(T f),
f ∈S (Rd).
(8.3)
Then, it is easy to see that ϕT
∈
S ′(Rd, L(F)). We call ϕT
the
T -transform of ϕ. If there exists a unitary operator U on F such that
Uϕ(f)U −1 = ϕT (f) = ϕ(T f),
f ∈S (Rd),
then ϕT is unitarily implementable by U.
One can also consider the case where T is a continuous anti-linear map-
ping on S (Rd). In this case too, ϕT (f) is deﬁned by (8.3). But, in this case,
by the anti-linearity of T , the mapping f →ϕT (f)∗is an operator-valued
distribution on Rd. If there exists an anti-unitary operator2 U ′ on F such
that
U ′ϕ(f)U ′−1 = ϕ(T f),
f ∈S (Rd),
then ϕT is anti-unitarily implementable by U ′.

Partial derivatives of operator-valued distributions
Let ϕ ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)) with a common domain D. Then, for each multi-
index α ∈Zd
+, one can deﬁne a mapping Dαϕ : S (Rd) →L(F) by
(Dαϕ)(f) = (−1)|α|ϕ(∂αf),
f ∈S (Rd).
Then, as in the case of usual distributions (see Section D.1.4 in
Appendix D), one can see that Dαϕ ∈S ′(Rd, L(F)), with D being a
common domain. We call the operator-valued distribution Dαϕ a partial
derivative of ϕ of order |α|.
For a non-negative integer αj (j = 1, . . . , d), we write
Dαj
j
:= Dα
with α = (0, . . . , 0,

General Concept of Quantum Field
8.3.1
Time-translation covariant quantum ﬁeld theory
We consider a quantum system in the d-dimensional space Rd with d ∈N.
In the usual physical sense, the space dimension d is taken to be 3. But
we do not restrict ourselves to this case for the following reasons: (1) for
mathematical generality; (2) to clarify the dependence of theories on the
space dimension d and to know what are the essential diﬀerences in theories
with d = 3 from those with d ̸= 3. This may bring us insights about the
“meaning” of d = 3.
The space-time is given by
R1+d := R × Rd = {(x0, x)|x0 ∈R, x ∈Rd}
= {(x0, x1, . . . , xd)|xμ ∈R, μ = 0, . . . , d},
where xμ (μ = 0, 1, . . ., d) denotes the μth coordinate of the point x ∈R1+d,
in particular, x0 and x = (x1, . . . , xd) are the time coordinate and the space
component of x, respectively.3
3We take the upper index notation xμ (μ = 0, 1, . . . , d), which is convenient in rela-
tivistic QFT discussed later.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
519
The vector space R1+d has many metrics.4 But, for the time being,
we proceed without specifying a metric of R1+d, treating R1+d only as a
topological space with the standard topology.5 This approach will clarify
the aspects of QFT independent of the metrics of R1+d.
In general, in the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, which
is due to von Neumann, a state of a quantum system is described by a
non-zero vector in a Hilbert space H and a physical quantity is given by
a self-adjoint operator on H . Among others, the self-adjoint operator H
which describes the total energy of a quantum system is called the Hamil-
tonian of the system. According to an axiom of quantum mechanics, the
strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group {e−itH/ℏ}t∈R governs the
time development of the quantum system in the way that, for any state vec-
tor Ψ ∈H at time 0, the state vector at time t ∈R is given by e−itH/ℏΨ,
provided that no measurement is made on the quantum system in the time
interval [0, t].
As suggested by heuristic arguments made in textbooks on QFT in
physics, a quantum ﬁeld may be an object which has the function that cre-
ates or annihilates elementary particles in the space-time. A priori, a quan-
tum ﬁeld itself may not be necessarily a physical quantity, but it should be
a linear operator acting in a Hilbert space of quantum states and related
to other physical quantities in a harmonious way with laws. Thus, it is sug-
gested that a general concept of a quantum ﬁeld may not be deﬁned without
reference to other physical quantities. We ﬁrst deﬁne a class of QFT with
a Hamiltonian.
For a function f on R1+d and a = (a0, a) ∈R1+d, we deﬁne the function
fa on R1+d by
fa(x) := f(x −a) = f(x0 −a0, x −a),
x = (x0, x) ∈R1+d.
(8.4)
The function fa is called the space-time translation (or simply trans-
lation) of f by the vector a. In particular, for each time t ∈R, f(t,0) is
4Let V be a real vector space. A metric of V is a bilinear form g : V ×V →R satisfying
the following (i) and (ii): (i) (non-degeneracy) if a vector u ∈V satisﬁes g(u, v) = 0 for
all v ∈V , then u = 0; (ii) (symmetry) g(u, v) = g(v, u) for all u, v ∈V . In one word, g is
a non-degenerate symmetric covariant tensor of degree 2 on V . A metric g of V is said
to be positive (resp., negative) deﬁnite if g(u, u) ≥0 (resp., g(u, u) ≤0), for all u. In
both cases, one can show that g(u, u) = 0 if and only if u = 0. Hence, a metric g of V is
an inner product of V if and only if g is positive deﬁnite. On the other hand, g is said
to be indeﬁnite if there exist points u, v ∈V such that g(u, u) > 0 and g(v, v) < 0.
5It is important to distinguish the concept of metric from that of topology. In the
physics literature, confusions are sometimes seen on this aspect.
520
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
called the time-translation of f by t, and f(0,a) with a ∈Rd is called the
space-translation of f by a.
It is easy to see that, for all f ∈S (R1+d), fa ∈S (R1+d) (Problem
8.17).
Deﬁnition 8.2. A time-translation covariant QFT on the space-time
R1+d is a quartet (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) (s ∈N) consisting of a Hilbert space
F, a dense subspace D ⊂F, a self-adjoint operator H on F and an s-tuple
(ϕr)s
r=1 with ϕr ∈S ′(R1+d, L(F)) (r = 1, . . . , s) such that the following
(QF.1) and (QF.2) hold:
(QF.1) For all f ∈S (R1+d), ϕr(f) and ϕr(f)∗leave D invariant:
ϕr(f)D ⊂D,
ϕr(f)∗D ⊂D.
(QF.2) (time-translation covariance) For all t ∈R and f ∈S (R1+d),
ϕr(f(t,0)) = eitH/ℏϕr(f)e−itH/ℏ
on D (r = 1, . . . , s).
(8.5)
The
s-tuple
(ϕr)s
r=1
of
operator-valued
distributions
is
called
an
s-component quantum ﬁeld and H is called the Hamiltonian. Also,
each component ϕr is called a quantum ﬁeld.
Remark 8.3. (1) Deﬁnition 8.2 is a general deﬁnition of a QFT, noting
only the basic relation (8.5) between quantum ﬁelds and the Hamiltonian.
It is independent of whether or not the theory considered is relativistic in
the sense of Einstein’s special theory of relativity.
As is well known, a classical scalar ﬁeld is a function on the space-
time. Hence, it would be natural to ask why a quantum ﬁeld is deﬁned as
an operator-valued distribution, not as an operator-valued function on the
space-time. One of the reasons comes from taking the canonical formalism
into account, which is a heuristic scheme to formulate a QFT from a classi-
cal ﬁeld theory, as mentioned in Section 8.1. In this formalism, for a classical
scalar ﬁeld ϕcl(x) and its canonical conjugate πcl(x) (x ∈R1+d), a quantum
ﬁeld ϕ(x) and its canonical conjugate π(x) are supposed to exist as alge-
braic elements satisfying the equal-time canonical commutation relations of
Heisenberg:
[ϕ(t, x), π(t, y)] = iℏδ(x −y),
[ϕ(t, x), ϕ(t, y)] = 0,
[π(t, x), π(t, y)] = 0,
(t, x), (t, y) ∈R1+d,
General Theory of Quantum Fields
521
where δ(x −y) is the diagonal delta distribution on R2d (see Section
D.3.3 in Appendix D). However, since δ(x −y) is not a function, it is
not expected that the mapping (t, x) →ϕ(t, x) (resp., π(t, x)) is an
operator-valued function.6 Hence, it may be legitimate to deﬁne a quan-
tum ﬁeld as the smeared one: “ϕ(t, g) =

Rd ϕ(t, x)g(x)dx” (g ∈S (Rd))
or “ϕ(f) =

R1+d ϕ(x)f(x)dx” (f ∈S (R1+d)). Then, the above equal-time
canonical commutation relations are replaced as follows:
[ϕ(t, g), π(t, h)] = iℏ

Rd g(x)h(x)dx,
[ϕ(t, g), ϕ(t, h)] = 0,
[π(t, g), π(t, h)] = 0, t ∈R, g, h ∈S (Rd).
As we shall see later (Section 8.3.3), there are cases where the object ϕ(t, g)
is mathematically meaningful.
There is another reason to deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld as an operator-valued
distribution. From a quantum mechanical point of view, the physical notion
of one point in the space-time may be meaningless.7 It may be natural
to suppose that the strength of a quantum ﬁeld is measured in a ﬁnite
region in the space-time which may be variable, not at one point in the
space-time. The operator-value ϕ(f) of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ as an operator-
valued distribution corresponds to such a measurement in a space-time
region which includes the support of f.
In addition, there is an surprising theorem that, in a framework of rel-
ativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, a non-trivial (non-constant) quantum ﬁeld
cannot be an operator-valued function on the space-time (Wightman’s
theorem8).
(2) A physical picture contained in Deﬁnition 8.2 is as follows. Since
f(t,0) physically means the time translation of f by t, as mentioned above,
ϕr(f(t,0)) is interpreted as the time translation of the quantum ﬁeld ϕr by t.
Property (QF.2) shows that the time-translated quantum ﬁeld ϕr(f(t,0)) is
unitarily implementable on D with the unitary operator e−itH/ℏ, which
6Suppose that ϕ(·) and π(·) are operator-valued functions on R1+d. Then, by analogy
with classical ﬁelds, it would be natural to assume that there exists a subspace D such
that D ⊂∩x,y∈R1+dD(ϕ(x)π(y)) ∩D(π(y)ϕ(x)) and, for all Ψ, Φ ∈D, the function
R1+d × R1+d ∋(x, y) 	→⟨Ψ, ϕ(x)π(y)Φ⟩(resp., ⟨Ψ, π(y)ϕ(x)Φ⟩) is continuous. But, in
that case, the equation ⟨Ψ, [ϕ(t, x), π(t, y)]Φ⟩= iℏδ(x −y) ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩is contradictory since
the left-hand side is continuous in (t, x, y).
7Recall that the probability of ﬁnding a quantum particle at one point in the space is
theoretically zero.
8See, for example, Bogoliubov et al. (1975), Section 2.4.
522
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
governs the time development of states of the quantum system under con-
sideration. This property is called the unitary covariance of the quantum
ﬁeld (ϕr)s
r=1 with respect to time, or simply the time-translation covari-
ance of (ϕr)s
r=1.
The operator eitH/ℏϕr(f)e−itH/ℏis the Heisenberg operator of ϕr(f)
with respect to the Hamiltonian H (see Section 5.17), which describes the
quantum ﬁeld at time t. Hence, (8.5) means that the time-translated quan-
tum ﬁeld ϕr(f(t,0)) coincides with the Heisenberg operator of ϕr(f) on D.
This is a harmonious relation. Equation (8.5) is symbolically written in
terms of distribution kernels as follows:
ϕr(x0 + t, x) = eitH/ℏϕr(x0, x)e−itH/ℏ
on D.
(3) Let U(t) := e−itH/ℏ, t ∈R. Then, the mapping U : t →U(t) is a
strongly continuous unitary representation of R (as a translation group) on
F (see Section 2.9.2), satisfying
ϕr(f(t,0)) = U(t)∗ϕr(f)U(t)
on D,
(8.6)
for all t ∈R, f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s.
Conversely, one can reformulate a time-translation covariant QFT as a
quartet (F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1), with H replaced by a strongly continuous uni-
tary representation U : R →GL(F); R ∋t →U(t) ∈GL(F) satisfying
(8.6). Then, by Stone’s theorem, there exists a unique self-adjoint opera-
tor H on F such that U(t) = e−itH/ℏ, t ∈R. Hence, a time-translation
covariant QFT (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) is obtained.
By these considerations, we see that the theory (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) is
equivalent to the theory (F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1).
(4) Deﬁnition 8.2 gives a general concept of a QFT which has a unitary
covariance with respect to time. By adding covariances with respect to other
transformations, such as translations, rotations in space Rd and Poincar´e
transformations in R1+d (see Section 8.10.5), one obtains more specialized
forms of the theory. In particular, a relativistic QFT is a special form of
time-translation covariant QFT. We shall see these aspects in the following.
(5) The natural number s in Deﬁnition 8.2, which accounts the number
of the components of a multi-component quantum ﬁeld, depends on the kind
of quantum ﬁeld (scalar ﬁeld, vector ﬁeld, tensor ﬁeld, spinor ﬁeld, etc.).
For more details on this point, see, for example, Streater and Wightman
(1964), p. 99 and Bogoliubov et al. (1975), Chapter 3.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
523
(6) As is easily seen, if a self-adjoint operator H satisﬁes (8.5), then, for
all E ∈R, (8.5) with H replaced by H −E holds. But we regard H −E as
an operator essentially same as H.
For (ϕr)s
r=1, a self-adjoint operator H satisfying (8.5) is not necessarily
unique up to addition of scalar operators. In Proposition 8.1, we shall give
a suﬃcient condition for H to be unique up to addition of scalar operators.
8.3.2
Uniqueness of Hamiltonians
Proposition 8.1. Let (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a time-translation covariant
QFT on R1+d such that, for all t ∈R, eitHD ⊂D and
{ϕr(f)↾D|f ∈S (R1+d), r = 1, . . . , s}′ = CI,
where {· · · }′ denotes the commutant of {· · · } (see (5.68)). Suppose that there
exists a self-adjoint operator H′ satisfying (8.5) with H replaced by H′ such
that eitH′D ⊂D, for all t ∈R. Then, there exists a constant E ∈R such
that H′ = H + E.
Proof. By the assumption, we have
eitHϕr(f)e−itHΨ = eitH′ϕr(f)e−itH′Ψ,
for all Ψ
∈D, t ∈R, f
∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s (we have
replaced t/ℏby t). Hence, ϕr(f)e−itHΨ = e−itHeitH′ϕr(f)e−itH′Ψ. For
each Φ ∈D, Ψ := eitH′Φ is in D. Hence, letting T (t) := e−itHeitH′, we
obtain ϕr(f)T (t)Φ = T (t)ϕr(f)Φ. Hence,
T (t) ∈{ϕr(f)↾D|f ∈S (R1+d), r = 1, . . . , s}′.
Therefore, T (t) = c(t)I with a constant c(t), depending on t. Hence, eitH′ =
c(t)eitH. The unitarity of T (t) implies that |c(t)| = 1. The group property of
{eitH′}t∈R and {eitH}t∈R yields c(t + t′) = c(t)c(t′), t, t′ ∈R. In particular,
c(0) = 1. Since T (t) is strongly continuous in t, it follows that c(t) is
continuous in t. Hence, c(t) = eiEt for some constant E ∈R. This means
that eitH′ = eit(H+E), ∀t ∈R. Hence, H′ = H + E.

Sharp-time quantum ﬁelds
There are classes of quantum ﬁelds in which each quantum ﬁeld is well
deﬁned even if it is not smeared in the time variable t. We next introduce
such a class of quantum ﬁelds.
524
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Deﬁnition 8.3. A sharp-time QFT on R1+d is a quartet (F, D, H,
{ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s) (s ∈N) consisting of a Hilbert space F, a dense sub-
space D ⊂F, a self-adjoint operator H on F and a set {ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s
of operator-valued distributions on Rd with values in L(F) (ϕr(t, f) ∈
L(F), t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd)) satisfying the following (i) and (ii):
(i) For all t ∈R, r = 1, . . . , s and f ∈S (Rd), D ⊂D(ϕr(t, f)) ∩
D(ϕr(t, f)∗) and ϕr(t, f)D ⊂D, ϕr(t, f)∗D ⊂D.
(ii) For all t ∈R and f ∈S (Rd),
ϕr(t, f) = eitH/ℏϕr(0, f)e−itH/ℏ
on D.
(8.7)
The operator-valued distribution ϕr(t, ·) is called a quantum ﬁeld at
time t. In particular, ϕr(0, ·) is called a time-zero quantum ﬁeld. The
operator H is called the Hamiltonian.
A

QFT too.
Proposition 8.2. Let (F, D, H, {ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s) be a sharp-time QFT
on R1+d such that, for all t ∈R, eitHD ⊂D and
{ϕr(0, f)↾D|f ∈S (Rd), r = 1, . . . , s}′ = CI.
Suppose that there exists a self-adjoint operator H′ satisfying (8.7) with H
replaced by H′ such that eitH′D ⊂D. for all t ∈R. Then, there exists a
constant E ∈R such that H′ = H + E.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Proposition 8.1.
□
One can deduce a sharp-time QFT from a time-translation covari-
ant QFT with an additional property in the following manner. Let
(F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a time-translation covariant QFT with the additional
condition that
e−itH/ℏD ⊂D,
t ∈R.
(8.8)
Suppose that, for each t ∈R and r = 1, . . . , s, there exists an operator-
valued distribution ϕr(t, ·) satisfying the following (a)–(c):
(a) For all t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd) and r = 1, . . . , s, D ⊂D(ϕr(t, f)) ∩
D(ϕr(t, f)∗).
General Theory of Quantum Fields
525
(b) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D and f ∈S (Rd), the function:R ∋t →⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩
is continuous on R and

R
|u(t)| | ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩|dt < ∞,
u ∈S (R).
(8.9)
(c) For all Ψ, Φ ∈D, u ∈S (R) and f ∈S (Rd),
⟨Φ, ϕr(u × f)Ψ⟩=

R
u(t) ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩dt.
If such operator-valued distributions {ϕr(t, ·)}t,r exist, then each ϕ(t, f) ↾D
is unique. This is proved as follows.
Suppose that there exists another operator-valued distribution ηr(t, f)
satisfying the above (a)–(c) with ϕr(t, f) replaced by ηr(t, f). Then, it
follows from (c) that, for all u ∈S (R),

R
u(t) ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩dt =

R
u(t) ⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩dt.
By (b), the functions ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩, and ⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩of t are locally
integrable.
Hence,
by
du
Bois-Raymond’s lemma,
⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩
=
⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩a.e. t. Since both functions are continuous in t, it follows
that, for all t ∈R, ⟨Φ, ϕr(t, f)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, ηr(t, f)Ψ⟩. This holds for all
Φ ∈D and D is dense. Hence, ϕr(t, f)Ψ = ηr(t, f)Ψ, implying that
ϕr(t, f) ↾D = ηr(t, f) ↾D.
Let us show that (8.7) holds. For each t ∈R and a function u on R, we
deﬁne a function ut by
ut(x0) := u(x0 −t),
x0 ∈R.
The function ut is the time translation of u by t.
It is easy to see that, if u ∈S (R), then ut ∈S (R).
Let Ψ, Φ ∈D, f ∈S (Rd), u ∈S (R) and t ∈R. Then, by (c), we have
⟨Φ, ϕr(ut × f)Ψ⟩=

ϕr(x0 + t, f)Ψ = eitH/ℏϕr(x0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ.
Putting x0 = 0, we obtain ϕr(t, f)Ψ = eitH/ℏϕr(0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ. Thus, (8.7)
holds.
Conversely, there exists a structure which makes it possible to construct
a time-translation covariant QFT from a sharp-time QFT. We outline it
brieﬂy.
Let (F, D, H, {ϕr(t, ·)}t∈R,r=1,...,s) be a sharp-time QFT such that, for
all Ψ, Φ ∈D and f ∈S (Rd), the function R ∋t →⟨Ψ, ϕr(t, f)Φ⟩is
continuous and (8.9) holds.
[Step 1] For each pair (Ψ, Φ) ∈D × D, one deﬁnes a bilinear form LΨ,Φ
on S (R) × S (Rd) by
LΨ,Φ(u, f) :=

R
u(t) ⟨Ψ, ϕr(t, f)Φ⟩dt,
u ∈S (R), f ∈S (Rd).
[Step 2] Under additional conditions (if necessary), one shows that LΨ,Φ
is separately continuous (see Appendix D). Then, by Schwartz’s nuclear the-
orem (Theorem D.5 in Appendix D), there exists a unique LΨ,Φ ∈S ′(R1+d)
such that
LΨ,Φ(u × f) =

R
u(t) ⟨Ψ, ϕr(t, f)Φ⟩dt,
u ∈S (R), f ∈S (Rd).
[Step 3] Under additional conditions (if necessary), one shows that, for
all Φ ∈D and F ∈S (R1+d), the conjugate linear mapping Ψ →LΨ,Φ(F) ∈
C is a continuous linear functional.9 Then, by the density of D and Riesz’s
representation theorem, there exists a unique vector ΦF ∈F such that, for
all Ψ ∈D, LΨ,Φ(F) = ⟨Ψ, ΦF ⟩. So, one deﬁnes a mapping ϕr(F) : D →F
by ϕr(F)Φ := ΦF , Φ ∈D. The mapping ϕr(F) is a linear operator on F
with D(ϕr(F)) = D and linear in F.
9If Cr(u, f, Φ) := 
R |u(t)| ∥ϕr(t, f)Φ∥dt < ∞, then this holds since |LΨ,Φ(F )| ≤
Cr(u, f, Φ)∥Ψ∥.

[Step 4] One shows that (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) is a time-translation covari-
ant QFT.
The procedures schematically described here constitute a method of
providing a mathematically rigorous meaning to the heuristic expression
“

R u(t)ϕr(t, f)dt,” a sharp-time ﬁeld smeared in the time variable, as an
operator-valued distribution on R1+d. We remark, however, that the above
procedures are not always possible. It may depend on each individual sharp-
time QFT.
Examples of time-translation covariant QFT and sharp-time QFT will
be discussed in later chapters.

Equations for Quantum Fields
Let us derive diﬀerential equations for a quantum ﬁeld in a time-translation
covariant QFT. As in Appendix D, if a sequence {fn}n in S (R1+d) con-
verges to f ∈S (R1+d) in the topology of S (R1+d), we write fn

side, we obtain
|∂αgt(x)| ≤|t| sup
|τ|≤|t|
|∂βf(x0 + τ, x)|.
Let
xτ := (x0 + τ, x).
Then, for all x ∈R1+d,
|x| = |x −xτ + xτ| ≤|x −xτ| + |xτ| = |τ| + |xτ|.
Let |τ| ≤|t| ≤1. Then, |x| ≤1 + |xτ|. Hence, for all m ∈Z+,
(1 + |x|)m ≤(2 + |xτ|)m ≤2m(1 + |xτ|)m.
Hence,
(1 + |x|)m|∂αgt(x)| ≤2m|t| ∥f∥m,β.
Therefore,
∥gt∥m,α ≤2m|t| ∥f∥m,β →0
(t →0).
Thus, (8.10) holds.

For an operator-valued distribution ϕ on R1+d with values in L(F),
we denote by Dμϕ ∈S ′(R1+d, L(F)) the partial derivative of ϕ in the
variable xμ (μ = 0, 1, . . ., d):
Dμϕ(f) := −ϕ(∂μf),
ϕ ∈S ′(R1+d, L(F)), f ∈S (R1+d).
Theorem 8.1. Let (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a time-translation covariant
QFT, and suppose that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) D ⊂D(H).
(ii) For all f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s, HD ⊂D(ϕr(f)).
(iii) For all Ψ ∈D, f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s, the F-valued function
R ∋t →ϕr(f)e−itH/ℏΨ is strongly continuous.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (8.11) with n = 1. Let Ψ, Φ ∈D and f ∈S (R1+d).
Then,
⟨Φ, D0ϕr(f)Ψ⟩= −⟨Φ, ϕr(∂0f)Ψ⟩.
By applying Lemma 8.1 to ∂0f on the right-hand side, we have

To compute the right-hand side, we note the following facts:

and, for all Ξ ∈D(H),

Condition (iii) implies that
lim
t→0 ϕr(f)e−itH/ℏΨ = ϕr(f)Ψ.
Using these facts, we obtain
⟨Φ, D0ϕr(f)Ψ⟩=

Since D is dense, (8.11) with n = 1 follows.
To prove (8.11) with n arbitrary, we use the method by induction in n.
Suppose that (8.11) holds with n = k. Then,
Dk+1

(8.13) are realized as dynamical equations of the quantum ﬁeld (ϕr)s
r=1.

Vacuum Expectation Values and Wightman
Distributions
Let us consider a time-translation covariant QFT (F, D, H, (ϕr)s
r=1) on
R1+d such that H is bounded from below. We consider the case where H
has a ground state (see Section 4.8) and suppose that
ker(H −E0(H)) ⊂D.
We should remark that it is non-trivial at all to prove the existence of a
ground state in concrete models in QFT. Indeed, to prove the existence or
absence of a ground state in QFT is one of the most important and central
10In general, an operator-valued function X : R ∋t 	→X(t) ∈L(H ) (H is a Hilbert
space) is said to obey the Heisenberg equation of motion on a subspace D ⊂H with
respect to a self-adjoint operator H on H if D ⊂D([H, X(t)], t ∈R and, for all Ψ ∈D,
X(t)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable on R with strong derivative (see Deﬁnition 1.1 (ii))

issues in mathematical theory of QFT. We shall come back to this aspect
later (see Chapters 13 and 14).
Let Ψ0 ∈ker(H −E0(H)) be a unit vector (∥Ψ0∥= 1). Then, for n ∈
N and (r1, . . . , rn) ∈{1, . . ., s}n, one can deﬁne a functional E(n)
r1,...,rn on
S (R1+d)n by
E(n)
r1,...,rn(f1, . . . , fn) := ⟨Ψ0, ϕr1(f1) · · · ϕrn(fn)Ψ0⟩,
for all (f1, . . . , fn) ∈S (R1+d)n. These functionals are called the n-point
vacuum expectation values (VEV) of (ϕr)s
r=1 with respect to the vac-
uum Ψ0.
It is easy to see that E(n)
r1,...,rn is an n-linear form on S (R1+d). Since the
correspondence S (R1+d) ∋f →⟨Ψ, ϕr(f)Φ⟩(Ψ, Φ ∈D) is continuous in
the topology of S (R1+d), it follows that E(n)
r1,...,rn is separately continuous.
Hence, by Schwartz’s nuclear theorem (Theorem D.5 in Appendix D), there
exists a unique element W (n)
r1,...,rn in S ′((R1+d)n) such that
W (n)
r1,...,rn(f1×· · ·×fn) = Er1,...,rn(f1, . . . , fn),
fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n.
Therefore,
W (n)
r1,...,rn(f1 × · · · × fn) = ⟨Ψ0, ϕr1(f1) · · · ϕrn(fn)Ψ0⟩.
The tempered distributions W (n)
r1,...,rn are called the n-point Wightman
distributions with respect to the vacuum Ψ0.
In concrete models in QFT, it is heuristically shown that many physical
properties contained in QFT may be derived from the set of Wightman
distributions, although we do not discuss this aspect here.11
Remark 8.4. In a sharp-time QFT (F, D, H, (ϕr(t, ·))t∈R,r=1,...,s), the
VEVs are deﬁned as follows:
⟨Ψ0, ϕr1(t1, f1) · · · ϕrn(tn, fn)Ψ0⟩,
for n ∈N, rj ∈{1, . . . , s}, tj ∈R and fj ∈S (Rd) (j = 1, . . . , n).
11For example, the so-called scattering-matrix (S-matrix), which describes probability
amplitudes for scattering phenomena of elementary particles, are represented in terms
of Wightman distributions.

A General Form of Canonical Formalism in QFT
In this section, we formulate a general form of the canonical formalism
in QFT (see Remark 8.3). For simplicity, we consider only the case of a
quantum scalar ﬁeld.
We denote by SR(Rn) (n ∈N) the space of real-valued rapidly
decreasing functions on Rn:
SR(Rn) := {f ∈S (Rn)|f ∗= f}.
(8.14)
This space is a dense subspace of the real Hilbert space
L2
R(Rn) := {f ∈L2(Rn)|f ∗= f}.
(8.15)
Note that the complexiﬁcation of the real Hilbert space L2
R(Rn) is L2(Rn):
(L2
R(Rn))C = L2(Rn).
We consider a sharp-time QFT (F, D, H, {ϕ(t, ·), π(t, ·)}t∈R) on R1+d
(d ∈N).12 We say that it is a canonical QFT if the following are satisﬁed:
(i) For each (t, f) ∈R × SR(Rd), ϕ(t, f) and π(t, f) are symmetric.
(ii) (equal-time CCR) For all f, g ∈S (Rd) and t ∈R, the following com-
mutation relations hold on D:
[ϕ(t, f), π(t, g)] = iℏ

Rd f(x)g(x)dx = iℏ⟨f ∗, g⟩L2(Rd),
[ϕ(t, f), ϕ(t, g)] = 0,
[π(t, f), π(t, g)] = 0.
(iii) For all f ∈S (Rd) and Φ, Ψ ∈D, the function R ∋t →⟨Φ, ϕ(t, f)Ψ⟩
is diﬀerentiable on R, with
d
dt ⟨Φ, ϕ(t, f)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, π(t, f)Ψ⟩,
t ∈R.
(8.16)
The operator-valued function π(t, f) is called the canonical conjugate
momentum of ϕ(t, f).
Properties (i) and (ii) above show that, for each t ∈R, {ϕ(t, f),
π(t, f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} gives a representation of the Heisenberg CCR over
SR(Rd) (see Deﬁnition 5.8). In particular, the set of the time-zero ﬁelds

π(t, ·).
General Theory of Quantum Fields
533
{ϕ(0, f), π(0, f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} is a representation of the Heisenberg CCR
over SR(Rd). This is one of the features of canonical formalism of QFT.
Remark 8.5. (i) In general, an operator-valued function F : R →X (X is
a Hilbert space) (F(t) ∈L(X ), t ∈R) is said to be weakly diﬀerentiable
on a dense subspace E ⊂X if the following hold:
(i) E ⊂D(F(t)), t ∈R.
(ii) For all Φ, Ψ ∈E , ⟨Φ, F(t)Ψ⟩is diﬀerentiable on R and
d
dt ⟨Φ, F(t)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, F ′
w(t)Ψ⟩,
with an operator-valued function F ′
w : R →L(X ) such that E ⊂
D(F ′
w(t)), t ∈R (note that F ′
w(t) ↾E is uniquely determined due to
the density of E ).
The operator-valued function F ′
w(·) ↾E is called the weak derivative of
F(·) ↾E . The following symbols are also used:
F ′
w(t) = w- d
dtF(t) = w-dF(t)
dt
.
From this point of view, (8.16) means that π(t, f) ↾D is the weak derivative
of ϕ(t, f) ↾D:
w- d
dtϕ(t, f) = π(t, f)
on D.
(8.17)
(ii) Instead of condition (8.16) or (8.17), one can take a stronger one, i.e.,
s- d
dtϕ(t, f) = π(t, f),
on D,
where s-d/dt denotes strong diﬀerentiation (see Deﬁnition 1.1 (iii)).
However, in an axiomatic theory, it may be better to start with a weaker
condition; stronger conditions can be assumed in the development of
the theory if necessary. An advantage of this approach is that one can
understand the mathematical structure of the theory clearer.
Proposition 8.3. Let (F, D, H, {ϕ(t, ·), π(t, ·)}t∈R) be a canonical QFT
on R1+d such that D ⊂D(H). Suppose that, for all Ψ ∈D, f ∈SR(Rd)
and t ∈R,
lim
ε→0 ϕ(0, f)e−i(t+ε)H/ℏΨ = ϕ(0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ.

i
ℏ{⟨HΦ, ϕ(t, f)Ψ⟩−⟨ϕ(t, f)Φ, HΨ⟩} = ⟨Φ, π(t, f)Ψ⟩.
(8.18)
If HD ⊂D(ϕ(t, f)) for all (t, f) ∈R × SR(Rd) in addition, then
i
ℏ[H, ϕ(t, f)]Ψ = π(t, f)Ψ.
(8.19)
Proof. Let Φ, Ψ ∈D and t ∈R. We set
Fε := 1
ε ⟨Φ, (ϕ(t + ε, f) −ϕ(t, f))Ψ⟩,
ε ∈R \ {0}.
Then, by (8.16), we have limε→0 Fε = ⟨Φ, π(t, f)Ψ⟩. By (8.7), we can write
Fε =

ϕ(0, f)e−i(t+ε)H/ℏΦ, e−itH/ℏ1
ε(e−iεH/ℏ−1)Ψ

+
1
ε(e−iεH/ℏ−1)Φ, ϕ(t, f)Ψ

.
Since Ψ and Φ are in D(H) under the present assumption, it follows that
lim
ε→0
1
ε(e−iεH/ℏ−1)Ψ = −i
ℏHΨ,
lim
ε→0
1
ε(e−iεH/ℏ−1)Φ = −i
ℏHΦ.
Hence,


.
This implies (8.18).
If HD ⊂D(ϕ(t, f)) for all (t, f) ∈R × SR(Rd), then the left-hand side
of (8.18) is written as
i
ℏ{⟨Φ, Hϕ(t, f)Ψ⟩−⟨Φ, ϕ(t, f)HΨ⟩} = ⟨Φ, π(t, f)Ψ⟩.
Since D is dense in F, (8.19) follows.

In the canonical QFT (F, D, H, {ϕ(t, ·), π(t, ·)}t∈R) in Proposition 8.3,

Example: A Free Neutral Scalar Quantum Field
In the theory in Section 5.18, we consider the case where H = L2(Rd), C is
the complex conjugation (i.e., Cf = f ∗, f ∈L2(Rd)) so that HC = L2
R(Rd)
and T is a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on L2(Rd) such
that, for all f ∈D(T ), f ∗∈D(T ) and T f ∗= (T f)∗. We denote by a(f)
and a(f)∗(f ∈L2(Rd)) the annihilation operator and the creation operator
(with test function f), respectively, on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd))

the second quantization of T on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)). For
each t ∈R, we deﬁne the following operators:
ϕfree(t, f) := ℏeitH0/ℏφF(T −1/2f)e−itH0/ℏ,
f ∈D(T −1/2),
πfree(t, g) := eitH0/ℏπF(T 1/2g)e−itH0/ℏ,
g ∈D(T 1/2),
where φF(·) and πF(·) are the canonical ﬁeld and the canonical conjugate
momentum over (L2(Rd), C), respectively (see (5.152) and (5.153)). Note
that the operator ϕfree(t, f) (resp., πfree(t, f)) is the operator φα(t, f) (resp,
πα(t, g)) with α = 1/2 and ℏ= 1 in the notation of Section 5.18. It is
obvious that
ϕfree(0, f) = ℏφF(T −1/2f),
πfree(0, g) = πF(T 1/2g).
Hence,
ϕfree(t, f) = eitH0/ℏϕfree(0, f)e−itH0/ℏ,
πfree(t, g) = eitH0/ℏπfree(0, g)e−itH0/ℏ.
By (5.186) and (5.187), we have
ϕfree(t, f) = ℏφS(eitT/ℏT −1/2f),
πfree(t, g) = φS(ieitT/ℏT 1/2g).

It follows from Theorem 5.23 that, for all f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩L2
R(Rd) and g ∈
D(T 1/2) ∩L2
R(Rd), ϕfree(t, f) and πfree(t, g) are self-adjoint and essentially

where ΩL2(Rd) is the Fock vacuum in Fb(L2(Rd)). Then, it follows from
(8.23) and (8.25) that, for all f ∈S (Rd) and t ∈R, ϕfree(t, f)DT ⊂DT
and πfree(t, f)DT ⊂DT . Moreover, for all f, g ∈S (Rd) and t ∈R, the
following commutation relations hold on DT :

[ϕfree(t, f), ϕfree(t, g)] = 0,
[πfree(t, f), πfree(t, g)] = 0.
By using (8.25) and Example 8.5, one can show that ϕfree(t, ·) and
πfree(t, ·) are operator-valued distributions on Rd with common domain DT .

It follows from Theorem 5.33 that, for all Ψ ∈DT , the vector-valued
function t →ϕfree(t, f)Ψ is strong diﬀerentiable on R with strong derivative
d
dtϕfree(t, f)Ψ = πfree(t, f)Ψ.
Since a strong limit for vectors implies a weak limit for them, it follows
that, for all Φ, Ψ ∈DT , ⟨Φ, ϕfree(t, f)Ψ⟩is diﬀerentiable in t, with
d
dt ⟨Φ, ϕfree(t, f)Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, πfree(t, f)Ψ⟩.
Thus, (Fb(L2(Rd), DT , H0, {ϕfree(t, ·), πfree(t, ·)}t∈R) is a canonical QFT on
R1+d. By Theorem 5.33, we also see that ϕfree(t, f) obeys the diﬀerential
equation
d2
dt2 ϕfree(t, f)Ψ + 1
ℏ2 ϕfree(t, T 2f)Ψ = 0,
Ψ ∈DT .
(8.26)
Hence, ϕfree(t, ·) obeys a linear equation, which describes no interactions of
ϕfree(t, ·) with itself or other ﬁelds. In this sense, φ(t, ·) is said to be free.
The model (Fb(L2(Rd), DT , H0, {ϕfree(t, ·), πfree(t, ·)}t∈R) is called the
free neutral scalar quantum ﬁeld on R1+d with one-particle Hamil-
tonian T , where “neutral” means that, for all real-valued functions f ∈
SR(Rd), ϕfree(t, f) is symmetric.
A typical example of T is given by
T = L1/2
m ,
m > 0,
where Lm is deﬁned by (1.93). By the functional calculus for −Δ and
Fourier analysis, one can show that, for all α ∈R,
Fd,ℏLα/2
m F −1
d,ℏ= MEα
m
(see Section 1.8.3). Using this fact, one can check assumption (8.23). In the
present case, we have T 2 = Lm = −ℏ2c2Δ + m2c4. Hence, (8.26) takes the
following form:

ℏ2 ϕfree(t, x) = 0
(x0 = ct)
in the sense of operator-valued distribution, where ϕfree(t, x) is the
operator-valued distribution kernel of ϕfree(t, f). Hence, the operator-
valued distribution ϕfree(t, x) obeys the (1 + d)-dimensional free Klein–
Gordon equation with constant term m2c2/ℏ2.13 We call the quantum ﬁeld
ϕfree(t, f) the sharp-time free neutral quantum Klein–Gordon ﬁeld
with mass m. This quantum ﬁeld is discussed in detail in Chapter 10.

Unitary Representations of Topological Groups
Before discussing a general theory of QFT further, we here take a
mathematical interlude.
As is well known, a classical mechanical system may have various sym-
metries, which are described by transformation groups on the space–time.
On the other hand, a symmetry in a quantum system is given as a form of
unitary representation of a group (see Section 2.9.2).
A basic fact on strongly continuous unitary representations of Rn as a
translation group is given in the following theorem.
Theorem 8.2. Let n ∈N and H be a Hilbert space. Let U : Rn →U(H )
(the unitary group on H ) be a strongly continuous unitary representation
of Rn, i.e., for each a ∈Rn, U(a) ∈U(H ) and the mapping:a →U(a) is
strongly continuous and satisﬁes
U(a + b) = U(a)U(b),
a, b ∈Rn.
(8.28)
Then, there exists a unique n-tuple (A1, . . . , An) of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H such that
U(a) = eia1A1 · · · eianAn,
a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈Rn,
13Let M > 0 be a constant. The partial diﬀerential equation

Klein–Gordon equation with constant term M2.
General Theory of Quantum Fields

where the order of the exponential operators eiajAj (j = 1, . . . , n) in the
operator product on the right-hand side can be arbitrary.
Proof. Let {ej}n
j=1 be the standard basis of Rn so that, for all a =
(a1, . . . , an) ∈Rn, a = n
j=1 ajej. For each j = 1, . . . , n, we deﬁne
Uj(t) := U(tej), t ∈R. Then, it is easy to see that {Uj(t)}t∈R is a
strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Hence, by Stone’s theo-
rem (Theorem 1.30), there exists a unique self-adjoint operator Aj on H
such that Uj(t) = eitAj, t ∈R. Since U(a + b) = U(b + a), we have
U(a)U(b) = U(b)(a),
a, b ∈Rn,
i.e., the set {U(a)}a∈Rn is commutative. Hence,
Uj(aj)Uk(ak) = Uk(ak)Uj(aj),
j, k = 1, . . . , n,
implying that eiajAjeiakAk = eiakAkeiajAj. Hence, Aj and Ak are strongly
commuting. Thus, (A1, . . . , An) is an n-tuple of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H .
By (8.28), we have for all permutations σ ∈Sn,
U(a) = U(aσ(1)eσ(1) + · · · + aσ(n)Aσ(n))
= U(aσ(1)Aσ(1)) · · · U(aσ(n)Aσ(n))
= eiaσ(1)Aσ(1) · · · eiaσ(n)Aσ(n).
This completes the proof.
□
The n-tuple (A1, . . . , An) in Lemma 8.2 is called the generator of the
strongly continuous unitary representation {U(a)|a ∈Rn}.
Let X be a topological space and H be a Hilbert space. A mapping
f : X →H is said to be weakly continuous if, for all ψ ∈H , the
function X ∋x →⟨ψ, f(x)⟩is continuous.
A mapping T : X →B(H ) is said to be weakly continuous if, for all
ψ ∈H , the function X ∋x →T (x)ψ is weakly continuous.
The following fact is useful in applications.
Lemma 8.2. Let U : X →U(H ); X ∋x →U(x) ∈U(H ) be weakly
continuous. Then, U is strongly continuous.
Proof. Let ψ ∈H and a ∈X be ﬁxed arbitrarily. Put φ := U(a)ψ. Then,
by the weak continuity of U, for any ε > 0, there exists a neighborhood

Va of a such that, for all x ∈Va, | ⟨φ, U(x)ψ⟩−⟨φ, U(a)ψ⟩| < ε. Since
⟨φ, U(a)ψ⟩= ∥ψ∥2, we have
 ∥ψ∥2 −⟨U(a)ψ, U(x)ψ⟩
 < ε,
x ∈Va.
Hence,
∥U(x)ψ −U(a)ψ∥2 = 2(∥ψ∥2 −Re ⟨U(a)ψ, U(x)ψ⟩) < 2ε,
x ∈Va.
Hence, U(·)ψ is strongly continuous at x = a.
□
Lemma 8.2 can be brought into a more convenient form.
Lemma 8.3. Let X be a topological space, U : X →U(H ) and D be a
dense subspace in H . Suppose that, for all ψ, φ ∈D, the function: X ∋
x →⟨φ, U(x)ψ⟩is continuous. Then, U is strongly continuous.
Proof. By Lemma 8.2, we need only to show the weak continuity of U.
For any ψ, φ ∈H , we set F(x) := ⟨ψ, U(x)φ⟩. By the density of D, there
exist sequences {ψn}n and {φn}n such that ψn →ψ, φn →φ (n →∞). Let
Fn(x) := ⟨ψn, U(x)φn⟩. Then,
|Fn(x) −F(x)| = | ⟨ψn −ψ, U(x)φn⟩+ ⟨ψ, U(x)(φn −φ)⟩|
≤∥ψn −ψ∥C + ∥ψ∥∥φn −φ∥,
where C := supn≥1 ∥φn∥< ∞. For any ε > 0, there exist an n0 ∈N such
that, for all n ≥n0, ∥ψn −ψ∥C + ∥ψ∥∥φn −φ∥< ε Hence,
sup
x∈X
|Fn(x) −F(x)| ≤ε,
n ≥n0.
Now, we ﬁx a ∈X arbitrarily. For any x ∈X, by the triangle inequality,
|F(x) −F(a)| ≤|F(x) −Fn0(x)| + |Fn0(x) −Fn0(a)| + |Fn0(a) −F(a)|
≤2ε + |Fn0(x) −F(a)|.
Since the function Fn0 is continuous on X, for any ε > 0, there exists a
neighborhood Va of a such that
Va ⊂{x ∈X| |Fn0(x) −Fn0(a)| < ε}.
Hence, for all x ∈Va, |F(x) −F(a)| < 3ε. This means that F is continuous
at x = a.
□
General Theory of Quantum Fields
541
Example 8.6. For each a ∈R1+d, a mapping u(a) : L2(R1+d) →L2(R1+d)
is deﬁned as follows:
u(a)f = fa,
f ∈L2(R1+d),
where fa is the translation of f by a (see (8.4)). It is easy to see that u(a)
is unitary and
u(a + b) = u(a)u(b) = u(b)u(a),
a, b ∈R1+d.
By applying Lemma 8.3 with (X, H , D) = (R1+d, L2(R1+d), C∞
0 (R1+d)),
one can show that u(a) is strongly continuous in a. Hence, by Theorem 8.2,
there exists a unique (1 + d)-tuple (π0, π1, . . . , πd) of strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators on L2(R1+d) such that
u(a) = eia0π0eia1π1 · · · eiadπd.
By considering the strong derivative of u(0, . . . , 0, aμ, 0, . . . , 0)f (f
∈
C∞
0 (R1+d)) at aμ = 0, one can show that
πμ = iDμ
(μ = 0, 1, . . . , d),
with Dμ being the generalized partial diﬀerential operator in the variable
xμ acting in L2(R1+d). As is seen, this example with 1 + d replaced by d
gives a proof of Theorem 1.40.
8.9
Translation Covariant QFT
Let F be a Hilbert space as before, D be a dense subspace in F and
(ϕr)s
r=1 be an s-tuple of operator-valued distributions on R1+d with values
in L(F) such that, for all f ∈S (R1+d) and r = 1, . . . , s, D ⊂D(ϕr(f)) ∩
D(ϕr(f)∗) and ϕr(f)D ⊂D, ϕr(f)∗D ⊂D. Suppose that there exists
a strongly continuous unitary representation U : R1+d →U(F) of the
(1+d)-dimensional translation group R1+d such that, for all f ∈S (R1+d),
r = 1, . . . , s and a ∈R1+d,
ϕr(fa) = U(a)ϕr(f)U(a)−1
on D.
The, (F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1) is called a translation covariant QFT on R1+d.
By Lemma 8.2, there exists a unique (1 + d)-tuple
P := (P0, P1, . . . , Pd)
542
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on F such that
U(a) = eia0P0/ℏeia1P1/ℏ· · · eiadPd/ℏ,
a ∈R1+d.
The operator vector P is called the energy–momentum operator of the
quantum ﬁeld (ϕr)s
r=1. The 0th component P0 and the d-tuple of the other
components
P := (P 1, . . . , P d)
with P j := −Pj (j = 1, . . . , d) are, respectively, called the Hamiltonian
and the momentum operator of the translation covariant QFT under
consideration.14
By an application of Proposition 1.48, we have
eitP0/ℏPμe−itP0/ℏ= Pμ,
μ = 0, 1, . . . , d, t ∈R.
Namely, each Pμ is a conserved quantity.15 Hence, in particular, the energy–
momentum operator is a conserved quantity.
Since the energy–momentum operator P is strongly commuting, it
has the joint spectrum σJ(P) (see Section 1.8.2). This set is called
the energy–momentum spectrum of the translation covariant QFT
(F, D, U, (ϕr)s
r=1). This is an important quantity which characterizes the
QFT.
Since P is strongly commuting, ((P 1)2, . . . , (P d)2) is also strongly com-
muting (apply Theorem 1.36). Hence, it follows from Corollary 1.7(ii) that
P 2 :=
d

j=1
(P j)2 =
d

j=1
P 2
j
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator. Therefore, one can deﬁne a non-
negative self-adjoint operator |P | by
|P | :=

P 21/2 .
We call |P | the modulus of the momentum operator P .
The dual space
(R1+d)∗:= {k = (k0, k1, . . . , kd)|kμ ∈R, μ = 0, 1, . . ., d}
of the space-time R1+d is called the wave number vector space.16
14Sometimes, (P1, . . . , Pd) is also called the momentum operator.
15In a quantum system whose Hamiltonian is given by a self-adjoint operator H on
a Hilbert space, independent of time t, a linear operator A (a quantum mechanical
quantity) on H is said to be a conserved quantity if its Heisenberg operator with
respect to H is independent of t: eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ= A, ∀t ∈R. An n-tuple (A1, . . . , An)
of linear operators is said to be a conserved quantity if each Aj is a conserved quantity.
16Sometimes the symbol R1+d
x
(resp., R1+d
k
) is used instead of R1+d (resp., (R1+d)∗).
General Theory of Quantum Fields

By the de Broglie–Einstein–Planck relation, the momentum p of a quan-
tum particle is related to the wave number vector k by
p = ℏk.
Hence, p ∈ℏ(R1+d)∗:= {ℏk|k ∈(R1+d)∗}. Based on this relation, we write
R1+d
p
:= ℏ(R1+d)∗.
A natural bilinear form on R1+d × R1+d
p
: (x, p) →R is given by
xp :=

μ=0
xμpμ,
x ∈R1+d, p ∈R1+d
p
.
For each p = (p0, p1, . . . , pd) ∈R1+d
p
, the component p0 denotes the
energy coordinate and (p1, . . . , pd) the momentum coordinate. We
set
p := (p1, . . . , pd),
pj := −pj.
The above energy–momentum spectrum σJ(P) is physically interpreted
as a subset of R1+d
p
.
An operator inequality for the components of P gives a condition on
σJ(P).
Proposition 8.4. Let γ > 0 be a constant. Then,
P0 ≥γ|P |.
(8.29)
if and only if
σJ(P) ⊂{p ∈R1+d
p
| p0 ≥γ|p|}.
(8.30)
Proof. We denote by EP
the joint spectral measure of P. Hence,
supp EP = σJ(P).
We ﬁrst show by contraposition that (8.29) implies (8.30). Hence,
suppose that (8.30) does not hold. Then, there exists a Borel set B ⊂σJ(P)
such that, for all p ∈B, p0 < γ|p| and EP (B) ̸= 0. Let Kn := {p ∈
R1+d| |p| ≤n} (n ∈N). Then, R1+d = ∪∞
n=1Kn. Hence, B = ∪∞
n=1Bn with
Bn := Kn ∩B. If EP (Bn) = 0 for all n ∈N, then EP (B) = 0. But this is a
contradiction. Hence, for some n0, EP (Bn0) ̸= 0. We set B0 := Bn0. Then,
B0 is bounded and EP (B0) ̸= 0. Hence, for all non-zero ψ ∈RanEP (B0),
ψ ∈D(P0) ∩D(|P |) and
⟨ψ, (P0 −γ|P |)ψ⟩=

B0
(p0 −γ|p|)d∥EP (p)ψ∥2 < 0.
544

Hence, (8.29) does not hold. Thus, (8.29) implies (8.30).
We next show that (8.30) implies (8.29). Hence, suppose that (8.30)
holds. Let ψ ∈D(P0). Then,

A condition for σJ(P) such as (8.30) is called a spectral condition.
Proposition 8.4 gives a correspondence between a spectral condition and
an operator inequality. for P0 and |P |.
Proposition 8.4 has an application to relativistic QFT, which is discussed
in the following section.
In what follows, we sometimes write (F, D, P, (ϕr)s
r=1) for the transla-
tion covariant QFT on R1+d.
In a translation covariant QFT, the relations of eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian with those of the momentum operator are also important.
To examine this aspect, we note the following lemma.
Lemma 8.4. Let X be a Hilbert space and A, B be strongly commuting
self-adjoint operators on X . Suppose that σp(A) ̸= ∅. Let λ ∈σp(A) and
M := ker(A −λ) (the eigenspace of A with eigenvalue λ). Then:
(i) M reduces B.
(ii) If m := dim M < ∞, then there exists a CONS {ψj}m
j=1 of M such
that each ψj is an eigenvector of B.
Proof. (i) By Proposition 1.48(ii), AeisBψ = eisBAψ,
ψ ∈D(A). In
particular, for all ψ ∈M , AeisBψ = λeisBψ. This means that eisBψ ∈M .
Hence, for all s ∈R, eisB leaves M invariant. It follows that eisBM = M
for all s.17 Hence, for all s ∈R, eisB can be regarded as a unitary operator on
M . Let PM be the orthogonal projection onto M . Then, by the property of
17In general, if W is a unitary operator on a Hilbert space H and D is a subspace in
H such that W D ⊂D and W ∗D ⊂D, then W D = D (this is easy to prove).
General Theory of Quantum Fields
545
eisB just proved, PM eisBPM = eisBPM for all s ∈R. Taking the adjoint of
both sides and replacing −s with s, we have PM eisBPM = PM eisB. Hence,
eisBPM = PMeisB. Therefore, for all φ ∈D(B), PMeisBφ = eisBPM φ.
Considering the strong diﬀerentiation of both sides at s = 0, we see that
PM φ ∈D(B) and BPM φ = PM Bφ. Hence, PM B ⊂BPM . Thus, M
reduces B.
(ii) We denote by BM the reduced part of B to M . Since M is an
m-dimensional Hilbert space under the present assumption, the spectrum
of BM consists of only eigenvalues with ﬁnite multiplicity. By the self-
adjointness of BM, there exists a CONS {ψj}m
j=1 in which each ψj is an
eigenvector of BM.
□
A non-zero vector ψ in a Hilbert space X is called a simultaneous
eigenvector of some linear operators T1, . . . , Tn on X if it is an eigenvector
of each Tj (j = 1, . . . , n).
Each vector ψj in Lemma 8.4(ii) is a simultaneous eigenvector of A and
B: Aψj = λψj, Bψj = μjψj, where μj is an eigenvalue of BM.
Thus, Lemma 8.4 means that two strongly commuting self-adjoint oper-
ators have a simultaneous eigenvector if one of A and B has an eigenvalue
with ﬁnite multiplicity.
Theorem 8.3. Let (F, D, P, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a translation covariant QFT.
Suppose that P0 is bounded from below and has a unique ground state Ψ0.
Then, Ψ0 is an eigenvector of each Pj (j = 1, . . . , d).
Proof. Let j = 1, . . . , d be ﬁxed. Applying Lemma 8.4 with A = P0 and
B = Pj and using the assumption dim ker(P0 −E0(P0)) = 1, there exist
a unit vector Ψj ∈ker(P0 −E0(P0)) and a real constant μj such that
PjΨj = μjΨj. It is obvious that Ψ0 = cjΨj for some constant cj ̸= 0. Hence,
PjΨ0 = μjΨ0.
□
Theorem 8.3 tells us that, in a translation covariant QFT, a ground
state of the Hamiltonian P0 is a simultaneous eigenvector of the energy–
momentum operator P if the ground state is unique.
Corollary 8.1. Let (F, D, P, (ϕr)s
r=1) be a translation covariant QFT
satisfying (8.29) (hence, P0 ≥0). Suppose that E0(P0) = 0 and P0 has
a unique ground state Ψ0: P0Ψ0 = 0. Then, PjΨ0 = 0 (j = 1, . . . , d). In
particular, 0 ∈σJ(P).
Proof. By Theorem 8.3, PjΨ0 = μjΨ0 for some μj ∈R (j = 1, . . . , d).
This implies that |P |Ψ0 =

j = 0, which
implies that μj = 0, j = 1, . . . , d. Thus, PjΨ0 = 0.

Review of Some Aspects Related to the Theory
of Special Relativity
As is well known, there are two categories in classical ﬁeld theory,
namely, the relativistic ﬁelds and the non-relativistic ﬁelds. This kind of
classiﬁcation is possible in QFT too. In the rest of this book, we discuss
both of relativistic and non-relativistic quantum ﬁelds. However, before
doing that, we still need some mathematical preliminaries.
8.10.1
Minkowski space–time
We ﬁrst recall a general concept of Minkowski space. Let V be a (1 + d)-
dimensional real vector space. A metric18 q : V × V →R on V is called a
Minkowski metric if there exists a basis (ϵμ)d
μ=0 on V such that
q(ϵμ, ϵν) = gμν,
μ, ν = 0, . . . , d,
18See Footnote 4.
General Theory of Quantum Fields

where the matrix (gμν) is deﬁned as follows:
g00 = 1,
gjj = −1,
j = 1, . . . , d,
(8.31)
gμν = 0,
μ ̸= ν, μ, ν = 0, . . . , d.
(8.32)
It follows that, for all u = d
μ=0 uμϵμ ∈V and v = d
ν=0 vνϵν ∈V
(uμ, vν ∈R),
q(u, v) =
d

μ,ν=0
gμνuμvν.
As is easily seen, q is an indeﬁnite metric. The indeﬁnite metric space (V, q)
is called a (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space.
Remark 8.8. There are many Minkowski metrics on V . Indeed, for each
bijective linear mapping T on V (i.e., T ∈GL(V )), the mapping qT :
V × V →R deﬁned by
qT (u, v) := q(T −1u, T −1v),
u, v ∈V
(8.33)
is a Minkowski metric since qT (T ϵμ, T ϵν) = gμν and (T ϵμ)d
μ=0 is a basis
of V . Conversely, it is not diﬃcult to show that, for any Minkowski metric
q′ on V , there exists a T ∈GL(V ) such that q′ = qT . Note that T as a
mapping from the Minkowski space (V, q) onto (V, qT ) preserves the metric:
qT (T u, T v) = q(u, v), u, v ∈V . Hence, (V, q) is isomorphic to (V, qT ). In
this sense, a Minkowski metric on V is essentially unique.
We now consider the case where V = R1+d and deﬁne a mapping gM :
R1+d × R1+d →R by
gM(x, y) := x0y0 −
d

j=1
xjyj,
x = (xμ)d
μ=0, y = (yμ)μ=0 ∈R1+d.
It is easy to see that gM is a metric on R1+d. Let {eμ}d
μ=0 be the standard
basis of R1+d:
e0 = (1, 0, . . ., 0),
e1 = (0, 1, 0, . . ., 0),
...
ed = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1).

Then,
gM(eμ, eν) = gμν,
μ, ν = 0, . . . , d,
where (gμν) is deﬁned by (8.31) and (8.32). Hence, gM is a Minkowski
metric on R1+d. In what follows, we write
xy := gM(x, y),
x, y ∈M1+d,
and call it the Minkowski inner product of x and y, although it is
indeﬁnite.
In the special theory of relativity with space dimension d, the space-time
is taken to be the Minkowski space (R1+d, gM), in which each element in
R1+d represents a space-time point. The Minkowski space (R1+d, gM) in this
sense is called the (1+d)-dimensional Minkowski space–time. We denote
it by M1+d. In this context, x0 (resp., (x1, . . . , xd)) in x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd) ∈
M1+d is called the time (resp., space) component.
The (1 + d) × (1 + d) matrix
g := (gμν)
is called the metric matrix. It follows that
g2 = I1+d,
(8.34)
the (1 + d) × (1 + d) identity matrix. In terms of the metric matrix g, the
Minkowski inner product xy (x, y ∈M1+d) is written as
xy = x · gy = gx · y,
where x · y denotes the Euclidean inner product of R1+d:
x · y :=
d

μ=0
xμyμ.
We denote by (M1+d)∗the dual space of M1+d (i.e., the set of linear
functionals on M1+d). For each μ = 0, 1 . . ., d, the mapping f μ : M1+d →R
deﬁned by
f μ(x) := xμ,
x ∈M1+d,
is an element of (M1+d)∗. The {f μ}μ=0,...,d is a basis of (M1+d)∗and called
the dual basis of {eμ}d
μ=0.
Each x ∈M1+d is written as
x =
d

μ=0
xμeμ.

The real number kμ denotes the μth component of k with respect to the

kμxμ.
We sometimes write this as kx or xk and call the mapping: (M1+d)∗×
M1+d ∋(k, x) →kx ∈R the natural bilinear form on (M1+d)∗× M1+d.
The dual space (M1+d)∗is also a Minkowski space with metric

For each x ∈M1+d, the mapping x′ : M1+d →R deﬁned by
x′(y) := xy,
y ∈M1+d,
is an element of (M1+d)∗. Hence, one can deﬁne a mapping ι : M1+d →
(M1+d)∗by
ι(x) := x′,
x ∈M1+d.
It is easy to see that ι is linear and bijective. Namely, ι is an isomorphism
between M1+d and (M1+d)∗. The linear functional ι(x) is called the dual
element of x. Note that this concept is independent of the choice of the
basis of M1+d.19
It is easy to see that

Hence, the coordinate representation (x′μ)d
μ=0 of x′ with respect to the
basis {f μ}d
μ=0 is given as follows:
x′0 = x0,
x′j = −xj, j = 1, . . . , d.
In terms of the metric matrix g, we have
x′
μ =

ν=0
gμνxν.
In what follows, we use the symbol xμ for x′μ:
xμ :=
d

ν=0
gμνxν.
(8.35)
Then, as is seen from the above discussion, (xμ)d
μ= is the coordinate rep-
resentation of the dual element ι(x) of x ∈M1+d with respect to the basis
{f μ}d
μ=0. This clariﬁes the meaning of the change from (xμ)μ to (xμ)μ.
The matrix g is invertible with g−1 = g. We denote by gμν the (μ, ν)-
component of g−1:
g−1 = (gμν)μ,ν=0,...,d.
Then,

(8.36)
where δρ
μ = δμρ is the Kronecker delta: δρ
μ = 1 for μ = ρ and δρ
μ = 0 for
μ ̸= ρ.
It follows from (8.35) and (8.36) that
xμ =
d

ν=0
gμνxν.
We also have
xy =


μ=o
xμyμ =

xμyμ,
x, y ∈M1+d.
We deﬁne the symbol x2 by
x2 := xx = (x0)2 −
d

(xj)2.
In what follows, for notational simplicity, we use Einstein’s convention
for the summation of object T ρλ···
μν··· with an index which appears only once

at the upper index part and the lower one, respectively. For example,
T μλ···
μν··· :=
d

μ=0
T μλ···
μν··· .
Following this convention, we have
xy = xμyμ,
xμ = gμνxν,
xμ = gμνxν
etc.
The non-zero points in M1+d are classiﬁed into three categories:
A point x ∈M1+d is said to be time-like (resp., space-like) if x2 > 0
(resp., x2 < 0).
A point x ∈M1+d is said to be light-like if x2 = 0 and x ̸= 0.
The set {x ∈M1+d|x2 = 0} is called the light cone.
8.10.2
Lorentz group
A linear mapping Λ : M1+d →M1+d satisfying
(Λx)(Λy) = xy,
x, y ∈M1+d
(8.37)
is called a Lorentz transformation on M1+d. Namely, a Lorentz transfor-
mation is a linear mapping on M1+d which preserves the Minkowski inner
product. It follows that Λ is injective and hence bijective.
We denote by L (1+d)) the set of Lorentz transformations on M1+d.
It is easy to see that L (1+d) is a group. The group L (1+d) is called the
(1 + d)-dimensional Lorentz group.
In general, for a linear mapping T on M1+d, we denote by T μ
ν (μ, ν = 0,
1, . . . , d) the (μ, ν)-component of the matrix representation of T with
respect to the standard basis {eμ}d
μ=0:
T eμ = T ν
μeν,
μ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
where Einstein’s convention on the summation of ν is used. Hence,
(T x)μ = T μ
ν xν,
x ∈M1+d, μ = 0, 1, . . . , d.
In what follows, concerning Lorentz transformations Λ, we work with
matrix representations with respect to the standard basis {eμ}d
μ=0 and iden-
tify Λ with its matrix representation (Λμ
ν). Then, condition(8.37) is equiv-
alent to the equation
tΛgΛ = g,
(8.38)
where tΛ denotes the transposed matrix of Λ.
552
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Multiplying (8.38) by Λg from the left and by Λ−1g from the right and
using (8.34), we obtain
Λg tΛ = g.
(8.39)
This means that tΛ also is a Lorentz transformation, i.e., tΛ ∈L (1+d).
Taking the determinant of both sides on(8.38) and using det g ̸= 0 and
det tΛ = det Λ, we obtain det Λ2 = 1. Hence,
det Λ = ±1.
Also, computing the (0, 0)-component of both sides on (8.38) gives the
equation

Among these subsets, only L ↑

L ↑

An element of L ↑

(i) If x0 > 0, then (Λx)0 > 0.
(ii) If x0 < 0, then (Λx)0 < 0.

Dual operators on (M1+d)∗
For a linear operator T on M1+d, the linear operator T ′ : (M1+d)∗→
(M1+d)∗deﬁned by
(T ′k)(x) := k(T x),
k ∈(M1+d)∗, x ∈M1+d
is called the dual operator of T . It is easy to see that
T ′k = T μ
ν kμf ν,
k = kμf μ ∈(M1+d)∗.
Hence,
(T ′k)ν = T μ
ν kμ.
It follows from (8.39) that, for all Λ ∈L (1+d),
(Λ′k)(Λ′l) = kl,
k, l ∈(M1+d)∗,
i.e., Λ′ is a Lorentz transformation on (M1+d)∗.
8.10.4
The Lie algebra of L ↑
+
It is easy to see that L ↑
+ is a linear Lie group (see Appendix F). Hence, its
Lie algebra exists. We denote it by l↑
+:
l↑
+ := {X ∈M1+d(R)|etX ∈L ↑
+, ∀t ∈R}.
An explicit form of this Lie algebra is given as follows:
Proposition 8.6.
l↑
+ = {X ∈M1+d(R)|tXg + gX = 0}.
(8.41)
In particular,
dim l↑
+ = d(d + 1)
2
.
(8.42)
Proof. Let X ∈l↑
+. Then, for all s ∈R, t(esX)gesX = g, which is equivalent
to estXgesX = g, ∀s ∈R. Diﬀerentiating both sides in s at s = 0, we have
tXg + gX = 0.
(8.43)
Conversely, suppose that X ∈M1+d(R) satisﬁes (8.43). Then, tX =
g(−X)g. Hence, using g2 = I1+d, we have, for all s ∈R,
estX = esg(−X)g = ge−sXg,
General Theory of Quantum Fields
555
This implies that estXgesX = g. Since estX = t(esX), it follows that esX ∈
L ↑
+. Thus, (8.41) holds.
Let X ∈l↑
+ and Y := gX. Then, by (8.43), Y = −tY . This means that
Y is anti-symmetric. Hence, Y = 
0≤μ<ν≤d Y μ
ν eν
μ, where Y μ
ν is the (μ, ν)
component of Y and eν
μ (μ < ν) is the anti-symmetric matrix satisfying
(eν

β = δμαδνβ −δμβδνα (α, β = 0, . . . , d). Hence,
X = gY =

0≤μ<ν≤d
Y μ

μ.
It is easy to see that geν
μ ∈l↑
+ and {geν

dent matrices. The cardinal number of this set is d(d + 1)/2. Thus, (8.42)
follows.

Poincar´e group
The set
P(1+d) := {(a, Λ)|a ∈R1+d, Λ ∈L (1+d)}
is a group with the following operation:
(a2, Λ2)(a1, Λ1) := (a2 + Λ2a1, Λ2Λ1),
a1, a2 ∈R1+d, Λ1, Λ2 ∈L (1+d).
The group P(1+d) is called the (1 + d)-dimensional Poincar´e group.
Each element (a, Λ) ∈P(1+d) can be regarded as a transformation on
M1+d deﬁned by
(a, Λ)x := Λx + a,
x ∈M1+d.
Under this identiﬁcation, the product of two elements in P(1+d) is the
composition of those as transformations and P(1+d) is a transformation
group on M1+d.
The group P(1+d) is a topological group such that the convergence of
a sequence is deﬁned as follows. A sequence {(an, Λn)}n in P(1+d) is said
to converge to (a, Λ) ∈P(1+d) if limn→∞|an −a| = and limn→∞(Λn)μ
ν =
Λμ
ν, μ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d. In this case, we write limn→∞(an, Λn) = (a, Λ).
It is easy to see that the subset
P↑

of P(1+d) is a subgroup of P(1+d). This subgroup is called the (1 + d)-

Axioms for Relativistic QFT
Schematically, a translation covariant QFT discussed in Section 8.9 becomes
a relativistic QFT (RQFT) if it acquires a structure emerging from the
principles of special relativity in accordance with quantum mechanics. As
is well known, the special theory of relativity is based on the following two
principles:
(R.1) Invariance of light speed c (causality).
(R.2) Poincar´e covariance (special relativity).
By incorporating these principles into the idea of QFT in a suitable manner,
one obtains a set of axioms for an RQFT. Four kinds of axioms for an RQFT
have been proposed so far: (i) the G˚arding–Wightman axioms (1954);
(ii) the Wightman axioms (1956); (iii) the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms
(1973); (iv) the Nelson axioms (1973). The ﬁrst two formulate minimum
properties that an RQFT on the four-dimensional Minkowski space-time M4
(more generally the (1+d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time M1+d) should
satisfy, while the last two are concerned with formulations of a Euclidean
QFT, a QFT on the Euclidean space R4, which is heuristically obtained
by an analytic continuation of an RQFT on M4 to a region consisting of
points in C4 whose time component is purely imaginary. In the following,
we outline these axioms.
Remark 8.9. The axioms for relativistic quantum ﬁelds presented in the
following are of trial nature because, in the case of four-dimensional space-
time, the existence of a non-trivial model satisfying the axioms has not
yet been shown, where a “non-trivial model” means a quantum ﬁeld model
which describes interactions of elementary particles; it is not equivalent
to a (generalized) free quantum ﬁeld (for free quantum ﬁelds, see Chapters
10–12; it is shown that relativistic free quantum ﬁelds obey the axioms). To
show the existence of a non-trivial relativistic quantum ﬁeld model on the
four-dimensional space-time remains a very diﬃcult open problem, which is
closely related to one of the millennium problems (Jaﬀe and Witten, 2000).
20Strictly, L (1+d) (resp., R1+d) is isomorphic to {(0, Λ)|Λ ∈L (1+d)} (resp., {(a, I)|a ∈
R1+d}) under the mapping Λ 	→(0, Λ) (resp., a 	→(a, I)).
General Theory of Quantum Fields
557
In what follows, we use the physical unit system where c = 1 unless
otherwise stated.
8.11.1
The G˚arding–Wightman axioms
We ﬁrst discuss the G˚ading–Wightman axioms. There may be many kinds
of quantum ﬁelds corresponding to those of classical ﬁelds. For simplicity,
we restrict ourselves to the case of a neutral (Hermitian) quantum scalar
ﬁeld on the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time M1+d.21
A neutral (or Hermitian) quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on M1+d is
deﬁned to be a quintuple (H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) consisting of a separable inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space H , a strongly continuous unitary representation
U of P↑
+ on H , an operator-valued distribution φ on R1+d with values in
L(H ), a common domain D of φ and a unit vector Ψ0 ∈H , satisfying the
following (GW.1)–(GW.5):
(GW.1) (quantum ﬁeld)
(a) For each f ∈S (R1+d), φ(f)D ⊂D.
(b) (Hermiticity) If f ∈S (R1+d) is a real-valued, then φ(f) ↾D
is a symmetric operator.
The operator-valued distribution φ is called the neutral (Hermi-
tian) quantum scalar ﬁeld.
(GW.2) (Poincar´e covariance)
(U.1) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+, U(a, Λ)D ⊂D.
(U.2) For all f ∈S (R1+d) and (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
U(a, Λ)φ(f)U(a, Λ)−1 = φ(f(a,Λ))
on D,
(8.44)
where
f(a,Λ)(x) = f(Λ−1(x −a)),
x ∈R1+d.
(8.45)
(U.3) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
U(a, Λ)Ψ0 = Ψ0.
(8.46)
The vector Ψ0 is called the vacuum. Such a vector Ψ0 is
unique up to constant multiples, i.e., if a vector Ψ ∈H
satisﬁes U(a, Λ)Ψ = Ψ for all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+, then Ψ = αΨ0
for some α ∈C.
21For the axioms of a more general quantum ﬁeld, see, for example, Bogoliubov et al.
(1975) and Streater and Wightman (1964).

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that R1+d ∋a →U(a, I) is a strongly continuous unitary
representation of the translation group R1+d. Hence, by Lemma 8.2, there
exists a (1 + d)-tuple P := (Pμ)d
μ=0 of strongly commuting self-adjoint
operators on H such that
U(a, I) = eia0P0/ℏeia1P1/ℏ· · · eiadPd/ℏ,
a ∈R1+d.
(8.47)
The operator vector P is called the energy–momentum operator of the
QFT under consideration.
Since the (1 + d)-tuple P is strongly commuting, it follows from a gen-
eral theory of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators that Pμ and Pν
commute:
[Pμ, Pν] = 0
(8.48)
on D(PμPν) ∩D(PνPμ).
The energy–momentum space in the special theory of relativity is
given by
M1+d
p
:= {ℏk|k ∈(M1+d)∗}.
(GW.3) (spectral condition) Let
V+ := {p = (p0, p1, . . . , pd) ∈M1+d
p
|p0 > 0, p2 > 0},
(8.49)
called the forward light cone. Then, the joint spectrum σJ(P)
is a subset of V + (the closure of V+):
σJ(P) ⊂V + = {p ∈M1+d
p
|p0 ≥0, p2 ≥0}.
(8.50)
(GW.4) (locality or microscopic causality) If supp f (the support of
f ∈S (R1+d)) is space-like separated from supp g (g ∈S (R1+d)),
i.e., (x −y)2 < 0 for all x ∈supp f and y ∈supp g, then φ(f) and
φ(g) commute on D:

The properties (GW.1)–(GW.5) are called the G˚arding–Wightman
axioms.
Some comments on these axioms may be in order.
Property (GW.1)-(a) is just a property that a quantum ﬁeld should
posses (see Deﬁnition 8.2(QF.1)), while (GW.1)-(b) reﬂects the specialty
that the quantum ﬁeld is neutral. A neutral (classical or quantum) ﬁeld
means that it has no electric charge. A neutral classical scalar ﬁeld on
M1+d is given by a real-valued function φcl on M1+d. Hence, for all f ∈
SR(R1+d) is a real number. Corresponding to this fact, the expectation
value of a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld φ(f) in any physical state should be
a real number if f is real-valued. The subspace D in the G˚ading–Wightman
axioms is interpreted to be included in the subspace of physical states.
Hence, for all Ψ ∈D and f ∈SR(R1+d), ⟨Ψ, φ(f)Ψ⟩should be a real
number. This is equivalent to (GW.1)-(b).
A proper Poincar´e transformation (a, Λ), which is a transformation on
the space-time M1+d, should accompany a transformation on the state
space. This transformation is U(a, Λ). The unitarity of U(a, Λ) is due to the
requirement that such a transformation on the state space should preserve
the transition probability between any two states and Wigner’s theorem.22
Since U is a representation of P↑
+, it obeys the following composition law:
for all (a1, Λ1), (a2, Λ2) ∈P↑
+,
U(a2, Λ2)U(a1, Λ1) = U(Λ2a1 + a2, Λ2Λ1).
(8.51)
In particular, for all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
U(a, Λ)−1 = U(−Λ−1a, Λ−1).
(8.52)
Property (U.2) is a transformation law of the quantum ﬁeld φ under
proper Poincar´e transformations. The deﬁnition of the function f(a,Λ) given
by (8.45) is obviously extended to any function f ∈L2(R1+d). It is easy to
see that, for all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈L2(R1+d), f(a,Λ) is in L2(R1+d) and
∥f(a,Λ)∥= ∥f∥.
22Wigner’s theorem. Let H be a Hilbert space with dim H ≥2 and T be a mapping
on H such that, for all Φ, Ψ ∈H , | ⟨TΦ, TΨ⟩| = | ⟨Φ, Ψ⟩|. Then, there exists a linear
isometry TL on H (i.e., TL is a linear operator on H satisfying ∥TLΨ∥= ∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈
H ) or an anti-linear isometry TA (i.e., TA is an anti-linear operator on H satisfying
∥TAΨ∥= ∥Ψ∥, Ψ ∈H ) such that TΨ = eiθL(Ψ)TLΨ, Ψ ∈H or TΨ = eiθA(Ψ)TAΨ, Ψ ∈
H , where θL(Ψ) and θA(Ψ) are real constants which may depend on Ψ. A detailed proof
of this theorem is given in Arai and Ezawa (1999b) (cf. also Wigner, 1959).

Hence, the mapping u(a, Λ) on L2(R1+d) deﬁned by
u(a, Λ)f := f(a,Λ),
f ∈L2(R1+d)
(8.53)
is a linear isometry. For all (a2, Λ2), (a1, Λ1) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈L2(R1+d),
(u(a2, Λ2)u(a1, Λ1)f)(x) = (u(a1, Λ1)f)(Λ−1
2 (x −a2))
= f(Λ−1
1 (Λ−1
2 (x −a2) −a1))
= f((Λ2Λ1)−1(x −Λ2a1 −a2))
= f(Λ2a1+a2,Λ2Λ1)(x)
= (u((a2, Λ2)(a1, Λ1))f)(x),
a.e. x ∈R1+d.
Hence,
u(a2, Λ2)u(a1, Λ1) = u((a2, Λ2)(a1, Λ1)).
(8.54)
In particular,
u(a, Λ)u(−Λ−1a, Λ−1) = u(0, I) = I.
Hence, u(a, Λ) is surjective. Thus, u(a, Λ) is unitary.
By using the Lebesgue dominated convergence, one can easily show that,
for all f, g ∈C∞
0 (R1+d), the mapping (a, Λ) →⟨g, u(a, Λ)f⟩is continuous.
Hence, by Lemma 8.3, u(a, Λ) is strongly continuous in (a, Λ). Thus, we
arrive at the following theorem.
Theorem 8.4. The mapping u : P↑
+ →U(L2(R1+d)) : (a, Λ) →u(a, Λ) is
a strongly continuous unitary representation of P↑
+.
We note that, if fn, f ∈S (R1+d), fn
S→f (n →∞), then u(a, Λ)fn
S→
u(a, Λ)f (n →∞). Hence, the mapping u(a, Λ)′φ : S (R1+d) →L(H )
deﬁned by by
(u(a, Λ)′φ)(f) := φ(u(a, Λ)f),
f ∈S (R1+d)
is an operator-valued distribution. We call u(a, Λ)′φ the Poincar´e
transform of the quantum ﬁeld φ associated with (a, Λ).
Equation (8.44) is written
U(a, Λ)φU(a, Λ)−1 = u(a, Λ)′φ
on D.
(8.55)
By
this
property,
the
quantum
ﬁeld
φ
is
said
to
be
unitarily
implementable under the action of the proper Poincar´e group P↑
+.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
561
In terms of the operator-valued distribution kernel φ(x) of φ (φ(f) =

R1+d φ(x)f(x)dx), (8.44) is symbolically written as
U(a, Λ)φ(x)U(a, Λ)−1 = φ(Λx + a).
In a physical picture, a vacuum is supposed to be a state in which there
exist no observed elementary particles or no visible matters in the space-
time. In such a state, every point in the space-time would be on an equal
footing. Therefore, a vacuum should be a state invariant under all proper
Poincar´e transformations. This requirement is (U.3).
The joint spectrum σJ(P) of P is interpreted as the set of measured
values of the energy–momentum P. In the special theory of relativity, an
energy–momentum vector of a “normal” motion (time-like motion) is time-
like and the energy component is non-negative. Hence, (8.50) is a natural
condition.
In the special theory of relativity, space-like separated points are
causally independent. Hence, ﬁeld measurements should be mutually
independent if they are made at those points. On the other hand, the
independence of quantum mechanical observables is expressed as their com-
mutativity. This is a physical meaning of property (GW.4).
Physically, a quantum ﬁeld is supposed to have the function that creates
elementary particles from the vacuum or annihilates them into the vacuum.
Each state may be described by a conﬁguration of elementary particles
whose number is ﬁnite, and such a state may be given by a ﬁnite linear
combination of the vacuum Ψ0 and vectors of the form φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ψ0
(n ∈N, fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n). This is a physical picture behind
property (GW.5).
Let us see some consequences of (GW.1)–(GW.5).
Proposition
8.7. The vacuum Ψ0 is a simultaneous eigenvector of
P0, . . . , Pd with eigenvalue 0:
PμΨ0 = 0,
μ = 0, 1, . . . , d.
In particular, 0 ∈σJ(P).
Proof. By (8.46) and (8.47), we have for all t ∈R and μ = 0, 1, . . . , d,
eitPμΨ0 = Ψ0.
By considering the strong diﬀerentiation of both sides at t = 0, one sees
that Ψ0 ∈D(Pμ) and PμΨ0 = 0.

Proposition 8.8. P0 ≥|P |.
Proof. This follows from (GW.3) and an application of Proposition 8.4
with γ = 1.
□
Since each point of the joint spectrum σJ(P) of P is considered a point
in (M1+d)∗, it is natural to assume that, for any Lorentz transformation
Λ on M1+d, the operator vector P is transformed by the dual operator Λ′
as Λ′P:
Λ′P = (Λμ
0Pμ, Λμ
1Pμ, . . . , Λμ
dPμ).
Since P is strongly commuting, (Λ′P)μ = Λν
μPν is essentially self-adjoint
for all μ = 0, 1, . . . , d. Moreover, the (1 + d)-tuple
Λ′P := (Λμ
0Pμ, Λμ
1Pμ, . . . , Λμ
dPμ)
of self-adjoint operators is strongly commuting, where Λμ
νPμ denotes the
closure of Λμ
νPμ.
The strong commutativity of P implies that, for all a ∈R1+d,
aP := a0P0 +
d

j=1
ajPj
is essentially self-adjoint and
eiaP /ℏ= eia0P0/ℏeia1P1/ℏ· · · eiadPd/ℏ.
Hence,
U(a, I) = eiaP /ℏ.
(8.56)
Proposition 8.9 (Transformation law of the energy–momentum).
For all Λ ∈L ↑
+,
U(0, Λ)PμU(0, Λ)−1 = (Λ′P)μ,
μ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
(8.57)
Proof. For all a ∈R1+d, we have by (8.51) and (8.52)
U(0, Λ)U(a, I)U(0, Λ)−1 = U(Λa, I).
Hence,
U(0, Λ)eiaP /ℏU(0, Λ)−1 = ei(Λa)P /ℏ= eia(Λ′P )/ℏ.
Taking a = teμ ∈R1+d, t ∈R, one has
U(0, Λ)eitPμ/ℏU(0, Λ)−1 = eit(Λ′P )μ/ℏ.
Hence, (8.57) follows.
□
As a corollary to Proposition 8.9, we ﬁnd the following natural fact.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
563
Corollary 8.2 (Lorentz invariance of the energy–momentum spec-
trum). For all Λ ∈L ↑
+,
Λ′σJ(P) = σJ(P).
(8.58)
Proof. Let S = Λ′σJ(P). Then, it is easy to see that S is a closed set. By
the spectral mapping theorem,
σJ(Λ′P) = S = S.
(8.59)
On the other hand, by (8.57),
σJ(Λ′P) = σJ(P),
which, together with (8.59), gives (8.58).
□
One can derive the equations of motion for the quantum ﬁeld φ.
Theorem 8.5. Suppose that the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) D ⊂D(Pμ), μ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
(ii) For all f ∈S (R1+d) and μ = 0, 1, . . . , d, PμD ⊂D(φ(f)).
(iii) For all Ψ ∈D and μ = 0, 1 . . . , d, f ∈S (R1+d), the H -valued
function: R ∋t →φ(f)eitPμΨ is strongly continuous.
Then, for all Ψ ∈D, f ∈S (R1+d) and n ∈N,
Dn
μφ(f)Ψ = i
ℏ[Pμ, Dn−1
μ
φ(f)]Ψ
(μ = 0, 1, . . . , d).
(8.60)
Proof. Putting Λ = I in (8.44) and a = teμ (t ∈R), we have
eitPμ/ℏφ(f)e−itPμ/ℏ= φ(f(teμ,I)),
on D.
Hence, one can apply Theorem 8.1 to obtain the desired result.

Angular momentum
In this section, we show how the concept of angular momentum appears in
the framework of the G˚arding–Wightman axioms. For each Λ ∈L ↑
+, we set
U0(Λ) := U(0, Λ).
Then, U0 : L ↑
+ →U(H ) is a strongly continuous unitary representation of
L ↑
+.

For 1 ≤j, k ≤d, j ̸= k, and θ ∈R, a mapping Rjk(θ) on M1+d is
deﬁned by
(Rjk(θ)x)μ := xμ,
μ ̸= j, k,
(Rjk(θ)x)j := xj cos θ −xk sin θ,
(Rjk(θ)x)k := xj sin θ + xk cos θ,
x ∈M1+d.
It is easy to see that Rjk(θ) ∈L ↑
+. Geometrically, Rjk(θ) means the
Euclidean rotation of angle θ around the origin in the xj-xk plane.
Also, we deﬁne R0j(θ) ∈L ↑
+ (j = 1, . . . , d) by
(R0j(θ)x)μ := xμ,
μ ̸= 0, j,
(R0j(θ)x)0 := x0 cosh θ + xj sinh θ,
(R0j(θ)x)j := x0 sinh θ + xj cosh θ.
Geometrically, R0j(θ) means the Lorentz rotation of angle θ around the
origin in the x0-xj plane. Also, we introduce Rj0(θ) ∈L ↑
+ by
Rj0(θ) := R0j(−θ),
θ ∈R.
As is easily seen, for each (μ, ν) (μ, ν = 0, 1, . . ., d, μ ̸= ν), {Rμν(θ)}θ∈R
is a subgroup of L ↑
+ and {U0(Rμν(θ))}θ∈R is a strongly continuous
one-parameter unitary group on H . Hence, by Stone’s theorem, there exists
a unique self-adjoint operator M μν on H such that
U0(Rμν(θ)) = e−iθMμν/ℏ.
(8.61)
We set
M μμ := 0,
, μ = 0, 1, . . ., d.
Since Rμν(−θ) = Rνμ(θ), it follows that
M μν = −M νμ,
μ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d, μ ̸= ν.
The d(d + 1)/2-tuple (M μν)0≤μ<ν≤d is called the angular momentum
of the quantum ﬁeld φ. In particular, we call (M jk)1≤j<k≤d the orbital
angular momentum.
We ﬁrst note the following important fact.
Theorem 8.6 (Conservation of the orbital angular momentum).
For all t ∈R and j, k = 1, . . . , d,
eitP0/ℏM jke−itP0/ℏ= M jk.
(8.62)
General Theory of Quantum Fields
565
Proof. Let θ ∈R. Then,
eitP0/ℏe−iθMjk/ℏe−itP0/ℏ= U(te0, I)U(0, Rjk(θ))U(−te0, I)
= U(te0 −tRjk(θ)e0, Rjk(θ)).
But Rjk(θ)e0 = e0. Hence, the last operator in the above equation is equal
to U(0, Rjk(θ)) = e−iθMjk/ℏ. Therefore,
eitP0/ℏe−iθMjk/ℏe−itP0/ℏ= e−iθMjk/ℏ.
By this equation and the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we
obtain (8.62).
□
Let us calculate commutation relations among M μν’s and P μ’s (recall
that P μ := gμνPν).
Theorem 8.7. Suppose that D ⊂D(M μνPλ) ∩D(PλM μν) for all μ, ν, λ =
0, . . . , d. Then, for all μ, ν, λ = 0, . . . , d,
[M μν, P λ] = −iℏ(gμλP ν −gνλP μ)
(8.63)
on D.
Proof. Let Φ, Ψ ∈D and j, k, ℓ= 1, . . . .d, μ = 0, 1, . . ., d. Then, by (8.57),
we have

eiθMjk/ℏΦ, PμΨ

=

Rjk(θ)ν
μPνΦ, e−iθMjk/ℏΨ

(8.64)
The following equations follow from the deﬁnition of Rμν(θ):
Rjk(θ)ν
0PνΦ = P 0Φ,
Rjk(θ)ν
ℓPνΦ = δj
ℓ[(cos θ)PjΦ + sin θ)PkΦ] + δk
ℓ[(−sin θ)PjΦ + (cos θ)PkΦ].
By diﬀerentiating both sides of (8.64) in θ at θ = 0, we see that
	
M jkΦ, P0Ψ

P0Φ, M jkΨ

.
Hence, it follows that
[M jk, P0]Ψ = 0,
[M jk, Pℓ]Ψ = iℏ(δj
ℓPk −δk
ℓPj)Ψ.
Similarly, one can show that
[M 0j, Pℓ]Ψ = 0 (ℓ̸= j),
[M 0j, P0]Ψ = iℏPjΨ,
[M 0j, Pj]Ψ = iℏP0Ψ.

Rewriting these equations with P0 = P 0 and Pj = −P j (j = 1, . . . , d), we
obtain (8.63).
□
The (0, j) component M 0j of the angular momentum is not conserved;
however, its time development obeys a simple, beautiful formula.
Theorem 8.8. Suppose that the same assumption as in Theorem 8.7 holds
and that D ∩E (P0) is dense in H , where E (P0) is the set of entire analytic
vectors of P0 (see Section 1.7). Then, for all t ∈R and j = 1, . . . , d,
eitP0/ℏM 0je−itP0/ℏ= M 0j + tPj

With regard to commutation relations of M μν’s, we give only a remark.
For r ∈N, we denote by Mr(K) the set of r ×r matrices whose components
are elements of K (K = R or C). For all μ, ν = 0, 1, . . . , d, we deﬁne mμν ∈
M1+d(C) by
(mμν)α
β := iℏ(gμαδν
β −gναδμ
β),
μ, ν = 0, . . . , d.
Then, it is easy to see that, for all θ ∈R,
Rμν(θ) = e−iθmμν/ℏ.
(8.68)
By direct computations, one can show that the following commutation
relations hold:
[mμν, mρσ] = −iℏ(gμρmνσ −gμσmνρ −gνρmμσ + gνσmμρ).
By (8.68), −imμν ∈l↑
+. It is easy to see that the set {−imμν|0 ≤μ < ν ≤d}
is linearly independent and the number of elements in it is d(d+1)/2. Thus,
it is a basis of l↑
+.
By (8.61) and (8.68), we have
U0(e−iθmμν) = e−iθMμν,
μ, ν = 0, . . . , d, θ ∈R.
Hence, by analogy with the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional representations
of Lie algebras, the correspondence imμν →iM μν may give an inﬁnite-
dimensional representation of the Lie algebra l↑
+. But it would need more
conditions for U0(Λ) to justify this scheme in general since each M μν may be
unbounded. If the scheme is justiﬁed, then one can expect that M μν’s satisfy
the same commutation relation as those of mμν’s on a suitable subspace:
[M μν, M ρσ] = −iℏ(gμρM νσ −gμσM νρ −gνρM μσ + gνσM μρ)
(8.69)
on a subspace. For a structure related to to this aspect, see Problem 8.17.

and
(8.69)

that

Lie algebra is called the Poincar´e algebra associated with M1+d.
8.11.3
The Wightman axioms
Let (H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) be a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on M1+d.
Then, by a general theory in Section 8.5, for each n ∈N, there exists a
568
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
unique tempered distribution Wn on (R1+d)n such that, for all f1, . . . , fn ∈
S (R1+d),
Wn(f1 × · · · × fn) = ⟨Ψ0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ψ0⟩.
(8.70)
The
tempered
distribution
Wn
is
called
the
n-point
Wightman
distribution for the quantum ﬁeld φ. The distribution kernel of Wn is
denoted Wn(x1, . . . , xn):
Wn(f) =

Wn(x1, . . . , xn)f(x1, . . . , xn)dx1 · · · dxn.
In terms of the operator-valued distribution kernel φ(x) of the quantum
ﬁeld φ, Wn(x1, . . . , xn) is written as
Wn(x1, . . . , xn) = ⟨Ψ0, φ(x1) · · · φ(xn)Ψ0⟩
as a symbolical expression for (8.70).
One can characterize a QFT in terms of the Wightman distributions
instead of using a Hilbert space and operators acting in it. This approach
leads one to the following axioms (Wightman, 1956; Streater and Wight-
man, 1964).
A neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory is a sequence {Wn ∈

Rough correspondences.
These axioms are called the Wightman axioms.
It is not so diﬃcult to show that the Wightman distributions {Wn}∞
n=0
(W0 := 1) deﬁned by (8.70) in a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory
(H , U, φ, D, Ψ0) satisfy the Wightman axioms.23
Conversely, for each sequence {Wn}∞
n=0 with Wn
∈
S ′(R(1+d)n)
satisfying the Wightman axioms, there exists a quintuple (H , U, φ, D, Ψ0)
obeying the G˚arding–Wightman axioms such that its Wightman distribu-
tions are equal to {Wn}∞
n=0, and it is unique up to unitary equivalents. This
fact is called Wightman’s reconstruction theorem.24
In this way, it is shown that the G˚arding–Wightman axioms and the
Wightman axioms are equivalent (Fig. 8.1).
Remark 8.10. In general, a tempered distribution T ∈S ′(R(1+d)n) is said
to be Poincar´e (resp., Lorentz) invariant if, for all f ∈S (R(1+d)n) and
(a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ (resp., Λ ∈L ↑
+), T (f) = T (f(a,Λ)) (resp., T (f) = T (f(0,Λ))).
In terms of distribution kernel T (x1, . . . , xn) of T , the Poincar´e invariance
of T is symbolically expressed as
T (Λx1 + a, . . . , Λxn + a) = T (x1, . . . , xn).
The case a = 0 in this equation gives the symbolical expression of the
Lorentz invariance of T . Axiom (W.2) is rephrased as follows: for all n ≥1,
Wn is Poincar´e invariant.
23See, for example, Streater and Wightman (1964) and Ezawa and Arai (2023).

8.11.4
The Osterwalder–Schrader axioms
The theory of functions of complex variables tells us that the essence of a
function may become apparent only after all its possible analytic contin-
uations are found. This idea may be applicable to tempered distributions
too. From this point of view, one is naturally led to consider the analytic
continuations of the Wightman distributions and may expect to obtain a
set of axioms for a QFT in terms of objects diﬀerent from the Wightman
distributions. In the following, we describe how this procedure is done and
what kind of axioms appear.
One can show by using the relativistic invariance, the spectral condition
and the locality in the Wightman axioms that each Wightman distribution
Wn can be analytically continued to a function on the subset
{((it1, x1), . . . , (itn, xn))|tj ∈R, xj ∈Rd, (itj, xj) ̸= (itk, xk)
j ̸= k, j, k = 1, . . . , n}
in C(1+d)n := C1+d×· · ·×C1+d (the n direct product of C1+d).25 This subset
is called the non-coincident Euclidean region. As is seen, the analytic
continuation makes the time components of space-time points purely imag-
inary ones. For this reason, it is called the analytic continuation to purely
imaginary times. On the level of the space-time, this analytic continua-
tion changes the Minkowski space-time metric to the Euclidean one. In
this sense, the analytic continuation is called the Euclideanization of the
Wightman distributions. Let us denote the analytic continuation of Wn by
the same symbol Wn and introduce a sequence {Sn}∞
n=0 of functions as
follows: S0 := 1 and
Sn((t1, x1), . . . (tn, xn)) := Wn((it1, x1), . . . , (itn, xn))
It is shown that, for all n ∈N, Sn is a real analytic function on the domain
En := {(y1, . . . , yn) ∈R(1+d)n|yj ̸= yk, j ̸= k, j, k = 1, . . . , n}.
(8.73)
The function Sn is called the n-point Schwinger function or n-point
Euclidean Green’s function.
25For the details, see, for example, Ezawa and Arai (2023), Chapter 2, Osterwalder and
Schrader (1973, 1975), and Simon (1974).

From the Wightman axioms to the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms.
The properties of the Wightman distributions have their correspondents
in the Schwinger functions. To describe them, we need some notations.
Let
S̸=(R(1+d)n) := {f ∈S (R(1+d)n)|for all multi-indices α, ∂αf = 0 on
the hypersurface yj = yk(j ̸= k, j, k = 1, . . . , n)}.
We consider the space S̸=(R(1+d)n) as a topological space with respect
to the relative topology in S (R(1+d)n) and denote by S ′
̸=(R(1+d)n) the set
of continuous linear functionals on S̸=(R(1+d)n). We also introduce a subset
of S̸=(R(1+d)n):
S+(R(1+d)n) :=
&
f ∈S̸=(R(1+d)n)|supp f ⊂(R(1+d)n)+
'
,
where
(R(1+d)n)+ := {((t1, x1), . . . , (tn, xn)) ∈R(1+d)n|0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tn}.
One can prove that the sequence {Sn}∞
n=0 of the Schwinger functions
has the following properties (OS.1)–(OS.5)26 (Fig. 8.2):
(OS.1) (temperedness and Hermiticity) For each n ≥1, Sn ∈S ′
̸=(R(1+d)n)
and, for all f ∈S̸=(R(1+d)n)
Sn(f) = Sn(θf †),
where
Sn(f) =

Sn(y1, . . . , yn)f(y1, . . . , yn)dy1 · · · dyn,
(θf)((t1, x1), . . . , (tn, xn)) = f((−t1, x1), . . . , (−tn, xn)),
and f † is deﬁned by (8.71).
26For proofs, see, for example, Osterwalder and Schrader (1973, 1975) and Simon (1974).

(1 + d)-dimensional Euclidean rotation group27)
Sn(f) = Sn(f(a,R)),
f ∈S̸=(R(1+d)n),
where
f(a,R)(y1, . . . , yn) := f(R−1(y1 −a), . . . , R−1(yn −a)),
y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈R(1+d)n.

where, for each t ∈R,
(Ttg)(y1, . . . , ym) := g(y1 −(t, 0), . . . , ym −(t, 0)),
y = (y1, . . . , ym) ∈R(1+d)m.
From an axiomatic point of view, forgetting about the Wightman
axioms, one may deﬁne a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory as a sequence
{Sn}∞
n=0 satisfying (OS.1)–(OS.5). In this scheme, properties (OS.1)–(OS.5)
are called the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms, and for any sequence
{Sn}∞
n=0 satisfying (OS.1)–(OS.5), Sn’s are called the Schwinger func-
tions. Then, it is natural to ask if the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms imply
the Wightman axioms or the G˚arding–Wightman axioms. In fact, this
involves some subtle problems technically. If the condition of the tem-
peredness in (OS.1) is strengthened a little, then one can construct a
sequence of tempered distributions satisfying the Wightman axioms from a

sequence of Schwinger functions obeying the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms
(Osterwalder–Schrader’s reconstruction theorem28) (Fig. 8.3).
The Osterwalder–Schrader axioms are not only interesting from purely
theoretical points of view but also useful for constructing relativistic
quantum ﬁeld models. This is suggested by the following considerations.
The equation of motion which a relativistic quantum ﬁeld (φr)s
r=1 on
the Minkowski space-time M1+d obeys is of the following form in many
cases:

□+
mc
ℏ
2
φr(x) = Fr(φ1(x), . . . , φs(x), ∇φ1(x), . . . , ∇φs(x)),
x ∈M1+d, where c is the light speed (we have recovered it here),
□:= DμDμ = D2

(8.74)
is the (1 + d)-dimensional d’Alembertian with the distributional partial
diﬀerential operators Dμ, μ = 0, . . . , d (the operator □in this sense is
27SO(1 + d) := {R ∈M1+d(R)| tRR = I, det R = 1}.
28For the details, see Osterwalder and Schrader (1973, 1975) and Simon (1974).
Zinoviev (1995) discovered a revised version of the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms which
is completely equivalent to the Wightman axioms.

called the generalized (1 + d)-dimensional d’Alembertian),
∇:= (D0, D1, . . . , Dd),
m ≥0 is a constant and Fr is a function on Rs × R(1+d)s. These equations
are of hyperbolic type.
If one replaces the time component x0 in x ∈M1+d by the purely
imaginary time ix0, then one sees that the partial diﬀerential operator
□+ (mc/ℏ)2 changes to −Δ + (mc/ℏ)2, where Δ = d
μ=0 D2
μ is the
generalized (1 + d)-dimensional Laplacian. Hence, schematically, by the
analytic continuation to the non-coincident Euclidean region, the quan-
tum ﬁeld φr on the Minkowski space-time may “metamorphose” into a
ﬁeld φr,E on the Euclidean space R1+d, which is symbolically expressed as
φr,E(x) = φr(ix0, x) (x = (x0, x) ∈R × Rd), and the ﬁeld equation takes
the form

−Δ +
mc
ℏ
2
φr,E(x) = Gr(x),
where Gr is deﬁned via the analytic continuation of Fr. These equations
are of elliptic type. As is well known, elliptic-type equations may be more
tractable than hyperbolic ones in some respects. Thus, the analytic con-
tinuation to purely imaginary times may make analysis easier equation-
theoretically.
Moreover, the following aspect is also suggestive. For any two points
xE = (ix0, x) and yE = (iy0, y) which have a purely imaginary time com-
ponent, respectively, their Minkowski metric is −(x0 −y0)2 −|x −y|2 < 0
and hence, in the symbolical sense, “xE and yE are space-like separated.”
Therefore, applying schematically (heuristically) the microscopic causality
to this case, one has that [φr(xE), φr′(yE)] = 0 (r, r′ = 1, . . . , s). Thus, if
a ﬁeld (φr,E)s
r=1 on the Euclidean space R1+d exists, then it is expected
that they form a set of commuting operators. Needless to say, commutative
operators may be more tractable than non-commutative ones.
8.12
Euclidean Quantum Fields
As remarked in a heuristic way at the end of the previous section, it
is expected that, in the analytic continuation of the G˚arding–Wightman
theory to the non-coincident Euclidean region, a quantum ﬁeld on the
Minkowski space-time may metamorphose into an operator-valued distribu-
tion whose values are mutually commutative. One may call such a commu-
tative operator-valued distribution a Euclidean quantum ﬁeld if it exists.
576
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In this connection, the vacuum in the G˚arding–Wightman theory should
have a corresponding non-zero vector in the Hilbert space in which the
Euclidean quantum ﬁeld acts. If such a vector exists, we call it a Euclidean
vacuum. In this scheme, it is expected that the Schwinger functions are
generated by the expectation values of the Euclidean quantum ﬁelds with
respect to a Euclidean vacuum. At least it is natural as a working hypoth-
esis to suppose that such a class of Schwinger functions may exist. These
heuristic considerations leads one to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.4. Let H be a Hilbert space. A Euclidean quantum ﬁeld
(or a Euclidean ﬁeld simply) on R1+d is an operator-valued distribution
ϕE on R1+d with values in L(H ) and common domain D, satisfying the
following (EF.1)–(EF.3):
(EF.1) (cyclicity) There exists a unit vector Φ0 in D such that, for all n ∈N
and fj ∈S (R1+d) (j = 1, . . . , n), Φ0 ∈D(ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)) and
the subspace
D0 := span
(
Φ0, ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)Φ0|n ∈N, fj ∈S (R1+d),
j = 1, . . . , n
)
is dense in H and D0 ⊂D.
(EF.2) (commutativity) For all f, g ∈S (R1+d), [ϕE(f), ϕE(g)] = 0 on D0.
(EF.3) (Euclidean invariance) Let n ∈N and fj ∈S (R1+d) (j = 1, . . . , n).
Then, for all (a, R) ∈R1+d × SO(1 + d),

Φ0, ϕE(f1(a,R)) · · · ϕE(fn(a,R))Φ0

= ⟨Φ0, ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)Φ0⟩,
where fj(a,R)(x) := fj(R−1(x −a)), x ∈R1+d.
The vector Φ0 is called a Euclidean vacuum.
Let ϕE be a Euclidean ﬁeld on R1+d as above. Then, by the Schwartz
nuclear theorem, for each n ∈N, there exists a unique tempered distribution
Sn ∈S ′(R1+d) such that
Sn(f1×· · ·×fn) = ⟨Φ0, ϕE(f1) · · · ϕE(fn)Φ0⟩,
fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n.
We call Sn’s the Schwinger distributions of the Euclidean ﬁeld ϕE.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
577
Since a Euclidean ﬁeld is commutative in the sense of (EF.2), there
may be the case where H = L2(X, dμ) with a probability measure space
(X, Σ, μ), ϕE(f) (f ∈SR(R1+d)) is a random variable on (X, Σ, μ) and
Φ0 = 1. In this case, ϕE is an example of a generalized random process,
or a random distribution, on R1+d. Nelson formulated a set of axioms for
such a Euclidean quantum ﬁeld from which an RQFT on the Minkowski
space-time is reconstructed. These axioms are called the Nelson axioms.
For the details, see Nelson (1973) and Simon (1974).
8.13
PCT Theorem
Concerning space-time symmetries, we have so far considered only
continuous symmetries, i.e., symmetries deﬁned by continuous groups, such
as time- translation, space translations, space rotations and proper Lorentz
transformations. However, besides continuous symmetries, there are phys-
ically important discrete symmetries which are described by ﬁnite groups
consisting of transformations on the space-time. In this section, we brieﬂy
describe them and give a remark on an important theorem.
We deﬁne the mappings I0 and Is on R1+d as follows:
I0(x) := (−x0, x),
(8.75)
Is(x) := (x0, −x),
x = (x0, x) ∈R1+d.
(8.76)
The mappings I0 and Is are, respectively, called the time reversal (or
time inversion) and the space inversion. Note that
(I0Is)(x) = −x = (IsI0)(x),
x ∈R1+d.
Hence,
I0Is = IsI0
and I0Is gives the space-time inversion: R1+d ∋x →−x. It is easy to
see that I0 and Is are bijective linear mappings with
I2
0 = I,
I2
s = I.
In particular,
I−1
0
= I0,
I−1
s
= Is.
Hence,
{I, I0}, {I, Is}
and
{I, I0, Is, I0Is}
become
discrete
(ﬁnite)
groups.
578
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The mappings I0 and Is naturally induce the mappings ut and us on
S (R1+d) as follows:
(utf)(x) := f(I0x),
(usf)(x) := f(Isx),
f ∈S (R1+d), x ∈R1+d.
It follows that u# (# = t, s) is bijective and
u2
# = I,
utus = usut,
u−1
# = u#.
The operators ut and us are, respectively, called the time-reversal
operator and the parity operator on S (R1+d). It is easy to see that
the eigenvalues of u# are ±1. The eigenvalues ±1 of us are called parities.
Let ϕ = (ϕr)N
r=1 be the N-component quantum ﬁeld acting in a Hilbert
space F and
ϕ(f) =
N

r=1
ϕr(fr),
f = (fr)N
r=1 ∈⊕NS (R1+d).
We deﬁne
ϕ(#)(f) := ϕ(u#f),
ϕ(st)(f) := ϕ(usutf),
where u#f := (u#fr)N
r=1. The ﬁeld ϕ(t) and ϕ(s) are, respectively, called
the time reversal of ϕ and the space inversion of ϕ. Hence, ϕ(st) may
be called the T P-transform of ϕ (T means “time reversal” and P means
“parity”).
In terms of operator-valued distribution kernels ϕ(#)
r
(x)) of ϕ(#)
r
, we
have
ϕ(t)
r (x) = ϕr(−x0, x),
ϕ(s)
r (x) = ϕr(x0, −x),
ϕ(st)
r
(x) = ϕr(−x).
In an axiomatic framework of relativistic QFT, one can show that, under
a suitable assumption, there exist an involution C on ⊕NS (R1+d) and an
anti-unitary operator Θ on F such that
Θϕ(f)Θ−1 = ϕ(Cusutf)∗,
f ∈⊕NS (R1+d),
(8.77)
where usutf := (usutfr)N
r=1. This type of transformation law is called PCT
theorem (or CPT theorem), which tells us that the CPT transform
ϕ(Cusutf)∗of ϕ is anti-unitarily implementable.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
579
Remark 8.11. In non-relativistic QFT, the PCT theorem may take a
slightly diﬀerent form from (8.77). See Section 9.4.3.
8.14
Haag’s Theorem
In this section, we describe an important theorem in axiomatic QFT. We
denote by O(3) the three-dimensional orthogonal group (see Appendix F,
Example F.1(iii)). The direct product
E (3) := R3 × O(3) := {(a, R)|a ∈R3, R ∈O(3)}
of R3 and O(3) becomes a topological group with product topology and the
product operation deﬁned by
(a2, R2)(a1, R1) := (a2 + R2a1, R2R1),
a1, a2 ∈R3, R1, R2 ∈O(3).
The unit element of E (3) is (0, I) and the inverse element of (a, R) ∈E (3) is
(−R−1a, R−1). The group E (3) is called the three-dimensional Euclidean
group.
The direct product
E (3)
+
:= R3 × SO(3)
of R3 and the three-dimensional rotation group SO(3) (see Appendix F,
Example F.1(iv)) forms a subgroup of E (3). It is called the three-
dimensional restricted Euclidean group.
For each (a, R) ∈E (3)
+ , one can deﬁne an operator v(a, R) on L2(R3) by
(v(a, R)f)(x) := f(a,R)(x) := f(R−1(x −a)),
a.e. x ∈R3.
(8.78)
In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 8.4, one can prove that the
mapping v : E (3)
+
→U(L2(R3)) : (a, R) →v(a, R) is a strongly continuous
unitary representation of E (3)
+ .
The following theorem is concerned with a canonical QFT with a
Euclidean symmetry.
Theorem 8.9 (Haag’s Theorem). Let
(Fb(L2(R3)), D,
H, {ϕ(t, ·),
π(t, ·)}t∈R) be a canonical QFT on R4 (see Section 8.6) realized on the boson
Fock space Fb(L2(R3)) such that the Fock vacuum ΩL2(R3) is in D. Suppose
that the following hold:
580
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(i) (existence and uniqueness of ground state) The Hamiltonian H is
bounded from below and has a unique ground state (vacuum) Ψ0 with
∥Ψ0∥= 1:
HΨ0 = E0(H)Ψ0,
where E0(H) is deﬁned by (4.50).
(ii) (Euclidean covariance of time-t ﬁelds) There is a strongly continuous
unitary representation {U(a, R)|(a, R) ∈E (3)
+ } of E (3)
+
on Fb(L2(R3))
such that, for all (a, R) ∈E (3)
+ , t ∈R, and f ∈S (Rd),
U(a, R)ϕ(t, f)U(a, R)−1 = ϕ(t, v(a, R)f),
U(a, R)π(t, f)U(a, R)−1 = π(t, v(a, R)f),
(iii) (Euclidean invariance of ground state) For all (a, R)
∈
E (3)
+ ,
U(a, R)Ψ0 = Ψ0.
(iv) (uniqueness of Euclidean invariant state) If a non-zero vector Ψ ∈
Fb(L2(R3)) satisﬁes U(a, R)Ψ = Ψ for all (a, R) ∈E (3)
+ , then Ψ =
λΨ0 with a constant λ ∈C.
(v) For all (a, R) ∈E (3)
+
and f ∈L2(R3), U(a, R)D ⊂D(a(f))∩D(a(f)∗),
where a(f) (resp., a(f)∗) is the annihilation (resp., creation) operator
on Fb(L2(R3)).
(vi) (time-zero ﬁelds) There exists a non-negative and injective self-adjoint
operator T on L2(R3) such that
S (R3) ⊂D(T 1/2) ∩D(T −1/2),
T ±1/2SR(R3) ⊂SR(R3),
T ±1/2v(a, R)f = v(a, R)T ±1/2f,

(8.79)
and, for all f ∈SR(R3),
ϕ(0, f) = φF(T −1/2f),
π(0, g) = πF(T 1/2g),
where φF (·) is the operator deﬁned by (5.156) with HC = L2
R(R3).
Then, Ψ0 = γΩL2(R3) with a constant γ ∈C. Namely, the ground state of
H is the Fock vacuum up to constant multiples.
Proof. Since (0, I) is the unit element of E (3)
+ , we have U(0, I) = I. Hence,
condition (v) implies that, for all f ∈L2(R3), D ⊂D(a(f)) ∩D(a(f)∗). By
General Theory of Quantum Fields
581
condition (vi), we have for all f ∈SR(R3)
ϕ(0, T 1/2f) =
1
√
2(a(f)∗+ a(f)),
π(0, T −1/2f) =
i
√
2(a(f)∗−a(f))
on D. Hence,
a(f) =
1
√
2(ϕ(0, T 1/2f) + iπ(0, T −1/2f))
on D.
Let (a, R) ∈E (3)
+ . Then, by condition (v), U(a, R)ΩL2(R3) ∈D(a(f)) ∩
D(a(f)∗) and
a(f)U(a, R)ΩL2(R3) =
1
√
2(ϕ(0, T 1/2f) + iπ(0, T −1/2f))U(a, R)ΩL2(R3).
Using condition (ii) with t = 0 and (8.79), one can show that the right-
hand side is equal to U(a, R)a(v(a, R)−1f)ΩL2(R3) = 0, where we have used
(5.54). Hence, a(f)U(a, R)ΩL2(R3) = 0. This extends to all f ∈S (R3) by
the anti-linearity of a(f) in f. Hence, by Proposition 5.7, there exists a
constant c(a, R) ∈C such that
U(a, R)ΩL2(R3) = c(a, R)ΩL2(R3).
(8.80)
Since U(0, I) = I, we have
c(0, I) = 1.
(8.81)
Equation (8.80) implies that {c(a, R)|(a, R) ∈E (3)
+ } is a one-dimensional
unitary representation of E (3)
+ . In particular, {c(0, R)|R ∈SO(3)} is a
one-dimensional unitary representation of SO(3). Hence, by a well known
fact on unitary representation of SO(3), there is a constant c0 ∈C (|c0| = 1)
such that, for all R ∈SO(3), c(0, R) = c0. Hence, c(a, R) = c(a, I)c(0, R) =
c0c(a, I). We also have c(a, R) = c(0, R)c(R−1a, I) = c0c(R−1a, I). There-
fore, c(R−1a, I) = c(a, I) for all a ∈R3, R ∈SO(3). This implies that
there exists a function w : [0, ∞) →C such that c(a, I) = w(|a|). Since
{c(a, I)|a ∈R3} is a one-dimensional unitary representation of the trans-
lation group R3, it follows that, for all a, b ∈R3, w(|a|)w(|b|) = w(|a+b|).
Taking b = −a, we obtain w(|a|)2 = 1. Hence, c(a, I) = ±1. Since c(a, I)
is continuous on R3 and R3 is connected, it follows that c(a, I) = 1 for all
a ∈R3 or c(a, I) = −1 for all a ∈R3. But the latter is excluded because

of (8.81). Hence, U(a, R)ΩL2(R3) = c0ΩL2(R3). Since U(0, I) = I, it follows
that c0 = 1. Thus, U(a, R)ΩL2(R3) = ΩL2(R3). Then, by condition (iv),
ΩL2(R3) = λΨ0 for some constant λ ∈C (|λ| = 1). Letting γ = 1/λ, we
obtain the desired result.

Example 8.8. An example of the self-adjoint operator T in Theorem 8.9

where Lm is the non-negative self-adjoint operator deﬁned by (1.93) with

we obtain

Thus, T = Tα satisﬁes (8.79). Note that the rotation invariance (8.83) of
the function Em plays an essential role.
Theorem 8.9 has an important implication in constructing a non-trivial
QFT model. Let (Fb(L2(R3)), D, H, {ϕ(t, ·), π(t, ·)}t∈R) be as in Theorem
8.9 and H0 be deﬁned by (8.24) with d = 3. By (5.190), the Fock vacuum
Ω0 := ΩL2(R3) is a ground state of H0. Suppose that H ̸= H0 and
H = H0 + HI
with a symmetric operator HI on Fb(L2(R3)). This means that H is
obtained by a perturbation of H0. Physically, the perturbation operator

583
HI is expected to describe an interaction of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ(t, f). But
it follows from the conclusion of Theorem 8.9 that HI does not change
the ground state Ω0 of the unperturbed system. In general, an interaction
of a quantum ﬁeld is expected to change the ground state of a quantum
ﬁeld system. From this point of view, the result just mentioned indicates
the ineﬀectiveness of the interaction HI. Indeed, we have for all t ∈R and
f1, . . . , fm, g1, . . . , gn ∈SR(R3) (m, n ∈N),
⟨Ψ0, ϕ(t, f1) · · · ϕ(t, fm)π(t, g1) · · · π(t, gn)Ψ0⟩

= ⟨Ω0, ϕfree(t, f1) · · · ϕfree(t, fm)πfree(t, g1) · · · πfree(t, gn)Ω0⟩.
where ϕfree(t, f) and πfree(t, g) (f, g ∈SR(R3)) are the free quantum ﬁelds
deﬁned in Section 8.7 with d = 3. The formula shows that the VEVs of
products of time-t quantum ﬁelds ϕ(t, ·) and π(t, ·) coincide with those of
time-t free quantum ﬁelds ϕfree(t, ·) and πfree(t, ·) (but this may not be the
case for the VEVs of the products of unequal-time quantum ﬁelds).
As is seen from the proof of Theorem 8.9, the problem comes
from the choice of the time-zero ﬁelds, i.e., the Fock representation
{φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈SR(R3)} of Heisenberg CCR is chosen. There-
fore, Theorem 8.9 suggests that, in constructing a non-trivial model with
Euclidean symmetry in the sense of (i)–(iv) in Theorem 8.9, one should
use as the time-zero ﬁelds a representation of Heisenberg CCR inequiva-
lent to the Fock one. In fact, representations of CCR inequivalent to Fock
ones appear in many places in quantum ﬁeld theory to describe physically
interesting situations. We shall discuss an example of such a structure in
Chapter 13 (see also Arai, 2020).
Remark 8.12. If the quantum ﬁeld ϕ in Theorem 8.9 is a relativistic scalar
ﬁeld and T = L1/2
m , then it follows from an application of a general theorem
(Streater and Wightman, 1964, Theorem 4-15) that ϕ is a free ﬁeld of mass
m (see Chapter 10). There is a relativistic version of Theorem 8.9, which is
also called Haag’s theorem and implies that, in relativistic QFT, the so-
called interaction picture is impossible, i.e., the total Hamiltonian cannot
be written as the sum of the free (unperturbed) part and the interaction

Scattering Theory and Spectral Analysis
8.15.1
Introduction
In an axiomatic QFT in which the basic concept is a quantum ﬁeld (e.g.,
the G˚arding–Wightman axioms), no particle picture is given in advance.
Hence, one needs to derive a particle picture from the axioms. Physically,
one has a particle picture by observing free elementary particles. In scat-
tering phenomena of elementary particles, free elementary particles coming
from a long distance at time t ≈−∞are scattered by a target and then
ﬂy away into the distance at t ≈+∞, appearing as free elementary parti-
cles again.29 From these experimental facts, one infers that there exists an
asymptotic ﬁeld φin(t, x) (resp., φout(t, x)) describing free particles, which is
formally deﬁned as an asymptotic limit (in a suitable sense) limt→−∞φ(t, x)
(resp., limt→+∞φ(t, x)) of an interacting quantum ﬁeld φ(t, x), satisfying
φin/out(t, x) = eitH/ℏφin/out(0, x)e−itH/ℏ, where H is the Hamiltonian of
the quantum system under consideration, and the free Klein–Gordon
equation


φin/out(t, x) = 0
in the sense of operator-valued distribution if φ(t, x) is a quantum scalar
ﬁeld, with m ≥0 being a constant.30 The quantum ﬁelds φin/out are called
free quantum Klein–Gordon ﬁelds, and it is shown that they describe free
particles of mass m indeed (the details will be given in Chapter 10). How-
ever, in the case of the asymptotic ﬁelds φin/out, m has to be identiﬁed with
the observed mass of a particle (not the “bare mass”31). With this particle
29In the intermediate space-time where the interactions among the elementary particles
and the target occur, a particle picture makes no sense.
30We continue to use the physical unit system where c = 1, unless otherwise stated.
31A “bare mass” means the mass of a particle before being in the interaction with
quantum ﬁelds (it may be somewhat a ﬁctitious notion). In the conventional picture
in physical QFT, the bare mass of a particle may change through an interaction with
a quantum ﬁeld to give an observed mass. It is known, however, that in some models

picture, one can ask the transition probability of an initial particle state
(in-state) at t = −∞to a ﬁnal particle state (out-state) at t = +∞, which
may be compared with experiments on scattering phenomena of elementary
particles. Such transition probabilities can be described in a uniﬁed way by
a unitary operator called a scattering operator, or a scattering matrix.
A scattering theory in the framework of the G˚arding–Wightman axioms
is established and called the Haag–Ruelle scattering theory. Concern-
ing this theory, we refer the reader to textbooks on mathematical QFT
(e.g., Araki, 1993, Chapter 4; Bogoliubov et al., 1975, Chapter 4; Glimm
and Jaﬀe, 1987, Chapters 13–14; Haag, 1996, Section II.4; Reed and Simon,
1979, Chapter XI, Section 16). See also Buchholz (1978). In this section, we
present another type of scattering theory which can be applied to models
in non-relativistic QFT, including those in relativistic QFT with cutoﬀs
(see Chapter 14). From a mathematical point of view, it gives a method for
the spectral analysis of a class of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces of
Fock space type.
8.15.2
Asymptotic annihilation and creation operators
For simplicity, we consider only a Bose ﬁeld theory in an abstract frame-
work. Let H be a Hilbert space and Fb(H ) be the boson Fock space over
H (see Chapter 5). As a free ﬁeld Hamiltonian, we take
H0 := dΓb(T ),
the boson second quantization of a non-negative and injective self-adjoint
operator T on H (see Section 5.3.2). Let H be a self-adjoint operator on
Fb(H ), denoting the total Hamiltonian of a system of an interacting Bose
ﬁeld. Then, a symmetric operator H1 on Fb(H ) such that H −H0 ⊂H1
(i.e., D(H) ∩D(H0) ⊂D(H1) and HΨ = (H0 + H1)Ψ, Ψ ∈D(H) ∩D(H0))
describes an interaction of the quantum system under consideration. We
assume the following:
(H.1) (i) H is bounded from below and (ii) D(H) ⊂D(H0).
Condition (H.1)(i) implies that the inﬁmum of the spectrum of H
E0 := inf σ(H)
in relativistic QFT, observed masses are found to be divergent in formal perturbation
theory. This is the reason why it is diﬃcult to construct a model in relativistic QFT (see
Remark 8.9). In the physical QFT, one avoids such diﬃculties by a prescription called
“renormalization,” but this is not a mathematical solution.
586
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
is ﬁnite and the energy-shifted Hamiltonian
*H := H −E0,
is non-negative. By condition (H.1)(ii) and Lemma 1.9, H0( *H + 1)−1 is
bounded. Hence, there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that
∥H0Ψ∥≤C1∥( *H + 1)Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H).
It follows from this fact and an application of Theorem 1.34 that D( *H1/2) ⊂
D(H1/2
0
) and there exists a constant C2 > 0 such that
∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥≤C2∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D( *H1/2),
(8.84)
where we have used the fact that, for all α > 0,
∥Ψ∥≤∥( *H + 1)αΨ∥, Ψ ∈D( *Hα).
(8.85)
We denote by A(f) the annihilation operator on Fb(H ) with test vector
f ∈H (see Chapter 5).
Lemma 8.5. For all f ∈D(T −1/2), D( *H1/2) ⊂D(A(f)#) and, for all
Ψ ∈D( *H1/2),
∥A(f)Ψ∥≤C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
(8.86)
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥≤(C2∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥f∥)∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
(8.87)
Proof. By Theorem 5.17, D(H1/2
0
) ⊂D(A(f)#) and
∥A(f)Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥.
Hence, D( *H1/2) ⊂D(A(f)#) and (8.84) yields (8.86). Similarly, we have
∥A(f)∗Ψ∥≤∥T −1/2f∥∥H1/2
0
Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥Ψ∥
≤∥T −1/2f∥C2∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥+ ∥f∥∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
where we have used (8.85) with α = 1/2. Hence, (8.87) holds.

In the rest of this section, for notational simplicity, we use the physical
unit system where ℏ= 1 and c = 1.
For each (f, t) ∈D(T −1/2) × R, we deﬁne
At(f)# := eitHe−itH0A(f)#eitH0e−itH,
where # = ∅, ∗. Recall that D(H1/2
0
) ⊂D(A(f)#) (Theorem 5.17). For any
self-adjoint operator Q on a Hilbert space and all α > 0, e−itQD(|Q|α) =
D(|Q|α), ∀t ∈R. Hence, it follows that
D( *H1/2) ⊂D(At(f)#).
By Lemma 5.21, for all f ∈H and t ∈R, the operator equality
e−itH0A(f)#eitH0 = A(e−itT f)#
holds. Hence,
At(f)# = eitHA(e−itT f)#e−itH.
(8.88)
Lemma 8.6. For all f ∈D(T −1/2), D( *H1/2) ⊂D(At(f)#) and, for all
Ψ ∈D( *H1/2),
∥At(f)Ψ∥≤C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
(8.89)
∥At(f)∗Ψ∥≤(C2∥T −1/2f∥+ ∥f∥)∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥.

Proof. By Lemma 8.5 and (8.88),
∥At(f)Ψ∥= ∥A(e−itT f)e−itHΨ∥
≤C2∥T −1/2e−itT f∥∥( *H + 1)1/2e−itHΨ∥.
By the functional calculus, we have
∥T −1/2e−itT f∥= ∥T −1/2f∥,
∥( *H + 1)1/2e−itHΨ∥= ∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
Hence, (8.89) follows. Similarly, one can prove (8.90).

Under assumptions (H.1) and (H.2), for each f ∈D(T −1/2), one can

In particular, A±,0(f)∗are densely deﬁned. Hence, they are closable. We
denote the closures by A±(f):
A±(f) := A±,0(f).
It follows that D( *H1/2) ⊂D(A±(f)) ∩D(A±(f)∗) and
A±(f)∗= A±,0(f)∗⊃A†

Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case where Ψ = A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH (n ≥0,

By the absolute continuity (see Theorem C.2 in Appendix C), we have
limt→±∞
	
e−itT f, fj

= 0. Hence, limt→±∞A(e−itT f)Ψ = 0. Note that
the subspace algebraically spanned by all vectors of the form Ψ is D0 :=
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). The subspace D0 is a core of H0 and hence of H1/2
0
. Therefore,
for any Ψ ∈D(H1/2

∥Φ −Ψ∥< ε,
∥H1/2
0
Φ −H1/2
0
Ψ∥< ε.
By using the triangle inequality, we have

Since limt→±∞∥A(e−itT f)Φ∥= 0 as just shown above, it follows that
lim sup
t→±∞∥A(e−itT f)Ψ∥≤ε∥T −1/2f∥.
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, we obtain limt→±∞∥A(e−itT f)Ψ∥= 0. Thus,
(8.91) follows.

that limt→±∞A(e−itT f)ΨE = 0. We have e−itHΨE = e−itEΨE, t ∈R.
Hence,

Thus, (8.93) is derived.

Proposition 8.10 shows that (eitH, A±(f)) have the same commutation
property as (eitH0, A(f)).
Since the strong convergence of vectors implies their norm convergence,
Lemma 8.6 immediately yields the following lemma.

on D( *H3/2). In particular,
HA±(f) = A±(f)H −A±(T f),
(8.98)
HA±(f)∗= A±(f)∗H + A±(T f)∗
(8.99)
on D( *H3/2).
Proof. Let Ψ ∈D( *H3/2) and Φ ∈D(H). Then, by (8.93),
	
e−itHΦ, A+(f)Ψ

= R(t),
R(t) :=
	
A+(eitT f)∗Φ, eitHΨ

.
The left-hand side is diﬀerentiable in t with
d
dt
	
e−itHΦ, A+(f)Ψ

=
	
e−itH(−iH)Φ, A+(f)Ψ

.
Hence, R(t) is also diﬀerentiable in t. Using the preceding lemma, we have
dR(t)
dt
=
	
A+(iT eitT f)∗Φ, eitHΨ

+
	
A+(eitT f)∗Φ, eitHiHΨ

.
Hence, it follows that
	
HΦ, eitHA+(f)Ψ

= −
	
Φ, A+(T eitT f)eitHΨ

+
	
Φ, A+(eitT f)HeitHΨ

,
where we have used the fact that eitHΨ ∈D(H3/2) ⊂D( *H1/2) and
HeitHΨ ⊂D( *H1/2). Since this holds for all Φ ∈D(H), it follows that
eitHA+(f)Ψ ∈D(H∗) = D(H), which means that A+(f) maps D( *H3/2) to
D(H), and (8.96) holds. Similarly, one can prove (8.97). Putting t = 0 in
(8.96) and (8.97), we obtain (8.98) and (8.99).
□
Theorem 8.11 shows that (H, A±(f)) obey the same commutation
relations as those of (H0, A(f)) (see Theorem 5.18).
A consequence of the mapping property of A±(f)# in Theorem 8.11 is
given in the following theorem.
592
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 8.12 (CCR). Let f, g ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T ). Then, the following
commutation relations hold on D( *H3/2):
[A±(f), A±(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩,
(8.100)
[A±(f), A±(g)] = 0,
[A±(f)∗, A±(g)∗] = 0.
(8.101)
Proof. Let Φ ∈D( *H1/2) and Ψ ∈D( *H3/2). Then, under the preceding
theorem, A±(f)#Ψ ∈D(H) ⊂D(A±(g)#). By Theorem 5.19, D(H) ⊂
D(H0) ⊂D(A(e−itT f)#A(e−itT g)#) for all t ∈R. Hence, the following
calculations are mathematically meaningful:
⟨Φ, A±(f)A±(g)∗Ψ⟩=
lim
t→±∞⟨At(f)∗Φ, At(g)∗Ψ⟩
=
lim

= ⟨f, g⟩⟨Φ, Ψ⟩+ ⟨A±(g)Φ, A±(f)Ψ⟩
= ⟨Φ, (A±(g)∗A±(f) + ⟨f, g⟩)Ψ⟩.
Hence, (8.100) follows. Similarly, one can prove (8.101).
□
We set
DT := D(T −1/2) ∩C∞(T ).
Lemma 8.10. For each f ∈DT , A±(f)# leave C∞(H) invariant.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈C∞(H). Then, Ψ ∈D( *H3/2). Hence, by Theorem 8.11,
A±(f)Ψ ∈D(H) and
HA±(f)Ψ = A±(f)HΨ −A±(T f)Ψ.
Since HΨ ∈C∞(H) ⊂D( *H3/2), the vector on the right-hand side is in
D(H) by Theorem 8.11 again. Hence, HA±(f)Ψ ∈D(H) (i.e., Ψ ∈D(H2))
and
H2A±(f)Ψ = HA±(f)HΨ −HA±(T f)Ψ.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
593
Next, one applies the same argument to each vector on the right-hand
side to conclude that the vector on the right-hand side is in D(H). Hence,
H2A±(f)Ψ ∈D(H), i.e., A±(f)Ψ ∈D(H3) and
H3A±(f)Ψ = H2A±(f)HΨ −H2A±(T f)Ψ.
Repeating this argument, one can show that, for all n ∈N, A±(f)Ψ ∈
D(Hn).
Thus,
A±(f)Ψ
∈
C∞(H).
Similarly,
one
can
show
that
A±(f)∗C∞(H) ⊂C∞(H).
□
The following theorem immediately follows from Theorem 8.12 and
Lemma 8.10.
Theorem 8.13. The triplets (Fb(H ), C∞(H), {A±(f)|f ∈DT }) are rep-
resentations of the CCR over DT .32
8.15.5
Scattering operator
We assume the following (H.3) and (H.4) in addition to (H.1) and (H.2):
(H.3) (existence of a ground state) H has a ground state Ψ0:
HΨ0 = E0Ψ0,
∥Ψ0∥= 1.
(H.4) The operator T is absolutely continuous.
Under these assumptions, we have by Theorem 8.10
A±(f)Ψ0 = 0,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
Since Ψ0 ∈C∞(H), it follows from Lemma 8.10 that, for all n ∈N
and fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n), Ψ0 ∈D(A±(f1)# · · · A±(fn)#). Hence, we can
deﬁne vectors
Ψ±(f1, . . . , fn) := A±(f1)∗· · · A±(fn)∗Ψ0.
Physically, the vector Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn) (resp., Ψ+(f1, . . . , fn)) is interpreted as
an asymptotically observed n particle state at t = −∞(resp., +∞), called
an in-state (resp., out-state). In this way, a particle picture emerges in
the interacting system under consideration.
32See Section 5.23.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let
D0,± := span {Ψ0, Ψ±(f1, . . . , fn)|n ∈N, fj ∈DT , j = 1, . . . , n}
and
Fout
in := D0,±.
Then, by Theorem 8.13, (Fout
in , D0,±, {A±(f)|f ∈DT }, Ψ0) are cyclic rep-
resentations of the CCR over DT . Hence, by Theorem 5.44, there exists a
unitary operator U± : Fb(H ) →Fout
in such that U±ΩH = Ψ0 and, for all
f ∈DT , A±(f) = U±A(f)U −1
±
on D0,±. Hence, the operator
S := U+U −1
−
is a unitary operator from Fin onto Fout, satisfying
SΨ0 = Ψ0
(8.102)
and
A+(f) = SA−(f)S−1
(8.103)
on D0,+. We call the operator S the scattering operator, or the scatter-
ing matrix.
It follows (8.102) and (8.103) that, for all n ∈N and fj ∈DT
(j = 1, . . . , n),
SΨ−(f1, . . . , fn) = Ψ+(f1, . . . , fn).
Proposition 8.11. For all t ∈R, eitHF in
out = F in
out and
e−itHS = Se−itH
(8.104)
on Fin.
Proof. Let n ∈N and fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n). Then, by Proposition 8.10,
e−itHΨ±(f1, . . . , fn) = e−itE0Ψ±(e−itT f1, . . . , e−itT fn),
where we have used the fact that e−itHΨ0 = e−itE0Ψ0. Hence, e−itHD0,± ⊂
D0,±. This implies that e−itHD0,± = D0,±. Since D0.± are dense in Fout
in ,
it follows that e−itHFout
in = Fout
in . We have
e−itHSΨ−(f1, . . . , fn) = e−itE0Ψ+(e−itT f1, . . . , e−itT fn)
= Se−itE0Ψ−(e−itT f1, . . . , e−itT fn)
= Se−itHΨ−(f1, . . . , fn).
General Theory of Quantum Fields
595
Hence, e−itHS = Se−itH on D0,−. Since e−itHS and Se−itH are bounded
operators on Fin, (8.104) follows.
□
If Fin = Fout = Fb(H ), then the quantum system is said to be
asymptotically complete. In this case, S is a unitary operator on
Fb(H ).
If F∞:= Fin = Fout, then the quantum system is said to have weak
asymptotic completeness. In this case, S is a unitary operator on F∞.
Since, for each in-state Ψ ∈F∞with ∥Ψ∥= 1, SΨ is a state vector at
t = +∞(an out-state) determined causally under no measurements in
the meantime, | ⟨Φ, SΨ⟩|2 is interpreted as the transition probability from
Ψ at t = −∞to Φ at t = +∞(i.e., the probability that the state Φ is
found under a measurement at t = +∞). In particular, | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 gives the
probability that the system is found to be in the same state Ψ as the initial
one under a measurement at t = +∞. Based on this, one says that there is
no scattering with respect to the asymptotic initial state Ψ at t = −∞if
| ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 = 1. We say that there is no scattering if, for all unit vectors
Ψ ∈F∞, | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 = 1. Hence, if | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 < 1 for some unit vector
Ψ ∈F∞, then there is a scattering. “No scattering” is characterized as
follows.
Proposition 8.12. There is no scattering if and only if S = eiθ for some
θ ∈R.
Proof. The “if part” is obvious. So, we prove the “only if part.” Sup-
pose that there is no scattering. Then, for all unit vectors Ψ ∈F∞,
| ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 = 1. Let Ψ ∈F∞with ∥Ψ∥= 1 and P be the orthogonal
projection onto the one-dimensional space HΨ := {αΨ|α ∈C}. Then, we
have SΨ = ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩Ψ + (1 −P)SΨ. Hence,
∥SΨ∥2 = | ⟨Ψ, SΨ⟩|2 + ∥(1 −P)SΨ∥2 = 1 + ∥(1 −P))SΨ∥2.
Since S is unitary, ∥SΨ∥2 = ∥Ψ∥2 = 1. Hence, ∥(1 −P)SΨ∥2 = 0. This
implies that SΨ ∈HΨ. Hence, SΨ = α(Ψ)Ψ with a constant α(Ψ) such that
|α(Ψ)| = 1. It follows that, for all non-zero vectors Φ ∈F∞, SΦ = β(Φ)Φ
with β := α(Φ/∥Φ∥). Using the linearity of S, one can show that β(Φ) is
independent of Φ. Hence, there exists a constant θ ∈R such that β(Φ) = eiθ.
Thus, S = eiθ.

Spectrum of H
We continue to assume (H.1)–(H.4). Then, we have the orthogonal decom-
position
Fb(H ) = Fin/out ⊕F ⊥
in/out.
Since e−itHFin/out = Fin/out for all t ∈R, it follows that H is reduced
by Fin/out and hence by F ⊥
in/out too. We denote the reduced part of H to
Fin/out and F ⊥
in/out by Hin/out and H⊥
in/out, respectively.
Lemma 8.11. The following operator equalities hold:
U −1
−(Hin −E0)U−= H0,
(8.105)
U −1
+ (Hout −E0)U+ = H0.
(8.106)
Proof. Let fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N) and t ∈R. Then,
U −1
−eit(Hin−E0)Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn) = U −1
−Ψ−(eitT f1, . . . , eitT fn)
= A(eitT f1)∗· · · A(eitT fn)∗ΩH
= eitH0A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH
= eitH0U −1
−Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn).
Since D0,−is dense in Fin and U −1
−eit(Hin−E0) and eitH0U −1
−
are bounded,
it follows that U −1
−eit(Hin−E0) = eitH0U −1
−, i.e.,
U −1
−eit(Hin−E0)U−= eitH0.
By the unitary covariance of functional calculus, the left-hand side is equal
to exp(itU −1
−(Hin−E0)U−). Hence, (8.105) follows. Similarly, one can prove
(8.106).
□
For a subset X of R and a constant c ∈R, we deﬁne a subset X + c ⊂
R by
X + c := {x + c|x ∈X}.
Theorem 8.14. Assume (H.1)–(H.4). Then,
(i) σ(Hin/out) = σ(H0) + E0.
(ii) σ(H0) + E0 ⊂σ(H).
(iii) If Fin = Fb(H ) or Fout = Fb(H ), then σ(H) = σ(H0) + E0 and
the ground state of H is unique.
General Theory of Quantum Fields
597
Proof. (i) By the preceding lemma and the unitary invariance of spectrum,
we have σ(Hin/out −E0) = σ(H0). Hence, the desired result follows.
(ii) Since H is a direct sum operator, we have
σ(H) = σ(Hin/out) ∪σ(H⊥
in/out).
Hence, σ(H) ⊃σ(Hin/out) = σ(H0) + E0.
(iii) Let Fin = Fb(H ). Then, F ⊥
in = {0} and hence Hin = H. Thus,
by (ii), σ(H) = σ(H0) + E0. Suppose that Φ0 ̸= 0 were a ground state
of H. Without loss of generality, we can assume that Ψ0 ⊥Φ0. Then, by
A−(f)Φ0 = 0 for all f ∈D(T −1/2), we have ⟨Ψ−(f1, . . . , fn), Φ0⟩= 0 for all
fj ∈DT (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N). Hence, Φ0 ∈D⊥
0,−= {0}. Thus Φ0 = 0. But
this is a contradiction, Thus, the ground state of H is unique. Similarly,
one can prove the stated fact in the case Fout = Fb(H ) too.
□
Remark 8.13. Theorem 8.14(iii) shows that, if σ(H0) + E0 ⫋σ(H), then
Fin/out ̸= Fb(H ). Physically, an eigenvector of H with an eigenvalue in
σ(H) \ (σ(H0) + E0) is interpreted as a bound state of H.
Let us consider a typical case of T appearing in quantum scalar ﬁeld
models.
Corollary 8.3. Let H be separable and assume (H.1)–(H.4). Suppose that
T is absolutely continuous and
σ(T ) = σac(T ) = [m, ∞)
(8.107)
with a constant m ≥0. Then:
(i)
σ(Hin/out) = {E0}∪[E0 +m, ∞),
σp(Hin/out) = {E0}.
(8.108)
(ii) {E0} ∪[E0 + m, ∞) ⊂σ(H).
(iii) If m = 0, then σ(H) = [E0, ∞).
(iv) If Fin = Fb(H ) or Fout = Fb(H ), then σ(H) = {E0}∪[E0 +m, ∞)
and the ground state of H is unique.
Proof. (i) By Theorem 5.3 and (8.107), we have
σ(H0) = {0} ∪[m, ∞).
By this fact and Theorem 8.14(i), we obtain (8.108).
Part (ii) follows from (i) and Theorem 8.14(ii).
(iii) Let m = 0. Then, by (ii), [E0, ∞) ⊂σ(H). But it is obvious that
σ(H) ⊂[E0, ∞).
Part (iv) follows from (i) and Theorem 8.14(iii).

Existence of asymptotic creation and annihilation
operators
In concluding this section, we give a suﬃcient condition for (H.2) to hold.
We assume (H.1). Then, we have
H = H0 + H1.
Concerning the perturbation operator H1, we assume the following (H.1)′:
(H.1)′ There exist a number p ≥3/2 and a core D of T −1/2 such that, (i)
for all t ∈R, e−itT D ⊂D; (ii) for all f ∈D, D( *Hp) ⊂D(H1A(f)#) ∩
D(A(f)#)H1) and
∥[H1, A(f)#]Ψ∥≤u#(f)∥( *H + 1)pΨ∥,
Ψ ∈D( *

where u#(f) is a non-negative constant depending on f such that
the mapping : R ∋t →u#(e−itT f) is Borel measurable and

R u#(e−itT f)dt < ∞.
Under assumptions (H.1) and (H.1)′, we have for all Ψ ∈D( *

s ∈R
∥eisH[H1, A(e−isT f)#]e−isHΨ∥≤u#(e−isT f)∥( *H + 1)pΨ∥.

Proof. Let Φ ∈D(H) and Ψ ∈D( *

⟨Φ, At(f)Ψ⟩=
	
e−itHΦ, Ψ(t)

,
where Ψ(t) := A(e−itT f)e−itHΨ. We ﬁrst show that Ψ(t) is strongly diﬀer-
entiable in t (this is non-trivial because of the unboundedness of A(e−itT f)).
For any ε ∈R \ {0}, we have
1
ε(Ψ(t + ε) −Ψ(t)) = A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( *H + 1)−1/2Ψε + A(e−itT fε)e−itHΨ,

Using functional calculus, we have limε→0 Ψε = ( *H + 1)1/2e−itH(−iH)Ψ.
By (8.86), A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( *H + 1)−1/2 is a bounded operator with
∥A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( *H + 1)−1/2∥≤C2∥T −1/2f∥
uniformly in ε. Moreover,
∥A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( *H + 1)−1/2 −A(e−itT f)( *H + 1)−1/2∥

Hence,
lim
ε→0 A(e−i(t+ε)T f)( *H + 1)−1/2Ψε = A(e−itT f)e−itH(−iH)Ψ.
We have limε→0 fε = −iT f. Hence, in the same way as above, we obtain
lim
ε→0 A(e−itT fε)e−itHΨ = A(e−itT (−iT )f)e−itHΨ,
Thus, Ψ(t) is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and

Since e−itHΦ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t with the strong derivative

Proof. Step 1. We ﬁrst extend the result of Lemma 8.13 to the case where
f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( *Hp). Since D is a core of T −1/2, there exists a

sequence {fn}n in D such that fn →f and T −1/2fn →T −1/2f as n →∞.
Let t1, t2 ∈R. Then, by the triangle inequality,

lim sup
t1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥≤2C2∥T −1/2(f −fn)∥∥( *H + 1)1/2Ψ∥.
Then, taking the limit n

At2(f)Ψ∥= 0. Hence, limt→±∞At(f)Ψ exist. Similarly, one cam show the
existence of the strong limits limt→±∞At(f)∗Ψ.
Step 2. We next extend the result in Step 1 to the case where f ∈
D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( *H1/2). Since D( *

there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in D( *Hp) such that Ψn →Ψ and *H1/2Ψn →

t1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −At2(f)Ψ∥≤2C2∥T −1/2f∥∥( *H + 1)1/2(Ψ −Ψn)∥.
Then, taking the limit n
→
∞, we obtain limt1,t2→±∞∥At1(f)Ψ −
At2(f)Ψ∥= 0. Hence, limt→±∞At(f)Ψ exist. Similarly, one can show that
limt→±∞At(f)∗Ψ exist.

A simple model which satisﬁes (H.1) and (H.1)′ will be discussed in
Chapter 13.
Note. The theory presented in this section is an abstraction of exist-
ing theories developed with concrete quantum ﬁeld models (Kato and
Mugibayashi, 1963, 1964, 1971; Høegh-Krohn, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971).

Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we have discussed mainly Wightman’s approach to
axiomatic QFT. As is seen, this approach is operator-theoretical and
“analytic,” so to speak; a quantum ﬁeld is given by an (unbounded)
operator-valued distribution acting in a Hilbert space and the VEVs of
the products of the quantum ﬁeld yield tempered distributions (Wightman
distributions).
Another approach to axiomatic QFT was proposed and developed by
Haag, Kastler and Araki in the 1960s (Haag and Kastler, 1964; Araki, 1964).
In this approach, a central role is played by a C∗-algebra34 of local observ-
ables (observables associated with open subsets in the space-time), which
are represented by bounded operators in contrast to the case of Wightman
quantum ﬁelds. This type of QFT is called algebraic quantum ﬁeld
theory (AQFT). AQFT is beyond the scope of this book, but we shall
use the ideas of AQFT partially in Chapter 15, where a mathematical the-
ory of spontaneous symmetry breaking in QFT is described. For details of
AQFT, see, for example, Araki (1993), Emch (1972, 2009), and Haag (1996)
(a brief introduction to algebraic approach to QFT is presented in Bogoli-
ubov et al., 1975, Appendix A). A pedagogical introduction to AQFT is
found in Fewster and Rejzner (2020).

of a quantum system. The formula in (i) expresses the orthogonal projec-
tion onto the space of ground states of H in terms of the heat semi-group
{e−βH}β>0. Part (ii) is concerned with a formula for the ground state of H

to calculate the lowest energy of H from e−βH independently of whether
or not H has a ground state. Generally, it is important to investigate the
ground states and the lowest energy of a quantum Hamiltonian. The above
formulae may be useful for this purpose.

Remark. A meaning of this problem in the context of quantum mechanics
is as follows. Let G be a group and H be a Hilbert space. A mapping U

from a group G to B(H ) is called a projective representation of G if,
for each g ∈G, U(g) is unitary or anti-unitary and, for all g1, g2 ∈G,
U(g1)U(g2) = ω(g1, g2)U(g1g2)
with ω(g1, g2) ∈C satisfying |ω(g1, g2)| = 1. In quantum mechanics or
QFT, the symmetry deﬁned by G is expressed most generally as a projective
representation of G on a Hilbert space of state vectors. This is a consequence
of Wigner’s theorem (for details, see, for example, Bogoliubov et al., 1975,
Section 2.3). The conclusion of this problem is that, if the Hamiltonian H

Chapter 9
Non-Relativistic QFT
Mathematically rigorous constructions of basic models in non-relativistic QFT
are given.
9.1
Introduction
In this chapter, we begin by showing the existence of models of QFT by
constructing them in a mathematically rigorous way. We ﬁrst discuss the
models in non-relativistic QFT since they are easier to treat than those
in relativistic QFT. A non-relativistic QFT has two further categories:
a bosonic one and a fermionic one (see Section 5.1). We ﬁrst construct a
model of a non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld and then a model of a non-relativistic
Fermi ﬁeld. But, for the reader’s convenience, we begin with a brief descrip-
tion of a corresponding classical ﬁeld theory.
9.2
Classical Field Theory
According to de Broglie (1923), associated with a non-relativistic free parti-
cle (e.g., a non-relativistic electron) in the d-dimensional space Rd = {x =
(x1, . . . , xd)|xj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d} (d ∈N; physically, d = 3) is a matter-
wave u : R × Rd →C; R × Rd ∋(t, x) →u(t, x) ∈C obeying the partial
diﬀerential equation
i∂u(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
Δu(t, x),
(9.1)
609
610
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where mf
> 0 is a constant and Δ is the d-dimensional generalized
Laplacian.1 The function u is called the classical free de Broglie ﬁeld.
We call (9.1) the free de Broglie equation.
One may note that (9.1) is same in form as a Schr¨odinger equation in
quantum mechanics. But the physical meaning of the de Broglie equation
is totally diﬀerent from that of the Schr¨odinger equation as an equation
in quantum mechanics because the former is an equation of motion for a
classical ﬁeld describing a matter-wave, while the latter is an equation for
the probability amplitude of a quantum state.2 For this reason, we do not
use the name “Schr¨odinger equation” for (9.1) in the context of matter-
wave theory.3 Of course, from a purely mathematical point of view, it does
not matter how (9.1) is called.
A classical de Broglie ﬁeld may have a self-interaction (a nonlinear inter-
action) and an interaction with an external ﬁeld (potential) V : R1+d →R.
An equation in which such interactions are incorporated is given by
i∂u(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
Δu(t, x) + V (t, x)u(t, x)
+ U(|u(t, x)|)u(t, x),
(9.2)
where U : [0, ∞) →R is a given function. It is obvious that the case where
V = 0 and U = 0 in (9.2) reduces to (9.1).
The time reversal utr of de Broglie ﬁeld u is deﬁned by
utr(t, x) := u(−t, x)∗.
It is easy to see that
i∂utr(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
Δutr(t, x) + V (−t, x)utr(t, x)
+ U(|utr(t, x)|)utr(t, x).
(9.3)
1For a function f satisfying a classical partial diﬀerential equation, we always assume
the necessary diﬀerentiability for f unless otherwise stated. For example, in the case of
(9.1), it is assumed that u is C1-class in t and C2-class in x.
2This becomes more transparent if one considers an N-body quantum system with
N ≥2, where the probability amplitude of a quantum state is given by an element
in L2((Rd)N) (hence the conﬁguration space is (Rd)N, not Rd as the position space)
or the possibility that a de Broglie ﬁeld may have self-interactions (see the following
paragraph).
3More detailed pedagogical explanations on the conceptual diﬀerences between the
theory of matter-wave and quantum mechanics are found in Tomonaga (1952) with a
full development of the both theories.
Non-Relativistic QFT
611
Hence, if V (t, x) = V (−t, x) (in particular, V is independent of t), then
utr obeys (9.2). This property is called the time-reversal symmetry of
equation (9.2).
In the case where U(r) = λr2, r ∈[0, ∞), with λ ∈R being a constant,
(9.2) takes the following form:
i∂u(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
Δu(t, x) + V (t, x)u(t, x)
+ λ|u(t, x)|2u(t, x).
(9.4)
This equation is called the Gross–Pitaevskii equation.4
As easily seen, for each k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd, the function uk on R1+d
deﬁned by
uk(t, x) := Ake−itω(k)+ik·x
with Ak ∈C, ω(k) := k2/2mf and k · x := d
j=1 kjxj is a solution to (9.1).
Let m > 0 be the mass of the associated non-relativistic free particle
and p = (p1, . . . , pd) ∈Rd be the momentum of the particle with the matter
wave uk. Then, the energy E(p) of the particle is given by
E(p) = p2
2m.
(9.5)
On the other hand, one has the de Broglie–Einstein–Planck relation:
p = ℏk,
E(p) = ℏω(k) = ℏk2
2mf
,
which implies that E(p) = p2/2ℏmf. Comparing this with (9.5), one has
mf = m
ℏ.
(9.6)
This gives a relation between the constant mf in the classical de Broglie
ﬁeld theory and the mass m of the particle, which is expected to be the
quantum of a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld.
9.3
Heuristic Arguments toward Construction of QFT
By substituting (9.6) for (9.2), one obtains an equation which a quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld should obey. Hence, a quantum ﬁeld ψ corresponding to
4Physically, this equation is supposed to describe approximately a classical matter
ﬁeld of a phase in the Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC). For details, see, for example,
Kevrekidis et al. (2008).
612
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
the classical free de Broglie ﬁeld u if it exists should be an operator-valued
distribution on R1+d acting in a suitable Hilbert space F and satisfying
the ﬁeld equation
iℏD0ψ(x) = −ℏ2
2mΔψ(x)
(9.7)
in the sense of operator-valued distribution (x0 = t), i.e.,
ψ(−iℏD0f) = −ℏ2
2mψ(Δf),
f ∈S (R1+d),
(9.8)
on a dense subspace in F.
Remark 9.1. In the case of a classical self-interacting de Broglie ﬁeld
u obeying (9.2), a diﬃculty immediately arises in considering a quantum
ﬁeld ψ as an operator-valued distribution corresponding to it because the
products of ψ(x)#, such as ψ(x)∗ψ(x)ψ(x), are mathematically meaningless
unless ψ(x) is an operator-valued function with a suitable property (but,
in the conventional scheme of ﬁeld quantization, ψ(x) is not an operator-
valued function even in the free ﬁeld case). This applies to other models in
QFT too. In fact, the ill-deﬁnedness of the products of a quantum ﬁeld at
each space-time point is an origin of the so-called “divergence problems” in
QFT and makes it diﬃcult to construct an interacting quantum ﬁeld model
with space-time symmetries.
If one follows the canonical quantization formalism,5 then ψ should be
constructed from a sharp-time quantum ﬁeld ψ(t, ·), and for any ﬁxed time
t ∈R, ψ(t, ·) should satisfy canonical commutation relations (a bosonic
case) or canonical anti-commutations relations (a fermionic case)6:
[ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)∗] = δ(x −y),
[ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)] = 0,
[ψ(t, x)∗, ψ(t, y)∗] = 0
5For a classical ﬁeld φ(t, x) which has a Lagrangian, the momentum conjugate π(t, x)
to φ(t, x) is deﬁned from the Lagrangian density L (φ, ˙φ) ( ˙φ(t, x) := ∂φ(t, x)/∂t)
by π(t, x) := ∂L (φ, ˙φ)/∂˙φ(t, x). The canonical quantization scheme involves replac-
ing φ and π with operator-valued distributions φq and πq, respectively, satisfying
[φq(t, x), πq(t, y)] = iℏδ(x −y) [φq(t, x), φq(t, y)] =, [πq(t, x), πq(t, y)] = 0 (the case
where φq is a Bose ﬁeld) or {φq(t, x), πq(t, y)} = iℏδ(x −y) {φq(t, x), φq(t, y)} = 0,
{πq(t, x), πq(t, y)} = 0 (the case where φq is a Fermi ﬁeld). See, for example, Bjorken
and Drell (1965), Chapter 11.
6In the present case, it is shown that the momentum conjugate to u(t, x) is equal to
iℏu(t, x)∗. See, for example, Arai (2000b), Chapter 8.

or
{ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)∗} = δ(x −y),
{ψ(t, x), ψ(t, y)} = 0,
{ψ(t, x)∗, ψ(t, y)∗} = 0
in the sense of operator-valued distribution, where δ(x −y) is the Dirac
delta distribution on Rd × Rd.
In what follows, we construct such an operator-valued distribution and
investigate its properties. A heuristic idea for the construction is as follows.
The operator
h0 := −ℏ2
2mΔ
(9.9)
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L2(Rd). Hence, {e−ith0/ℏ}t∈R is
a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group, satisfying
iℏd
dt(e−ith0/ℏf) = h0(e−ith0/ℏf),
f ∈D(h0),
where d/dt denotes the strong diﬀerentiation in t. Hence, (9.7) is heuristi-
cally solved as
ψ(t, x) = (e−ith0/ℏψ0)(x)
(x0 = t),
where ψ0 is an operator-valued distribution on Rd. This suggests that the
sharp-time quantum ﬁeld to be constructed is of the form
ψ(t, f) = ψ0(e−ith0/ℏf),
f ∈S (Rd), t ∈R.
(9.10)
Hence, a possible approach is as follows: (i) construct an operator-valued
distribution ψ0 satisfying
[ψ0(x), ψ0(y)∗] = δ(x −y),
(9.11)
[ψ0(x), ψ0(y)] = 0,
[ψ0(x)∗, ψ0(y)∗] = 0
(9.12)
or
{ψ0(x), ψ0(y)∗} = δ(x −y),
(9.13)
{ψ0(x), ψ0(y)} = 0,
{ψ0(x)∗, ψ0(y)∗} = 0
(9.14)
in the sense of operator-valued distribution; (ii) deﬁne ψ(t, f) by (9.10);
(iii) investigate properties of ψ(t, f).

A Bosonic Quantum de Broglie Field
Relations (9.11) and (9.12) suggest that a way to construct a bosonic quan-
tum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical de Broglie ﬁeld may be to take ψ0
as the annihilation operator acting in the boson Fock space
Fb(L2(Rd)) =
∞

n=0
⊗n
s L2(Rd).
over L2(Rd). Hence, let ψ(·) be the annihilation operator on Fb(L2(Rd)),
so that, for all f ∈L2(Rd) and Ψ ∈D(ψ(f))∗), (ψ(f)∗Ψ)(0) = 0,
(ψ(f)∗Ψ)(n) = √nSn(f ⊗Ψ (n−1))
and
[ψ(f), ψ(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩,
(9.15)
[ψ(f), ψ(g)] = 0,
[ψ(f)∗, ψ(g)∗] = 0,
f, g ∈L2(Rd),
(9.16)
on Fb,0(L2(Rd)).
As mentioned in Remark 9.1, it is diﬃcult to construct a self-interacting
quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with full space-time symmetries. Hence, we restrict
ourselves to constructing a free quantum de Broglie ﬁeld and a quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld interacting with an external ﬁeld only. We ﬁrst discuss the
former.
9.4.1
A free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
We denote by Fd the Fourier transform from L2(Rd
x) to L2(Rd
k):
(Fdf)(k) :=
1
(2π)d/2

Rd e−ik·xf(x)dx,
f ∈L2(Rd), a.e. k ∈Rd
k, (9.17)
in the L2-sense. It is well known that Fd is unitary and
FdS (Rd
x) = S (Rd
k).
(9.18)
We introduce the following symbol:
ˆf := Fdf.
Since Fd preserves the inner product of L2(Rd), one has

Rd
ˆf(k)∗g(k)dk =

Rd f(x)∗g(x)dx,
f, g ∈L2(Rd).
(9.19)
This fact is called the Plancherel theorem.
Non-Relativistic QFT

Recall that h0 is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L2(Rd). The
following lemma describes basic properties of h0.
Lemma 9.1.
(i) For all f ∈L2(Rd),
(Fde−ith0/ℏf)(k) = e−itℏk2/2m ˆf(k),
a.e. k ∈Rd.
(ii) For all f ∈L1(Rd) ∩L2(Rd) and t ∈R \ {0},
(e−ith0/ℏf)(x) =


e−dπit/4|t|

Rd eim|x−y|2/2tℏf(y)dy.
(iii) For all t ∈R e−ith0/ℏleaves S (Rd) invariant.
Proof. (i) It is well known that
Fd(−Δ)F −1
d
= k2,
where the right-hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the func-
tion k2. By this fact and the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we
obtain
Fde−ith0/ℏF −1
d
= e−itℏk2/2m,
where the right-hand side denotes the multiplication operator by the func-
tion e−itℏk2/2m. Thus, the desired result follows.
(ii) By (i) and the inverse Fourier transform, we have
(e−ith0/ℏf)(x) =
1
(2π)d/2

Rd eik·xe−itℏk2/2m ˆf(k)dk.
Then, one needs only to calculate the integral on the right-hand side (limit-
ing arguments are needed). But we omit the details (see, for example, Arai,
1997a, Theorem 6.11).
(iii) It is easy to see that the function: k →e−itℏk2/2m ˆf(k) is in S (Rd
k).
By this fact and (9.18), e−ith0/ℏf ∈S (Rd).
□
Recall that ψ(f)Ψ (Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd))) is anti-linear in f ∈L2(Rd). By
Lemma 9.1(i) or (ii),
(e−ith0/ℏf)∗= eith0/ℏf ∗,
t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd).
Taking these facts into account, we deﬁne for an operator ψ(t, f) by
ψ(t, f) := ψ(eith0/ℏf ∗),
f ∈L2(Rd).
616
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 9.2. The mapping S (Rd) ∋f →ψ(t, f) ∈L(Fb(L2(Rd))) is an
operator-valued distribution, with D(N 1/2
b
) being a common domain, where
Nb is the boson number operator on Fb(L2(Rd)).
Proof. It is obvious that, for all f ∈L2(Rd), ψ(t, f) is densely deﬁned and
D(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(ψ(t, f)) ∩D(ψ(t, f)∗). For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), ψ(t, f)Ψ is linear
in f. Moreover,
∥ψ(t, f)Ψ∥≤∥e−ith0/ℏf ∗∥∥N 1/2
b
Ψ∥= ∥f∥∥N 1/2
b
Ψ∥.
Hence, in the same manner as in Example 8.5, one can show that, for all
Φ, Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), the mapping S (Rd) ∋f →⟨Φ, ψ(t, f)Ψ⟩is a tempered
distribution on Rd.
□
Let
HdB := dΓb(h0),
(9.20)
be the boson second quantization of h0 (see Chapter 5).
Theorem 9.1. The quadruple (Fb(L2(Rd)), D(N 1/2
b
), HdB, {ψ(t, ·)}t∈R)
is a sharp-time QFT.7
Proof. We need only to show that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
),
eitHdB/ℏψ(0, f)e−itHdB/ℏΨ = ψ(t, f)Ψ,
f ∈S (Rd), t ∈R.
But this follows from a simple application of Lemma 5.21.
□
Since Nb and HdB are strongly commuting (Proposition 5.5), it follows
that that, for all t ∈R,
eitHdB/ℏN 1/2
b
⊂N 1/2
b
eitHdB/ℏ.
Hence,
eitHdB/ℏD(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(N 1/2
b
).
The Hamiltonian HdB is unique up to constant addition.
Proposition 9.1. Let H be a self-adjoint operator such that, for all Ψ ∈
D(N 1/2
b
) and t ∈R,
eitH/ℏψ(0, f)e−itH/ℏΨ = ψ(t, f)Ψ,
(9.21)
eitH/ℏD(N 1/2
b
) ⊂D(N 1/2
b
).
(9.22)
Then, there exists a constant E such that H = HdB + E.
7See Deﬁnition 8.3.
Non-Relativistic QFT
617
Proof. Properties (9.21) and (9.22) imply that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
) and
t ∈R,
eitH/ℏψ(0, f)∗e−itH/ℏΨ = ψ(t, f)∗Ψ.
Let
A = {ψ(0, f) ↾D(N 1/2
b
), ψ(0, f)∗↾D(N 1/2
b
)|f ∈S (Rd)}.
Then, A = {ψ(f) ↾D(N 1/2
b
), ψ(f)∗↾D(N 1/2
b
)|f ∈S (Rd)}. For any
T ∈A′, T ψ(f)Ψ = ψ(f)T Ψ · · · (∗), for all f ∈S (Rd) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
).
Since D(N 1/2
b
) is a core for ψ(f), it follows from a limiting argument
that (∗) extends to all Ψ ∈D(ψ(f)). The same applies to ψ(f)∗. Hence,
T ∈{ψ(f), ψ(f)∗|f ∈S (Rd)}′ = CI (Theorem 5.15). Therefore, A′ = CI.
Thus, by Proposition 8.2, H = HdB + E for a real constant E.
□
Using commutation relations for ψ(f)#’s (see Theorem 5.14) and the
unitarity of eith0/ℏ, one can show that the following commutation relations
at any ﬁxed time t ∈R hold: for all f, g ∈L2(Rd),
[ψ(t, f), ψ(t, g)∗] = ⟨g, f⟩,
[ψ(t, f), ψ(t, g)] = 0,
[ψ(t, f)∗, ψ(t, g)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(L2(Rd)).
Theorem 9.2 (Field equation). Let f ∈D(Δ) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Then,
the Fb(L2(Rd))-valued function: R ∋t →ψ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable
and
iℏd
dtψ(t, f)Ψ = −ℏ2
2mψ(t, Δf)Ψ.
(9.23)
Proof. We have ψ(t, f)Ψ = ψ(eith0/ℏf ∗)Ψ. Hence, applying Lemma 5.22
with S = I, T = h0 and n = 1, we see that ψ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable
in t and
d
dtψ(t, f)Ψ = −i
ℏψ(e−ith0/ℏh0f ∗)Ψ = iℏ
2mψ(t, Δf)Ψ.
Hence, (9.23) holds.

bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld at time t and the Hamiltonian of
the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld.
9.4.2
Energy–momentum operator
We next show that the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld theory is
space-translation covariant.
For each a ∈Rd, we deﬁne an operator u(a) on L2(Rd) by
(u(a)f)(x) := f(x −a),
f ∈L2(Rd), a.e. x ∈Rd.
(9.24)
Then, by Theorem 1.40, we have
u(a) = e−ia·ˆp/ℏ,
a ∈Rd,
(9.25)
where
ˆp := (ˆp1, . . . , ˆpd),
where ˆpj deﬁned by (1.91) physically denotes the d-dimensional momentum
operator in the sense of non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
Let
Ub(a) := Γb(u(a)),
a ∈Rd.
Then, by Corollary 5.2, {Ub(a)}a∈Rd is a strongly continuous unitary rep-
resentation of Rd.
Since
h0 =
1
2m
d

j=1
(ˆpj)2,
h0 strongly commutes with each ˆpj. Hence, by Theorem 5.32,
Ub(a)ψ(t, f)Ub(a)−1 = ψ(e−ia·ˆp/ℏeith0/ℏf ∗)
= ψ(eith0/ℏe−ia·ˆp/ℏf ∗).
It is easy to see that
e−ia·ˆp/ℏf ∗= (e−ia·ˆp/ℏf)∗= (u(a)f)∗.
Hence,
Ub(a)ψ(t, f)Ub(a)−1 = ψ(t, u(a)f).
Thus, ψ(t, f) is space-translation covariant.
Non-Relativistic QFT
619
On the other hand, a simple application of Theorem 5.8(i) with
T = −a · ˆp yields
Γb(u(a)) = e−ia·P b/ℏ,
where
P b := (P 1
b, . . . , P d
b ),
P j
b := dΓb(ˆpj),
j = 1, . . . , d.
(9.26)
Hence,
Ub(a) = e−ia·P b/ℏ.
Thus, P b is the momentum operator of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie
ﬁeld.
It follows from the strong commutativity of h0 and ˆpj (j = 1, . . . , d) and
Proposition 5.5 that the energy–momentum operator
PdB := (HdB, Pb,1, . . . , Pb,d)
(Pb,j := −P j
b)
of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld is strongly commuting.
Therefore, one can ask what the joint spectrum σJ(PdB) is like. Before
giving an answer to the question, however, we discuss discrete symmetries
of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld.
9.4.3
CT symmetry and parity symmetry
Let uc be the complex conjugation on L2(Rd):
ucf := f ∗,
f ∈L2(Rd).
(9.27)
Then, uc is anti-unitary and
u2
c = I.
It follows from Remark 5.3 that
Uc := Γb(uc)
is an anti-unitary operator on Fb(L2(Rd)) and
U 2
c = I.
Hence,
Uc = U −1
c
.
(9.28)
The time-reversal
quantum
de
Broglie
ﬁeld is deﬁned by
ψ(−t, ucf). The following theorem shows that it is anti-unitarily imple-
mentable by Uc.
620
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 9.3. For all t ∈R and f ∈L2(Rd),
ψ(−t, ucf) = Ucψ(t, f)U −1
c
.
Proof. Theorem 5.32 holds also in the case where Uc is anti-unitary. Hence,
Ucψ(t, f)U −1
c
= ψ(uceith/ℏf ∗) = ψ(e−ith/ℏf) = ψ(−t, f ∗).
□
Theorem 9.4. For all t ∈R and aj ∈R (j = 1, . . . , d),
UceitHdB/ℏU −1
c
= e−itHdB/ℏ,
(9.29)
UceiajPb,j/ℏU −1
c
= eiajPb,j/ℏ,
j = 1, . . . , d.
(9.30)
Proof. We have
UceitHdB/ℏU −1
c
= Γb(uceith0/ℏuc).
It is easy to see that uceith0/ℏuc = e−ith0/ℏ. Hence, (9.29) holds. Similarly,
one can prove (9.30) (use that uce−iaj ˆpj/ℏuc = e−iaj ˆpj/ℏ).
□
We next discuss parity symmetry. The mapping Is : Rd →Rd deﬁned
by
Isx := −x,
x ∈Rd
is called the space-inversion on Rd. This induces a unitary operator us
on L2(Rd):
(usf)(x) := f(Isx) = f(−x),
a.e. x ∈Rd.
(9.31)
Theorem 9.5. For all f ∈L2(Rd) and t ∈R,
Γb(us)ψ(t, f)Γb(us)−1 = ψ(t, usf).
(9.32)
Proof. It is easy to see that
Fd(usf)(k) = ˆf(−k),
a.e. k ∈R3.
Using this formula, we have
useith0/ℏf = eith0/ℏusf.
Thus, (9.32) follows.
□
Theorem 9.5 shows that the space-inversion ψ(t, usf) of the free quan-
tum de Broglie ﬁeld is unitarily implementable by Γb(us).
Non-Relativistic QFT
621
9.4.4
Energy–momentum spectrum
We ﬁrst investigate the spectra of the Hamiltonian HdB and the momentum
operator P b separately.
Let Fd : L2(Rd
x) →L2(Rd
k) be the Fourier transform (see (9.17)).
Then, Γb(Fd) is a unitary operator from Fb(L2(Rd)) = Fb(L2(Rd
x)) onto
Fb(L2(Rd
k)). By Theorem 5.9, for any self-adjoint operator T on L2(Rd
x),
Γb(Fd)dΓb(T )Γb(Fd)−1 = dΓb(FdT F −1
d ).
(9.33)
Recall that
Fdh0F −1
d
= ENR,
FdˆpjF −1
d
= pj
(j = 1, . . . , d),
(9.34)
where ENR and pj are functions on Rd
k deﬁned as follows:
ENR(k) := ℏ2k2
2m ,
pj(k) := ℏkj,
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd
k.
(9.35)
Physically, ENR(k) means the kinetic energy of a non-relativistic free par-
ticle of mass m with momentum ℏk. It follows from the spectral property
of a multiplication operator that
σ(h0) = σ(ENR) = [0, ∞),
σp(h0) = σp(ENR) = ∅,
(9.36)
σ(ˆpj) = σ(pj) = R,
σp(ˆpj) = σp(pj) = ∅,
(9.37)
where pj := −pj (j = 1, . . . , d).
By (9.33) and (9.34), we obtain the following operator equations:
Γb(Fd)HdBΓb(Fd)−1 = ˆHdB,
Γb(Fd)Pb,jΓb(Fd)−1 = ˆPb,j
(j = 1, . . . , d),
where
ˆHdB := dΓb(ENR),
(9.38)
ˆPb,j := dΓb(pj).
(9.39)
It follows from the unitary invariance of the spectra of a linear operator
that
σ( ˆHdB) = σ(HdB),
σp( ˆHdB) = σp(HdB),
(9.40)
σ( ˆPb,j) = σ(Pb,j),
σp( ˆPb,j) = σp(Pb,j).
(9.41)
622
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 9.6.
(i)
σ(HdB) = [0, ∞),
σp(HdB) = {0},
where the Fock vacuum ΩL2(Rd) ∈Fb(L2(Rd
x)) is the unique ground
state of HdB:
HdBΩL2(Rdx) = 0.
(ii) For all j = 1, . . . , d,
σ(Pb,j) = R,
σp(Pb,j) = {0},
where
ker Pb,j = {αΩL2(Rdx)|α ∈C}.
Proof. (i) By (9.38), Theorem 5.3 and (9.36), we have
σ( ˆHdB) = [0, ∞),
σp( ˆHdB) = {0}
with ker ˆHdB = {αΩL2(Rd
k)|α ∈C}. By these facts and (9.40), we obtain
the desired result.
(ii) Similar to the proof of (i).
□
We next investigate the joint spectrum σJ(PdB) of the energy–
momentum operator PdB (see Section 1.8.2). The result is as follows.
Theorem 9.7.
σJ(PdB) = [0, ∞) × Rd.
(9.42)
To prove this theorem, we need some preliminaries.
Lemma 9.3. Let N ≥2 (N ∈N) and T := (T1, . . . , TN) be an N-tuple of
strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H . We denote
by ET the joint spectral measure of T . Let U be a unitary operator from H
to a Hilbert space K . Then, T U := (UT1U −1, . . . , UTNU −1) is an N-tuple
of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on K and
UET (B)U −1 = ET U (B),
B ∈BN.
(9.43)
In particular,
σJ(T ) = σJ(T U).
(9.44)
Non-Relativistic QFT
623
Proof. For a self-adjoint operator S on a Hilbert space, we denote by ES
the spectral measure of S. For all K ∈B1
UETj(K)U −1 = EUTjU−1(K),
j = 1, . . . , N.
Hence, it follows that T U is strongly commuting and
UET (K1×· · ·×KN)U −1 = ET U (K1×· · ·×KN),
Kj ∈B1, j = 1, . . . , N.
For each Ψ ∈K , there are two bounded measures μ1 and μ2 on (RN, BN)
deﬁned by
μ1(B) :=

Ψ, UET (B)U −1Ψ
	
,
μ2(B) := ⟨Ψ, ET U (B)Ψ⟩,
B ∈BN.
The above equation means that
μ1(K1 × · · · × KN) = μ2(K1 × · · · × KN),
Kj ∈B1.
Hence, by the uniqueness of Hopf’s extension theorem, μ1 = μ2. By this
result and the polarization identity, we obtain (9.43).
Equation (9.43) implies that
supp UET (·)U −1 = supp ET U = σJ(T U).
On the other hand, it is easy to see that
supp UET (·)U −1 = supp ET = σJ(T ).
Thus, (9.44) holds.
□
Let EdB be the joint spectral measure of PdB and
ˆEdB(B) := Γ(Fd)EdB(B)Γ(Fd)−1,
B ∈B1+d.
Then, by Lemma 9.3, ˆEB is the joint spectral measure of
ˆPdB := ( ˆHdB, ˆPb,1, . . . , ˆPb,d),
and
σJ(PdB) = σJ( ˆPdB).
(9.45)
Hence, we investigate σJ( ˆPdB).
We have
ˆHdB = ⊕∞
n=0Hn,
where ˆH0 := 0 and ˆHn with n ≥1 is the multiplication operator on

ENR(kl),
kl ∈Rd
k, l = 1, . . . , n.
Since Hn is a multiplication operator, the spectral measure EHn of Hn
takes the form
EHn(J) = χE−1
n (J),
J ∈B1,
where the right-hand side is the multiplication operator by the characteris-
tic function χE−1
n (J) of the set E−1
n (J) := {k ∈Rd
k|En(k) ∈J}. Hence, by

Let

Lemma 9.5. The set Pn is closed.

Since supN≥1 |pN| < ∞, it follows that, for all l = 1, . . . , n, supN≥1 |k(N)

It remains to make explicit the set on the right-hand side of (9.49). It

If pl = p/n, l = 1, . . . , n −1, then the equality holds in (9.50).

p0 = ENR(k1, . . . , kn),

Conversely, let (p0, p) ∈Qn. Then, p0 ≥p2/2mn. The function f on

(pl ∈Rd, l = 1, . . . , n −1)

element (p1, . . . , pn−1) ∈(Rd)n−1 such that p0 = f(p1, . . . , pn−1). Hence,
letting kl = pl/ℏ, l = 1, . . . , n −1 and kn = (p −n−1
l=1 )pl/ℏ, we see that
p0 = ENR(k1, . . . , kn). Hence, (p0, p) ∈Pn. Thus, Qn ⊂Pn.
□
Now, we are ready to prove Theorem 9.7. It follows from Lemma 9.8
that

By this fact and Lemma 9.7, we obtain (9.42).

Galilean symmetry
In this section, we discuss the symmetry properties of the free bosonic quan-
tum de Broglie ﬁeld. For this purpose, we ﬁrst introduce a transformation
group which acts on a non-relativistic space-time.
We denote by Md(R) the set of d × d real matrices. The set
O(d) := {R ∈Md(R)|tRR = I}
(9.51)
of d × d orthogonal matrices forms a group with the product operation
of matrices, called the d-dimensional orthogonal group. We introduce the
direct product of O(d), Rd and R1+d:
G1+d := O(d) × Rd × R1+d
= {(R, v, a)|R ∈O(d), v ∈Rd, a ∈R1+d}.
Each (R, v, a) ∈G1+d deﬁnes a mapping on R1+d by
(R, v, a)(x) := (t + a0, Rx + vt + a),
x = (t, x) ∈R1+d,
where a = (a0, a) ∈R × Rd. The mapping (R, v, a) is called a Galilei
transformation on R1+d. Note that the motion R ∋t →Rx + vt is a
uniform motion with velocity v and the initial position being Rx.
It is obvious that
(Id, 0, 0) = I
(identity),
where Id is the d×d unit matrix. It is easy to see that each (R, v, a) ∈G1+d
is a bijection with
(R, v, a)−1 = (R−1, −R−1v, (−a0, −R−1(a −a0v))) ∈G1+d.
(9.52)
Moreover, for all (R, v, a), (T, u, b) ∈G1+d,
(T, u, b)(R, v, a) = (T R, T v + u, (b0 + a0, T a + b + a0u)) ∈G1+d.
Hence, G1+d is a transformation group on R1+d. The transformation group
G1+d is called the (1 + d)-dimensional Galilei group. For g ∈G1+d and
x ∈R1+d, we sometimes write g(x) = gx.
The subset
G hom
1+d := {(R, v, 0)|R ∈O(d), v ∈Rd}
of G1+d forms a subgroup of G1+d. The subgroup G hom
1+d is called the (1 + d)-
dimensional homogeneous Galilei group.
Non-Relativistic QFT
629
A function u : R1+d →C is said to be Galilei invariant (resp.,
homogeneously Galilei invariant) if, for all g ∈G1+d (resp., G hom
1+d ),
u(gx) = u(x), x = (t, x) ∈R1+d.
For each u : R1+d →C, g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d and a constant C ∈R, one
can deﬁne u(g,C) : R1+d →C by
u(g,C)(t, x) := e−iCθ(t,x,v)u(g(t, x)),
(t, x) ∈R1+d,
where
θ(t, x, v) := v · Rx + 1
2v2t.
The function u(g,C) is called the Galilei transformation of u associated
with (g, C).
We denote by SV,dB the space of solutions to the nonlinear de Broglie
equation (9.2):
SV,dB := {u : R1+d →C|u satisﬁes (9.2)}.
The following theorem tells us how the space SV,dB is transformed under
Galilei transformations.
Theorem 9.8. Let u ∈SV,dB and
ug := u(g,mf).
(9.53)
Then, ug satisﬁes the following partial diﬀerential equation:
i∂ug(t, x)
∂t
= −1
2mf
Δug(t, x) + V (g(t, x))ug(t, x)
+ U(|ug(t, x)|)ug(t, x),
(9.54)
Proof. We set x = (t, x), ∂t := ∂/∂t and
∇:=
 ∂
∂x1 , . . . ,
∂
∂xd

.
Let g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d. Then,
ug(x) = e−imfθ(x,v)u(gx).
Hence, by direct computations, we have the following results:
∂tug(x) = −i
2mfv2ug(x)
+ e−imfθ(x,v)[(∂tu)(gx) + v · (∇u)(gx)],
∇ug(x) = −imf
tRvug(x) + e−imfθ(x,v) tR(∇u)(gx),
630
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Δug(x) = −m2
f v2ug(x) −2imfe−imfθ(x,v)v · (∇u)(gx)
+ e−imfθ(x,v)(Δu)(gx),
where we have used the fact tR = R−1 ∈O(d). Hence,
i∂tug(x) +
1
2mf
Δug(x) = e−imfθ(x,v)

i(∂tu)(gx) +
1
2mf
(Δu)(gx)

.
Using (9.2) and |ug(x)| = |u(gx)|, one sees that the right-hand side is equal
to V (gx)ug(x) + U(|ug(x)|)ug(x). Hence, (9.54) holds.
□
Remark 9.2. Note that, if the term e−imfθ(x,v) is absent in the deﬁnition
of ug, then (9.54) does not hold.
Corollary 9.1. Assume that V is Galilei invariant. Then, for all u ∈
SV,dB and g ∈G1+d, ug ∈SV,dB.
This corollary shows that, for all g ∈G1+d, the solution space SV,dB,
with V being Galilei invariant, is invariant under the Galilei transformation
of a classical ﬁeld u: u →ug. We call this property the Galilean symmetry
of the nonlinear de Broglie equation (9.2). In particular, this symmetry
holds in the case of V = 0.
We next consider Galilean symmetry of the free bosonic quantum de
Broglie ﬁeld. To ﬁnd the form of a Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld, we recall that, for any φ ∈D(h0), the function
φ(t) := e−ith0/ℏφ
(t ∈R)
satisﬁes the strong diﬀerential equation
iℏdφ(t)
dt
= h0φ(t)
in L2(Rd), where dφ(t)/dt is the strong derivative of φ(t) with respect to t.
Deﬁne ˜φ : R1+d →C by
˜φ(t, x) := φ(t)(x) = (e−ith0/ℏφ)(x),
a.e. x ∈Rd.
Then, for each g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d,
˜φg(t, x) = ˜φ(g,mf)(t, x) = e−imfθ(t,x,v)(e−i(t+a0)h0/ℏφ)(Rx + vt + a)
= e−imθ(t,x,v)/ℏ
ei(a+vt)·ˆp/ℏe−i(t+a0)h0/ℏφ

(Rx),
where (9.6) is used. By Corollary 9.1, ˜φg satisﬁes the free de Broglie equation
under suitable conditions for φ.
Non-Relativistic QFT
631
Now, let ψ(f) (f ∈L2(Rd)) be the annihilation operator on Fb(L2(Rd))
as before. By replacing φ(x) in the above equation with the operator-valued
distribution kernel ψ(x) of ψ(f ∗) and formally smearing the resulting equa-
tion by a function f ∈L2(Rd), we arrive at the following deﬁnition for the
Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with
g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d:
ψg(t, f) := ψ(Kv,a(t)f ∗
R),
(9.55)
where
Kv,a(t) := ei(t+a0)h0/ℏe−i(a+vt)·ˆp/ℏeimθt,v/ℏ,
with θt,v being the multiplication operator by the function
θt,v(x) := v · x + 1
2v2t,
x ∈Rd
and
fR(x) := f(R−1x),
x ∈Rd.
To rewrite Kv,a(t), we note that
Kv,a(t) = eimθt,v/ℏ
e−imθt,v/ℏei(t+a0)h0/ℏeimθt,v/ℏ
×

e−imθt,v/ℏe−i(a+vt)·ˆp/ℏeimθt,v/ℏ
.
It is easy to see that
e−imθt,v/ℏˆpjeimθt,v = ˆpj + mvj,
j = 1, . . . , d.
Hence, by the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we obtain
Kv,a(t) = eimθt,v/ℏei(t+a0)h0(v)/ℏe−i(a+vt)·(ˆp+mv)/ℏ,
(9.56)
with
h0(v) :=
1
2m(ˆp + mv)2.
Lemma 9.9. Let f ∈D(h0). Then, Kv,a(t)f is strongly diﬀerentiable in
t ∈R and
dKv,a(t)f
dt
= i
ℏKv,a(t)h0f.
632
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. It follows from the strong commutativity of ˆp that h0 strongly
commutes with (a + vt) · (ˆp + mv) and D(h0) ⊂D((a + vt) · (ˆp + mv)).
Hence, using (9.56), we see that Kv,a(t)f is strongly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R
and
dKv,a(t)f
dt
= i
ℏKv,a(t)

m
2 v2 + h0(v) −v · (ˆp + mv

f
= i
ℏKv,a(t)h0f.
Thus, we obtain the desired result.
□
We are now ready to derive an equation of motion for ψg(t, f).
Theorem 9.9. Let g ∈G1+d, f ∈D(Δ) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
). Then, ψg(t, f)Ψ
is strongly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R and
iℏd
dtψg(t, f)Ψ = −ℏ2
2mψg(t, Δf)Ψ.
(9.57)
Proof. It is easy to see that f ∗
R ∈D(h0). Hence, it follows from Lemma 9.9
that ψg(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
d
dtψg(t, f)Ψ = ψ
dKv,a(t)f ∗
R
dt

= −i
ℏψ(Kv,a(t)h0f ∗
R).
It is easy to see that Δf ∗
R = (Δf)∗
R. Hence, (9.57) holds.
□
Thus, we see that the Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum de
Broglie ﬁeld ψg(t, f) obeys the free bosonic quantum de Broglie equation.
For each R ∈O(d), we deﬁne η(R) : L2(Rd) →L2(Rd) by
(η(R)f) := fR,
f ∈L2(Rd).
It is easy to see that η(R) is a unitary representation of O(d) on L2(Rd)
(cf. Problem 3). Hence, for each g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d, the operator
ρt(g) := Kv,a(t)η(R)
is a unitary operator on L2(Rd). By (9.55), we have
ψg(t, f) = ψ(ρt(g)f ∗).
Therefore, letting
Ut(g) := Γb(ρt(g))
Non-Relativistic QFT
633
and applying Theorem 5.32, we obtain
Ut(g)ψ(f ∗)Ut(g)−1 = ψg(t, f).
(9.58)
This gives a unitarily covariant relation between the time-zero ﬁeld ψ(f ∗)
and the Galilei transformed free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld ψg(t, f)
at time t. It follows from (9.58) that
ψg(t, f) = Vt(g)ψ(t, f)Vt(g)−1,
t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd),
(9.59)
where
Vt(g) := Ut(g)e−itHdB/ℏ.
Since Vt(g) is unitary, (9.59) means that ψg(t, f) is unitarily equivalent to
ψ(t, f).
In concluding this section, we derive a relation between ψg(0, f) and
ψg(t, f).
For each v ∈Rd, we deﬁne
hv := h0 −v · ˆp + m
2 v2
acting in L2(Rd).
Lemma 9.10. For all v ∈Rd, hv is a non-negative self-adjoint operator.
Proof. It is well known and easy to see that each ˆpj is inﬁnitesimally
small with respect to h0. Hence, by Corollary 1.1(i), hv is self-adjoint and
bounded from below. It is to see that
hv =
1
2m(ˆp −mv)2.
Hence, hv is non-negative.
□
Theorem 9.10. Let g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d and f ∈L2(Rd). Then,
ψg(t, f) = eitdΓb(hv)/ℏψg(0, f)e−itdΓb(hv)/ℏ,
t ∈R,
(9.60)
where dΓb(hv) is the boson second quantization of hv.
Proof. By (9.58), we have
ψg(0, f) = U0(g)ψ(f ∗)U0(g)−1.
634
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence,
ψg(t, f) = Ut(g)U0(g)−1ψg(0, f)U0(g)Ut(g)−1
= Γb(αt(g))ψg(0, f)Γb(αt(g))−1,
where αt(g) := ρt(g)ρ0(g)−1. By direct computations, one sees that αt(g) =
eithv/ℏ. Thus, (9.60) follows.
□
9.4.6
Interaction with an external ﬁeld
In this section, we consider a bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld interacting
with an external ﬁeld. An external scalar ﬁeld is a real-valued Borel mea-
surable function V on Rd such that V (x) is ﬁnite for a.e. x ∈Rd. Then,
the one-boson Hamiltonian is given by the Schr¨odinger operator
hV := −ℏ2
2mΔ + V
acting in L2(Rd). We assume that hV is essentially self-adjoint.8 Then, the
self-adjoint operator hV (the closure of hV ) generates the strongly contin-
uous one-parameter unitary group {eithV /ℏ}t∈R. So as a natural extension
of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld, we deﬁne an operator ψV (t, f)
(t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd)) by
ψV (t, f) := ψ(eithV /ℏf ∗)
In the same way as in Lemma 9.2, one can prove the following lemma.
Lemma 9.11. For each t ∈R, the mapping S (Rd) ∋f →ψV (t, f) ∈
L(Fb(L2(Rd)) is an operator-valued distribution, with D(N 1/2
b
) being a
common domain.
The boson second quantization operator
HdB(V ) := dΓb(hV )
(9.61)
of hV is self-adjoint. In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 9.1, one
can show that, for all t ∈R and f ∈L2(Rd),
eitHdB(V )/ℏψV (0, f)e−itHdB(V )/ℏ= ψV (t, f)
8For classes of V satisfying this assumption, see, for example, Reed and Simon (1975),
Chapter X.
Non-Relativistic QFT
635
on D(N 1/2
b
). Thus, (Fb(L2(Rd)), D(N 1/2
b
), HdB(V ), {ψV (t, ·)}t∈R) is a
sharp-time QFT.
It follows from the general properties of a boson second quantization
operator that 0 is an eigenvalue of HdB(V ) with the Fock vacuum ΩL2(Rd)
being its eigenvector:
HdB(V )ΩL2(Rd) = 0.
(9.62)
But we note that ΩL2(Rd) is not necessarily a ground state of HdB(V )
because HdB(V ) is not necessarily non-negative.
Proposition 9.2.
(i) If hV ≥0, then HdB(V ) ≥0 and the Fock vacuum ΩL2(Rd) is a ground
state of HdB(V ), with the ground state energy being zero.
(ii) If σ(hV ) ∩(−∞, 0) ̸= ∅, then HdB(V ) is not bounded from below.
Proof. The non-negativity of HdB(V ) in (i) and the unboundedness from
below of HdB(V ) in (ii) follow from an application of Theorem 5.2. The
statement on the ground state of HdB(V ) in (i) follows from (9.62).
□
The ﬁeld equation of ψV (t, f) is formulated in the following theorem.
Theorem 9.11. For all f ∈D(hV ) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), ψV (t, f)Ψ is strongly
diﬀerentiable in t and
iℏd
dtψV (t, f)Ψ = −ℏ2
2mψV (t, Δf)Ψ + ψV (t, V f)Ψ.
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 9.2.
□
Remark 9.3. Consider the case where V is continuous except at a ﬁnite
number of points in Rd and not a constant function. Then, ˆpj does not
strongly commute with V .9 Hence, hV and ˆpj do not strongly commute.
Physically, this means that, in the one-boson system under consideration,
the momentum ˆpj (j = 1, 2, . . . , d) is not a conserved quantity. An appli-
cation of Proposition 5.5 yields that each Pb,j does not strongly com-
mute with HdB(V ). Hence, in this quantum system, the joint spectrum
of (HdB(V ), Pb,1, . . . , Pb,d) makes no sense.

The Operator-Valued Distribution Kernel of the Boson
Annihilation Operator
In this section, we show that the operator-valued distribution kernel of
the boson annihilation operator ψ(f ∗) (f ∈S (Rd)) on Fb(L2(Rd)) has
meaning as an operator-valued function, and we discuss related topics.
We denote by C((Rd)n) the set of continuous functions on (Rd)n and
introduce a subspace:
DC := {Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd))|Ψ (n) ∈C((Rd)n), n ≥1},
which is dense in Fb(L2(Rd)). For each x ∈Rd, we deﬁne a linear operator
ψ(x) on Fb(L2(Rd)) as follows:
D(ψ(x)) := DC,
(9.63)
(ψ(x)Ψ)(n)(x1, . . . , xn) :=
√
n + 1Ψ (n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn),
Ψ ∈D(ψ(x)),
n ≥0,
(9.64)
We call ψ(x) the boson annihilation operator at the point x.
We remark that the domain of ψ(x) is independent of x and, in the
deﬁnition of D(ψ(x)), the condition of continuity of each component Ψ (n)
of Ψ ∈D(ψ(x)) is necessary because the right-hand side of (9.64) has to be
uniquely determined as an equivalence class for each x.10
It is easy to see that ψ(x) is densely deﬁned and leaves DC invariant.
But, as the following proposition shows, the operator ψ(x) is somewhat
singular.
Proposition 9.3. For all x ∈Rd, D(ψ(x)∗) = {0}. In particular, ψ(x) is
not closable.
Proof. Let Φ ∈D(ψ(x)∗) and Θ := ψ(x)∗Φ. Then, for all Ψ ∈D(ψ(x)),
⟨Φ, ψ(x)Ψ⟩= ⟨Θ, Ψ⟩. Let Ψ be of the following form: Ψ (k) = 0, k ̸= n + 1
(n ≥0). Then,
(Φ(0))∗Ψ (1)(x) =

Let u ∈C∞
0 (Rd) be such that
supp u ⊂{x′ ∈Rd| |x′| ≤1}, u ≥0, u(0) = 1,

Rd u(x′)dx′ = 1
and deﬁne a function gs : Rd →R (s > 0) by
gs(x′) := sd/2u(s(x′ −x))1/2,
x′ ∈Rd.
Then, gs ∈L2(Rd) and ∥gs∥= 1. Moreover, for any f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), by the
change of variable y = s(x′ −x),
⟨f, gs⟩= s−d/2


Hence, letting M := supx′∈Rd |f(x′)|, we have
| ⟨f, gs⟩| ≤s−d/2M

Rd u(y)1/2dy →0
(s →∞).
Therefore, lims→∞⟨f, gs⟩= 0. Since C∞
0 (Rd) is dense in L2(Rd), it follows
from Proposition A.1 in Appendix A that w- lims→∞gs = 0. Using this fact
and Proposition A.1 again, we can prove that, for any Ξ ∈⊗n
s L2(Rd) and
hj ∈L2(Rd) (j = 1, . . . , n −1),
lim
s→∞⟨Ξ, Sn(gs ⊗h1 ⊗· · · ⊗hn−1)⟩= 0.
(9.67)
Taking gs as Ψ (1) in (9.65), we have lims→∞(Φ(0))∗gs(x) = 0. But
gs(x) = sd/2. Hence, Φ(0) = 0.
We next show that Φ(n) = 0 for all n ≥1. Taking Sn+1(f1 ⊗· · · ⊗fn+1)
with fj ∈S (Rd) (j = 1, . . . , n + 1) as Ψ (n+1) in (9.66), we have

to inﬁnity as s →∞. But the right-hand side of (9.68) is indepen-
dent of s, being equal to ∥Θ(n+1)∥∥f2∥· · · ∥fn+1∥. This is a contradiction.
Hence,

Φ(n), Sn(f2 ⊗· · · ⊗fn+1)
	
= 0. Since Sn(⊗
nL2(Rd)) is dense in
⊗n
s L2(Rd), it follows that Φ(n) = 0. Hence, Φ = 0. Thus, D(ψ(x)∗) = {0}.
In particular, D(ψ(x)∗) is not dense in Fb(L2(Rd)). Hence, ψ(x) is not
closable.

Remark 9.4. It is easy to see that the formal manipulation on ψ(x)∗

tically the reason why D(ψ(x)∗) = {0} and suggests that ψ(x)∗may be
reinterpreted as an operator from DC to the dual space D′
C in a suitable
topology. Indeed, this idea has been extensively developed in white noise
analysis (Obata, 1994).
Proposition 9.4. For all Ψ ∈DC, ∥ψ(·)Ψ∥2 is integrable with respect to

Formula (9.70) can be extended to a more general class of second quan-
tization operators. Let h be a Borel measurable function on Rd such that,
for a.e. x ∈Rd, |h(x)| is ﬁnite. Then, the multiplication operator by h on
L2(Rd) is densely deﬁned and closed. Hence, the boson second quantization
operator dΓb(h) of h is deﬁned. We introduce a subspace of DC:
DC,h :=

Ψ ∈DC|

(Rd)n |h(x1)|2|Ψ (n)(x1, . . . , xn)|2
× dx1 · · · dxn < ∞, n ≥1

Let Ψ ∈DC,h and j = 1, . . . , n (n ∈N). Then, by the permutation
symmetry of Ψ (n), we have

(Rd)n |h(xj)|2Ψ (n)(x1, . . . , xn)|2dx1 · · · dxn


(Rd)n |h(x1)|2Ψ (n)(x1, . . . , xn)|2dx1 · · · dxn < ∞.

Sesquilinear Forms Deﬁned by ψ(x) and ψ(x)∗
Formula (9.72) suggests that ψ(x) may be used to deﬁne sesquilinear
forms (see Section 2.1) which, in special cases, deﬁne linear operators on
Fb(L2(Rd)). In this section, we brieﬂy discuss this aspect.
We introduce a subspace of DC:
DS := {Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd))|Ψ (n) ∈S (Rdn), n ≥1}
It is easy to see that DS is dense in Fb(L2(Rd)). We ﬁrst note the following
fact.
642

Lemma
9.12. For
each
x
∈
Rd,
ψ(x)
leaves
DS
invariant:
ψ(x)DS ⊂DS .
Proof. Let Ψ ∈DS . Then, we have (9.64). It is easy to see that, for each
x ∈Rd, the function Ψ (n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn) of (x1, . . . , xn) is an element in
S (Rdn). Hence, (ψ(x)Ψ)(n) ∈S (Rdn). Thus, ψ(x)Ψ ∈DS .
□
Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS and m, n ∈Z+ with m + n ≥1. Then, by Lemma 9.12,
one can deﬁne a function KΨ,Φ on Rdm × Rdn by
KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) := ⟨ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ, ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ⟩,
(9.73)
for all (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) ∈Rdm × Rdn.
Lemma 9.13. For all Ψ, Φ ∈DS , KΨ,Φ ∈S (Rdm × Rdn).
Proof. Let p ≥0. Then, by repeated use of (9.64), we have
(ψ(x1) . . . ψ(xm)Ψ)(p)(x′

p)
=

(p + 1) . . . (p + m)Ψ (p+m)(xm, . . . , x1, x′

Since the summation with respect to p is over a ﬁnite number of terms, it
is suﬃcient to show that each term on the right-hand side is an element
in S (Rdm × Rdn) as a function of (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn). Here, we only
give an idea to do it by showing that, for all f ∈S (R2), the function g
deﬁned by
g(x) :=

R
f(x, y)dy,
x ∈R
is an element in S (R).
Non-Relativistic QFT
643
Since the partial derivative ∂xf of f in x is in S (R2), it follows that,
for all N ≥1, there exists a constant aN > 0 such that
|∂xf(x, y)| ≤
aN
(1 + x2 + y2)N ≤
aN
(1 + y2)N .
The function: R ∋y →aN(1 + y2)−N is an integrable function on
R independent of x. Hence, by a general theorem concerning the inter-
changeability between diﬀerentiation and integral, g is diﬀerentiable with
dg(x)/dx =
 
R ∂xf(x, y)dy. One can continue this process of argument suc-
cessively to conclude that g is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable with
g(n)(x) := dng(x)
dxn
=

R
∂n
xf(x, y)dy, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
Hence, for all m ∈N,
|x|m|g(n)(x)| ≤

R
|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)|dy.
Since xm∂n
xf is an element in S (R2), lim|x|→∞|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)| = 0. For
any N ≥1, there exists a constant bN > 0 such that
|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)| ≤
bN
(1 + x2 + y2)N ≤
bN
(1 + y2)N .
Hence, according to the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,

R
|x|m|∂n
xf(x, y)|dy →0 (|x| →∞).
Therefore, |x|m|g(n)(x)|
→
0 (|x|

S (R). This
method
can
be

Let F be a tempered distribution on Rd(m+n), i.e., F ∈S ′(Rd(m+n)).
Then, by Lemma 9.13, one can deﬁne a mapping LF : DS × DS →C by
LF (Ψ, Φ) := F(KΨ,Φ),
(Ψ, Φ) ∈DS × DS .
As is easily seen, LF is a sesquilinear form on DS .
644
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Note that, if F is a polynomially bounded function (see Section D.3.2)
or an element of Lp(Rd(m+n)) (p ≥1),
LF (Ψ, Φ) =

Rd(m+n) dx1 · · · dxmdy1 · · · dynF(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
× ⟨ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ, ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ⟩.
(9.75)
From this point of view, the sesquilinear form LF is sometimes written
symbolically as
LF =

Rd(m+n) F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)ψ(xm)∗. . . ψ(x1)∗
× ψ(y1) . . . ψ(yn)dx1 . . . dxmdy1 . . . dyn
or
LF =

Rd(m+n) ψ(xm)∗. . . ψ(x1)∗F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
× ψ(y1) . . . ψ(yn)dx1 . . . dxmdy1 . . . dyn,
where F(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) is the distribution kernel of F. But the
reader should keep in mind that these are just convenient symbolic expres-
sions for LF and have no mathematical meaning as integrals at this stage.
Remark 9.5. Since ψ(x)ψ(y) = ψ(y)ψ(x) on DS for all x, y ∈Rd,
the object ψ(xm)∗. . . ψ(x1)∗(resp., ψ(y1) . . . ψ(yn)) in the above expres-
sions can be replaced by ψ(xσ(1))∗. . . ψ(xσ(m))∗with any σ ∈Sm (resp.,
ψ(yσ(1)) . . . ψ(yσ(n)) with any σ ∈Sn).
We here recall a concept concerning sesquilinear forms on a Hilbert
space. Let H be a Hilbert space and D be a subspace of H . A sesquilinear
form q : D × D →C on D is said to be equal to a linear operator T on
D if D ⊂D(T ) and ⟨ψ, T φ⟩= q(ψ, φ), ψ, φ ∈D. In this case, we write
T = q on D.
In this case, q is said to have an operator representation T .
Proposition 9.7. Let h be a polynomially bounded function on Rd (see
Section D.3.2). Then,
dΓb(h) =

Rd h(x)ψ(x)∗ψ(x)dx
on DS .
(9.76)
Non-Relativistic QFT
645
In particular,
Nb =

Rd ψ(x)∗ψ(x)dx
on DS.
Proof. Since h is polynomially bounded, it follows that DS ⊂DC,h. Then,
(9.72) implies (9.76).
□
Remark 9.6. Proposition 9.7 gives a mathematically rigorous meaning to
the informal symbol “
 
Rd h(x)ψ(x)∗ψ(x)dx” used in the physics literature
on QFT.
In applications, the case where LF is a symmetric form is particularly
important. Hence, let us see when LF becomes a symmetric form. We ﬁrst
note the following fact.
Lemma 9.14. Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS such that Ψ (r) = 0 for all r ̸= m and Φ(r) = 0
for all r ̸= n. Then, for all (x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) ∈Rd(m+n),
KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)
=
√
m!n!Ψ (m)(x1, . . . , xm)∗Φ(n)(y1, . . . , yn).
(9.77)
Proof. By (9.74), we see that, for all p ≥1,
(ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(p) = 0, (ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ)(p) = 0
and
(ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(0) =
√
m!Ψ (m)(xm, . . . , x1),
(ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Φ)(0) =
√
n!Φ(n)(yn, . . . , y1).
Since Ψ (m) and Φ(n) are permutation symmetric, (9.77) follows.
□
Proposition 9.8. Let F ∈S ′(Rd(m+n)) and F ̸= 0. Then, LF is symmet-
ric if and only if m = n and
F(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn)∗= F(y1, . . . , yn, x1, . . . , xn)
(9.78)
in the sense of distribution.
Proof. Suppose that LF
is symmetric. Then, for all Ψ, Φ
∈
DS ,
LF (Ψ, Φ)∗= LF (Φ, Ψ), which implies that F(KΨ,Φ)∗= F(KΦ,Ψ) · · · (∗).
Let Ψ be such that Ψ (r) = 0 for all r ≥m + 1 and n > m. Then, by (9.74),
ψ(y1) · · · ψ(yn)Ψ = 0. Hence, KΦ,Ψ = 0. Therefore, by (∗), F(KΨ,Φ) = 0.
646
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By (9.74) again, we have (ψ(x1) · · · ψ(xm)Ψ)(ℓ) = 0 for all ℓ≥1. Hence,
by using Lemma 9.14, we obtain F((Ψ (m))∗× Φ(n)) = 0. This implies that
F = 0. But this contradicts the assumption F ̸= 0. Hence, n ≤m. Sim-
ilarly, one can show that n ≥m. Thus, n = m. In this case, (∗) implies
(9.78) in the sense of distribution.
Conversely, suppose that (9.78) holds. By the deﬁnition of the
complex conjugate of a tempered distribution, for all Ψ, Φ
∈
DS ,
LF (Ψ, Φ)∗= F(KΨ,Φ)∗= F ∗(K∗
Ψ,Φ). By (9.78) and (9.73), we have
F ∗(K∗
Ψ,Φ) = F(KΦ,Ψ) = LF (Φ, Ψ). Hence, LF (Ψ, Φ)∗= LF (Φ, Ψ). Thus,
LF is symmetric.
□
It is natural to ask when LF has an operator representation. To answer
the question, we ﬁrst note the following fact.
Lemma 9.15. Let Ψ ∈DS and m ≥1, r ≥0. Then,

Proof. By (9.74), we have for all p ≥0,

Taking the summation with respect to p ≥0, we obtain (9.79).
Similarly, we have from (9.74)

Theorem 9.12. Let F ∈L2(Rd(m+n)) with m, n ≥1. Then, there exists a
unique linear operator TF on Fb(L2(Rd)) such that D(TF ) = DS and
TF =


on DS and
∥TFΦ∥≤
√
m! ∥F∥L2∥(Nb + 1)(m+n)/2Φ∥,
Φ ∈DS ,
In particular, if F satisﬁes (9.78), then TF is a symmetric operator.
Proof. Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS . Then, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
|LF (Ψ, Φ)| ≤∥F∥L2∥KΨ,Φ∥L2.
We have
|KΨ,Φ(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn)|
=

By this inequality and Lemma 9.15, we have
∥KΨ,Φ∥2
L2 ≤m!∥Ψ∥2∥N (m+n)/2
b
Φ∥2.
Hence,
|LF(Ψ, Φ)| ≤
√
m!∥F∥L2∥Ψ∥∥(Nb + 1)(m+n)/2Φ∥.
The operator (Nb + 1)(m+n)/2 is a bijection on DS . Hence, by Theorem
2.1, there exists a unique linear operator TF on Fb(L2(Rd)) such that
D(TF ) = DS and LF = TF on DS .
□
The case where F ̸∈L2(Rd(m+n)) may also be interesting. A typical
example in such a case is given as follows. Let F be a tempered distribution
on Rd(m+n) of the following form:
F(x1, . . . , xm+n) = χ(Xm+n−p)δ(xi1 −xj1) · · · δ(xip −xjp),
where 0 ≤2p ≤m + n, 1 ≤ik, jk ≤m + n, {i1, . . . , ip} ∩{j1, . . . , jp} = ∅,
i1 < i2 < · · · < ip, and χ is a tempered distribution on Rd(m+n−p) such
648
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
that the variable Xm+n−p ∈Rd(m+n−p) does not contain xj1, . . . , xjp. In
this case, we write LF as follows:
LF =

dxj1 · · · "
dxjp · · · dxm+nχ(Xm+n−p)

$
xjk =xik,k=1,...,p,
where "
dxjk indicates the omission of dxjk and [G]xjk =xik the replacement
of xjk with xik in G.
Example 9.1. (1) Let χ be in S ′(Rd). Then,

R2d dxdyχ(x)δ(x −y)ψ(x)∗ψ(y) =

Rd dxχ(x)ψ(x)∗ψ(x).
(2) Let ϕ be in S ′(R2d). Then,

R4d dx1dx2dy1dy2ϕ(x1, y1)δ(x1 −x2)δ(y1 −y2)
×ψ(x1)∗ψ(x2)∗ψ(y1)ψ(y2)
=

R2d dxdyϕ(x, y)ψ(x)∗ψ(x)∗ψ(y)ψ(y).
As an extension of the sesquilinear form LF, one can also treat the
case where F is replaced by a partial diﬀerential operator. Here, we con-
sider only a simple case. Let P(x) be a polynomial in x1, . . . , xd ∈R
(x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈Rd). Then, the partial diﬀerential operator P(∂x) :=
P(∂1, . . . , ∂d) is deﬁned. For each Ψ ∈DS and x ∈Rd, ψ(x)Ψ ∈DS (see
Lemma 9.12). Hence, we can deﬁne P(∂x)ψ(x)Ψ ∈DS by
(P(∂x)ψ(x)Ψ)(n)(x1, . . . , xn)
:=
√
n + 1P(∂x)Ψ (n+1)(x, x1, . . . , xn), n ≥0, (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rdn.
Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS and F ∈S ′(R2d). Then, ⟨ψ(x)Ψ, P(∂y)ψ(y)Φ⟩is an
element in S (R2d) (cf. Lemma 9.13). Hence,
LP
F (Ψ, Φ) :=

R2d dxdyF(x, y) ⟨ψ(x)Ψ, P(∂y)ψ(y)Φ⟩
gives a sesquilinear form on DS . This sesquilinear form is symbolically
written as
LP
F =

R2d dxdyF(x, y)ψ(x)∗P(∂y)ψ(y).
Non-Relativistic QFT
649
In particular, in the case where F(x, y) = δ(x −y), we write

R2d dxdyδ(x −y)ψ(x)∗P(∂y)ψ(y) =

Rd dxψ(x)∗P(∂)ψ(x).

Hamiltonians as Sesquilinear Forms
In this section, we show that Hamiltonians of a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
can be deﬁned as sesquilinear forms.
9.7.1
A Hamiltonian with an external ﬁeld
Let HdB(V ) be the Hamiltonian given by (9.61).
Proposition 9.9. Suppose that S (Rd) ⊂D(V ) and V ∈S ′(Rd) in addi-
tion. Then,
HdB(V ) =

Rd ψ(x)∗

−ℏ2
2mΔ + V (x)

ψ(x)dx
(9.82)
on DS .
Proof. We denote by Δx the Laplacian in the variable x. Let Ψ, Φ ∈DS .
In quite the same way as in the proof of Proposition 9.6, one can show that
⟨Ψ, dΓb(Δx)Φ⟩=

Rd ⟨ψ(x)Ψ, Δxψ(x)Φ⟩dx.
Hence, dΓb(Δx) =
 
Rd dxψ(x)∗Δxψ(x) on DS . By Proposition 9.6, we
have
dΓb(V ) =

Rd dxψ(x)∗V (x)ψ(x)
on DS . Thus, (9.82) follows.
□
Proposition 9.9 gives a mathematically rigorous meaning to the heuristic
form “
 
Rd ψ(x)∗
−ℏ2
2mΔ + V (x)

ψ(x)dx” for the Hamiltonian of a quan-
tum de Broglie ﬁeld in a classical external ﬁeld V which, appears in the
physics literature on QFT.
9.7.2
A Hamiltonian of a self-interacting quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld
We next consider a self-interacting quantum de Broglie ﬁeld. Let U be a
real-valued Borel measurable function on Rd × Rd which is a.e. ﬁnite with
650
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
respect to the 2d-dimensional Lebesgue measure and symmetric: U(x, y) =
U(y, x), a.e. (x, y) ∈R2d. For n ≥2, we deﬁne
U (n)(x1, . . . , xn) :=

1≤i<j≤n
U(xi, xj)
= 1
2
n

i,j=1
i̸=j
U(xi, xj),
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rdn.
Physically, U (n) describes an interaction of n quantum particles.
Example 9.2. In the case d = 3, the Coulomb potential between two
charged particles with electric charge q ∈R and q′ ∈R, respectively, is
given by VC(x −y) (x, y ∈R3, x ̸= y) with
VC(x) :=
qq′
4πε0|x|,
x ∈R3 \ {0},
where ε0 > 0 denotes the dielectric constant of the vacuum (MKSA unit
system). An example of U(x, y) is given by U(x, y) = VC(x −y).
The multiplication operator U (n) on L2(Rdn) is self-adjoint. It is easy to
see that, for all n ≥2, U (n) is reduced by L2
sym((Rd)n) and its reduced part
to L2
sym((Rd)n) is the multiplication operator by the same function U (n).
The sequence {U (n)}∞
n=2 of self-adjoint operators yields the inﬁnite
direct sum operator
U := 0 ⊕0 ⊕

⊕∞
n=2U (n)
acting in the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)). By Theorem 4.2(vi), U is self-
adjoint. Physically, the operator U describes an interaction of inﬁnitely
many bosons. The Hamiltonian of a bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld which
takes into account this interaction is given by
HdB(V, U) := HdB(V ) + U.
(9.83)
This operator is reduced by each n-particle space L2
sym((Rd)n) and its
reduced part HdB(V, U)(n) is given by
HdB(V, U)(n) =

S(n)




−ℏ2
2mΔxj + V (xj)

+ U (n).
Note that S(n)
V,U with n ≥2 is an n-body Schr¨odinger operator.
Proposition 9.10. Suppose that, for all n ∈N, S(n)
V,U is self-adjoint. Then:
(i) HdB(V, U) is self-adjoint.
(ii) Let En := inf σ(S(n)
V,U) (n ∈N). Then, HdB(V, U) is bounded from
below if and only if λ0 := infn∈N En > −∞. In that case, λ0 =
inf σ(HdB(V, U)).
Proof. (i) By the above arguments, we have
HdB(V, U) = ⊕∞
n=0S(n)
V,U.
Hence, the self-adjointness of S(n)
V,U (n ∈N) implies that of HdB(V, U) (apply
Theorem 4.2(vi)).
(ii) This part follows from a simple application of Theorem 4.5(iv).
□
We next consider the case where U ∈S ′
R(R2d) and U(x, y) = U(y, x) in
the sense of tempered distribution. Then, by Example 9.1(2), the symmetric
sesquilinear form
H(U)
I
:= 1
2

R2d dxdyψ(x)∗ψ(y)∗U(x, y)ψ(x)ψ(y)
on DS is deﬁned.
Example 9.3. A physically interesting example is given by the case
U(x, y) = λδ(x −y) with λ ∈R. This is called a δ-type interaction.
But, in this case, H(U)
I
cannot be an operator on Fb(L2(Rd)).
To sum up, it has been shown that, under the aforementioned condition
for V and U,
HdB(V, U) =

2mΔ + V (x)

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
on DS in the sense of the sesquilinear form. In this way, to the heuris-
tic or informal expressions of Hamiltonians in non-relativistic QFT which
are used in the physics literature, a mathematically rigorous meaning is
given as sesquilinear forms. Moreover, the results in this section show
that the Hamiltonian HdB(V, U) gives a uniﬁcation of the standard
Hamiltonians (Schr¨odinger Hamiltonians) of many-body quantum systems
in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In this sense, for each n ∈N, the
quantum theory of the n-body system can be viewed as a part of a quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld theory.
Remark 9.7. The ﬁnite volume version of the Hamiltonian HdB(V, U) with
d = 3, V = 0 and a δ-type interaction U(x, y) = gδ(x −y) (g > 0) is used
as a Hamiltonian for superﬂuidity in the physics literature. But, in this
case, HdB(V, U) is not deﬁned as an operator on Fb(L2(VL)), where VL :=
[−L/2, L/2]3 ⊂R3 (L > 0) is the ﬁnite volume set under consideration (see
Section 9.9.1). A way to avoid this diﬃculty is to replace gδ(x −y) with a
suitable function gW(x −y) (see Section 14.2.3) and then to take a limit
W(x) →δ(x) in a suitable sense (e.g., in terms of vacuum expectation
values of the quantum ﬁelds under consideration) to construct a quantum
ﬁeld theory with the δ-type interaction.
Remark 9.8. One can consider the formal Heisenberg ﬁeld operator ψ(t, x)
( (t, x) ∈R1+d) of ψ(x) with respect to HdB(V, U):
ψ(t, x) := eitHdB(V,U)/ℏψ(x)e−itHdB(V,U)/ℏ.
Then, using the CCR of ψ(x)#, one can formally show that ψ(t, x) obeys
the following ﬁeld equation:

A Fermionic Quantum de Broglie Field
In parallel to the theory of a bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld given in
Section 9.4, we can construct a theory of a fermionic quantum de Broglie
ﬁeld, which describes non-relativistic fermions.
Non-Relativistic QFT
653
9.8.1
Hilbert space for state vectors
As mentioned in Section 5.1, a fermion has a half-integer spin s. In this case,
the state space of the spin degree of freedom is given by C2s+1. Hence,
a natural one-particle Hilbert space of a fermion with spin s moving in
the conﬁguration space Rd is given by L2(Rd; C2s+1), the Hilbert space of
C2s+1-valued square integrable functions on Rd (see Section 2.7 for this
type of Hilbert space). We have the natural isomorphism L2(Rd; C2s+1) ∼=
L2(Rd) ⊗C2s+1.
Let
S = {−s, −s + 1, . . . , s −1, s},
which is the set of eigenvalues of a spin operator, and write an element in
L2(Rd; C2s+1) as
f = (f−s, . . . , fs) = (fr)r∈S.
The function fr describes a one-particle state with spin angular momen-
tum r.
Let us construct a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with spin s on the fermion
Fock space
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) =
∞

n=0
)nL2(Rd; C2s+1)
over L2(Rd; C2s+1) (see Chapter 6). This Hilbert space is identiﬁed with
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) =
∞

n=0
L2
as(Rdn; Cn(2s+1)),
(9.86)
where L2
as(Rdn; Cn(2s+1)) is the Hilbert space of Cn(2s+1)-valued L2-
functions
Ψ = (Ψi1···in)i1,...,in∈S
satisfying that, for any permutation σ ∈Sn and a.e. (x1, . . . , xn) ∈(Rd)n,
Ψiσ(1)···iσ(n)(xσ(1), . . . , xσ(n)) = sgn(σ)Ψi1···in(x1, . . . , xn).
9.8.2
Annihilation and creation operators
We denote by c(f) (f ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1)) the annihilation operator on the
fermion Fock space Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) (see Section 6.6). As we have seen
654
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
in Chapter 6, c(f) is an everywhere deﬁned bounded linear operator on
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) and
∥c(f)∥= ∥f∥=
*
+
+
,
s

r=−s
∥fr∥2.
For each r ∈S and u ∈L2(Rd), we deﬁne a bounded operator cr(u) on
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) by
cr(u) = c

0, . . . , 0,
rth
⌣u , 0, . . . , 0

.
Then, for any f = (fr)r∈S ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1), we have
c(f) =

r∈S
cr(fr).
An application of Theorem 6.13 yields the following anti-commutation rela-
tions: for all u, v ∈L2(Rd) and r, r′ ∈S,
{cr(u), cr′(v)∗} = δrr′ ⟨u, v⟩,
{cr(u), cr′(v)} = 0,
{cr(u)∗, cr′(v)∗} = 0.
Under the identiﬁcation (9.86), cr(u) and cr(u)∗(u ∈L2(Rd)) take the
following forms: for all Ψ ∈Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)),
(cr(u)Ψ)(n)
i1···in(x1, . . . , xn)
=
√
n + 1

i1...ij···in(x1, . . . , -

n ≥1.
As in Example 8.5, one can show that the correspondence S (Rd) ∋
u →cr(u∗) (resp., cr(u)∗) is an operator-valued distribution with common
domain Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)).
9.8.3
A fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
Let U : Rd →M2s+1(C) (the set of complex (2s + 1) × (2s + 1) matrices)
such that each (r, r′)-component Urr′ of U is Borel measurable, a.e. ﬁnite
Non-Relativistic QFT
655
and U(x)∗= U(x) (Hermiteness) a.e. x ∈Rd. This kind of matrix-valued
functions on Rd is called a matrix-valued potential on Rd. Then, the
one-particle Hamiltonian of a fermion in this potential is deﬁned by
hU,s := −ℏ2
2mΔ + U
acting in L2(Rd; C2s+1) (note that (Uf)r := s
j=−s Urjfj, f ∈D(U)).
Suppose that hU,s is essentially self-adjoint. For each f ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1),
we deﬁne a fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld at time t ∈R by
ψU,s(t, f) := c(eithU,s/ℏf ∗).
In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 9.11, one can prove the following
fact:
Theorem 9.13. For all f
∈
D(hU,s) and Ψ
∈
Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)),
ψU,s(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
iℏd
dtψ(s)
U (t, f)Ψ = ψU,s(t, hU,sf)Ψ.
Using the fermion second quantization operator
HdB,s(U) := dΓf(hU,s),
we have
ψU,s(t, f) = eitHdB,s(U)/ℏψ(f)e−itHdB,s(U)/ℏ,
f ∈L2(Rd; C2s+1).
Hence, HdB,s(U) can be interpreted as a Hamiltonian in the present case.
In the case U = 0, we have
ψ0,s(t, f) = ψ(e−itℏ2Δ/2mf ∗).
This is called the free fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with
spin s.
Remark 9.9. Spectral analysis and the considerations of Galilean symme-
try in the fermionic quantum de Broglie theory can be made in quite the
same way as in the case of the bosonic one. The reader is asked to provide
their details (apply the theory of fermion Fock space given in Chapter 6).

The operator-valued distribution kernel of the
fermion annihilation operator
Let ∧0(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) be the ﬁnite particle subspace of Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1))
(see Section 6.1). Then, the subspace

i1···in ∈C((Rd)n),
n ≥1, i1, . . . , in ∈S

in Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)) is dense. For each x ∈Rd and r ∈S, we deﬁne a
linear operator cr(x) with D(cr(x)) := D(s)
C
by
(cr(x)Ψ)(n)
i1···in(x1, . . . , xn) :=
√
n + 1Ψ (n+1)
ri1···in(x, x1, . . . , xn),
Ψ ∈D(s)
C , n ≥0, i1, . . . , in ∈S.
We call cr(x) the fermion annihilation operator with spin r at the point x.
In the same way as in the case of the boson annihilation operator ψ(x)
at the point x, one can prove the following proposition.
Proposition 9.11.
(i) For all x ∈Rd and r ∈S, D(cr(x)∗) = {0}. In particular, cr(x) is not
closable.
(ii) For all Ψ ∈D(s)
C ,
 
Rd ∥cr(x)Ψ∥2dx = ∥N 1/2
f
Ψ∥2, where Nf is the
fermion number operator on Ff(L2(Rd; C2s+1)).
(iii) For all Ψ ∈D(s)
C , u ∈L2(Rd) and r ∈S,

Rd u(x)∗cr(x)Ψdx = cr(u)Ψ,
where the integral on the left-hand side is taken in the sense of strong
integral.
Remark 9.10. One can consider a fermionic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld
version of the Hamiltonian HdB(V, U) deﬁned by (9.83).
9.9
QFT on a Bounded Space Region
So far, we have considered quantum de Broglie ﬁelds on the inﬁnitely
extended space-time R1+d = R × Rd. But one can also consider those on a
bounded space region. In fact, most of the physics literature on QFT begin
Non-Relativistic QFT
657
with a QFT on a ﬁnite box in space and then take the inﬁnite volume limit
to obtain a QFT on R1+d. One of the reasons for adopting such a proce-
dure is that a QFT on R × M, with M ⊂Rd being bounded, may be less
singular, more tractable and also serve as a ﬁnite volume approximation
to a QFT on R × Rd. From a mathematical physics point of view, it may
be interesting to compare a QFT on a bounded space region with that on
R1+d. Taking into account these points of view, we describe in this section
the basic elements of a ﬁnite volume QFT.
9.9.1
QFT on a cubic box
For simplicity, we take as a bounded space region the d-dimensional cubic
box
VL :=

−L
2 , L
2
d
,
(9.87)
with L > 0 being the length of each edge. A Hilbert space of state vec-
tors of a one-particle system on VL with r internal degrees of freedom
(r ∈N) is taken to be L2(VL; Cr). The Fock space Fb(L2(VL; Cr)) (resp.,
Ff(L2(VL; Cr))) gives a framework describing bosonic (resp., fermionic)
QFT models on VL. To avoid unnecessary complexities, we consider a Bose
ﬁeld on VL with r = 1. Moreover, it turns out that it is convenient to
work with the momentum representation, which is deﬁned as follows. The
momentum space dual to VL is given by
ΓL := 2π
L Z =
2π
L n|n ∈Z

.
(9.88)
Then, the set
ℓ2(ΓL) :=
.
ψ : ΓL →C|

k∈ΓL
|ψ(k)|2 < ∞
/
,
is a Hilbert space with the inner product
⟨ψ, φ⟩:=

k∈ΓL
ψ(k)∗φ(k),
ψ, φ ∈ℓ2(ΓL).
For each k ∈ΓL, we deﬁne a function φk : VL →C by
φk(x) :=
1
Ld/2 eik·x,
x ∈VL
(9.89)
It is well known that {φk|k ∈ΓL} is a CONS of L2(VL). Hence, there
exists a unique unitary transformation F (L)
d
: L2(VL) →ℓ2(ΓL), called the
658

discrete Fourier transform, such that, for all f ∈L2(VL) and k ∈ΓL,
ˆf(k) := F (L)
d
f(k) = ⟨φk, f⟩L2(VL).
(9.90)
Hence,
Γb(F (L)
d
)Fb(L2(VL)) = Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
In this way, Fb(L2(VL)) is naturally isomorphic to Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
In what follows, we use the natural identiﬁcation of ⊗n
s ℓ2(ΓL) with
the Hilbert space ℓ2
sym(Γn
L) consisting of functions ψ(n) ∈ℓ2(Γn
L) which is
symmetric (see Section 2.11): for all (k1, . . . , kn) ∈Γn
L and σ ∈Sn,
ψ(n)(kσ(1), . . . , kσ(n)) = ψ(n)(k1, . . . , kn).
Hence, Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) is identiﬁed with ⊕∞
n=0ℓ2
sym(Γn
L) (ℓ2
sym(Γ0
L) := C).
For each k ∈ΓL, one can deﬁne an operator aL(k) on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) as
follows:
D(aL(k)) :=

Ψ ∈Fb(ℓ2(ΓL))

√
n + 1Ψ (n+1)(k, k1, . . . , kn),
Ψ ∈D(aL(k)), (k1, . . . , kn) ∈Γn
L, n ≥0.
Note that aL(k) is a discrete analogue of ψ(x) deﬁned by (9.64). However,
in contrast to ψ(x), aL(k) is a closed linear operator (Problem 10). It is
easy to see that Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) ⊂D(aL(k)). Hence, aL(k) is a densely deﬁned
closed operator. Moreover, it is shown that the adjoint aL(k)∗is given by
the following form: Ψ ∈D(aL(k)∗) if and only if

Using these formulae, one can show that aL(k)# leaves Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) invari-
ant satisfying the canonical commutation relations: for all k, k′ ∈ΓL,
[aL(k), aL(k′)∗] = δkk′,
[aL(k), aL(k′)] = 0,
[aL(k)∗, aL(k′)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
Let aL(f) be the annihilation operator with test vector f ∈ℓ2(ΓL) on
Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) (we distinguish aL(f) from aL(k) by their arguments). Then,
for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) and f ∈ℓ2(ΓL),
aL(f)Ψ =

aL(k)# = aL(δk)#,
(9.91)
where δk ∈ℓ2(ΓL) is deﬁned by δk(k′) := δkk′, k′ ∈ΓL.

This shows a big diﬀerence between the ﬁnite volume theory and the

The time-t bosonic de Broglie ﬁeld is deﬁned by

Note that SL includes the subspace
ℓ0(ΓL) := {f : ΓL →C|∃K > 0 such that if |k| ≥K, then f(k) = 0}
which is dense in ℓ2(ΓL). Hence, SL is dense in ℓ2(ΓL).
Lemma 9.16. Let g : ΓL →C be such that, for some α ≥0,

k∈ΓL
|g(k)|2
(1 + k2)α < ∞.

Since Ψ (n+1) ∈ˆ⊗

For all N > d/2, the right-hand side is ﬁnite. Thus, S < ∞.

Remark 9.11. As for the creation operator aL(k)∗, Lemma 9.16 does not
hold (e.g., 
k∈ΓL g(k)aL(k)∗Ωℓ2(ΓL) converges if and only if g ∈ℓ2(ΓL)).
In this sense, aL(k)∗is singular compared to aL(k).
Example 9.4. If g is bounded on ΓL with C := supk∈ΓL |g(k)| < ∞, then

k∈ΓL
|g(k)|2
(1 + k2)d ≤C2 


k∈ΓL
|g(k)|∥aL(k)Ψ∥< ∞.

Proposition 9.13. Let f ∈L2(VL) ∩L1(VL) and t ∈R. Then, for all

A natural embedding of the ﬁnite volume theory into
an inﬁnite one
We now consider the inﬁnite volume limit L →∞of the ﬁnite volume
theory in the preceding section. For this purpose, we ﬁrst show that there
is a natural embedding of the ﬁnite volume theory into the inﬁnite one
described in terms of the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) over L2(Rd
k). A key
idea is to note that the one-particle Hilbert space ℓ2(ΓL) in the ﬁnite volume
theory is isometrically embedded into L2(Rd
k) in a natural way, as shown
in the following.
For each k ∈ΓL, we deﬁne a set
CL(k) :=

k1 −π
L, k1 + π
L

× · · · ×

kd −π
L, kd + π


⊂Rd,
a cubic box with center k and the length of each edge being 2π/L, and
ek,L :=
 L
2π
d/2
χCL(k),
k ∈ΓL,
where χCL(k) is the characteristic function of CL(k). Then, it is easy to see
that {ek,L|k ∈ΓL} is an orthonormal system in L2(Rd). Each f ∈ℓ2(ΓL)
satisﬁes that 
k∈ΓL |f(k)|2 < ∞. Hence,
JLf :=

k∈ΓL
f(k)ek,L
converges in L2(Rd) and
∥JLf∥2
L2(Rd) =

k∈ΓL
|f(k)|2 = ∥f∥2
ℓ2(ΓL).
Non-Relativistic QFT
665
Hence, the mapping JL : ℓ2(ΓL) →L2(Rd) (f →JLf) is an isometry. Let
ML(Rd) := {f ∈L2(Rd)|for each k ∈ΓL, f ↾CL(k) is a constant}.
Then, it is easy to see that
RanJL = ML.
Hence, ℓ2(ΓL) is isomorphic to ML. Therefore, the boson Fock space
Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) is isomorphic to the boson Fock space Fb(ML) under the uni-
tary transformation
UL := Γb(JL) : Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) →Fb(ML).
We denote by a(f) (f ∈L2(Rd)) the annihilation operator with test
vector f on Fb(L2(Rd)) and, for each k ∈ΓL, we deﬁne an operator AL(k)
on Fb(L2(Rd)) by
AL(k) := a(ek,L).
Then, it is easy to see that the following canonical commutation relations
hold on Fb,0(L2(Rd)): for all k, k′ ∈ΓL,
[AL(k), AL(k′)∗] = δkk′,
(9.94)
[AL(k), AL(k′)] = 0,
[AL(k)∗, AL(k′)∗] = 0.
(9.95)
Since ML is a closed subspace of L2(Rd), it follows that Fb(ML) can be
regarded as a subspace of Fb(L2(Rd)) in a natural way. Let pL : L2(Rd) →
ML be the orthogonal projection onto ML. Then, by Theorem 5.7(v),
PL := Γb(pL)
is the orthogonal projection from Fb(L2(Rd)) onto Fb(ML).
Lemma 9.17. For each k ∈ΓL, AL(k)# is reduced by Fb(ML) and
ULaL(k)#U −1
L
= AL(k)#
as operator equalities on Fb(ML).
Proof. The reducibility of AL(k)# by Fb(ML) follows from Theorem 5.16.
By (9.91) and Theorem 5.32,
ULaL(k)#U −1
L
= a(JLδk)# = a(ek,L)# = AL(k)#
as an operator equality in Fb(ML).
□
666
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We next consider the transformation of a second quantization operator
on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) under UL.
For each p ∈Rd, there is a unique point pL ∈ΓL such that p ∈CL(pL).
For each f ∈C(Rd), we deﬁne fΓL : ΓL →C by
fΓL(k) := f(k),
k ∈ΓL.
We also introduce a function fL : Rd →C by
fL(p) := f(pL),
p ∈Rd.
It is obvious that fL ↾ΓL = fΓL. Note also that
fL =

k∈ΓL
f(k)χCL(k).
(9.96)
Lemma 9.18. Let E ∈C(Rd) and denote the multiplication operators
by the functions EΓL and EL by the same symbols, respectively. Then,
JLEΓL J−1
L
= EL as an operator equality on ML.
Proof. Let f ∈ML ∩D(EL). Then, for all p ∈Rd,
(JLEΓL J−1
L f)(p) =

k∈ΓL
E(k)(J−1
L f)(k)ek,L(p)
= E(pL)(J−1
L f)(pL)epL,L(p) = EL(p)f(p).
Thus, the desired result follows.
□
For a densely deﬁned closable operator T on L2(Rd), we denote by
dΓb(T ) the second quantization of T on Fb(L2(Rd)).
Theorem 9.16. ULdΓ(L)
b (EΓL )U −1
L
= dΓb(EL) as an operator equality on
Fb(ML).
Proof. We have Theorem 5.9 and Lemma 9.18
ULdΓ(L)
b (EΓL )U −1
L
= dΓb(JLEΓLJ−1
L ) = dΓb(EL)
as an operator equality on Fb(ML).
□
Thus, we see that the the ﬁnite volume theory (Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), {aL(k),
aL(k)∗|k ∈ΓL}, dΓ(L)
b (EΓL )) is equivalent to the theory (Fb(ML),
{AL(k), AL(k)∗|k ∈ΓL}, dΓb(EL)). Since Fb(ML) is a closed sub-
space of the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd)) which is a Hilbert space for
Non-Relativistic QFT
667
an inﬁnite volume theory, it may be convenient to consider the inﬁ-
nite volume limit of the ﬁnite volume theory in terms of the theory
(Fb(ML), {AL(k), AL(k)∗|k ∈ΓL}, dΓb(EL)).
9.9.3
Inﬁnite volume limit
Lemma 9.19. Let f ∈C(Rd). Then, for all p ∈Rd, limL→∞fL(p) =
f(p).
Proof. Let p ∈Rd be ﬁxed. Then, by the continuity of f on Rd, for any
ε > 0, there exists a constant δ > 0 such that, if p′ ∈Rd, |p′ −p| < δ,
then |f(p′) −f(p)| < ε. We have |pL −p| ≤2π
√
d/L. Hence, letting
L0 := 2π
√
d/δ, we have |fL(p) −f(p)| = |f(pL) −f(p)| < ε for all L > L0.
Thus, limL→∞fL(p) = f(p).
□
The following lemma plays an important role in taking the inﬁnite vol-
ume limit L →∞.
Lemma 9.20. Let f ∈C0(Rd). Then,
lim
L→∞

k∈ΓL
f(k)
2π
L
d
=

Rd f(p)dp.
(9.97)
Proof. There exists a constant R > 0 such that supp f ⊂[−R, R]d for
some R > 0. Let L > 1. Then, supp fL ⊂K := [−R −2π, R + 2π]d. Since
the function fL is a step function (see (9.96)), it follows that

Rd fL(p)dp =

k∈ΓL
f(k)
2π
L
d
.
We have |fL(p)| ≤∥f∥∞= supp∈Rd |f(p)| < ∞. Every constant function
on K is integrable on K. Hence, by Lemma 9.19 and the Lebesgue domi-
nated convergence theorem, we obtain
lim
L→∞

Rd fL(p)dp =

Rd f(p)dp.
Thus, (9.97) holds.

Proof. It is obvious that fL and f are in L2(Rd). Let K ⊂Rd be as in the
proof of Lemma 9.20. Then,
∥fL −f∥2
L2(Rd) =

K
g(L)(p)dp.
with g(L)(p) := |fL(p)−f(p)|2. By Lemma 9.19, limL→∞g(L)(p) = 0, ∀p ∈
Rd. Moreover,
0 ≤g(L)(p) ≤2(|fL(p)|2 + |f(p)|2) ≤2(∥f∥2
∞+ |f(p)|2)
and
 
K 2(∥f∥2

vergence theorem, limL→∞
 
K g(L)(p)dp = 0. Thus, (9.98) holds.

(A) Convergence of the creation and annihilation operators
For each function f ∈C0(Rd), we deﬁne
AL(f) :=

This suggests that AL(f) may have an inﬁnite volume limit in a suitable
sense. Indeed, one has the following theorem. We denote by Nb the number
operator on Fb(L2(Rd)).
Theorem 9.17. For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

(9.99)
Proof. It is easy to see that
AL(f) = a(fL).

Hence, D(N 1/2

b
),
∥AL(f)#Ψ −a(f)#Ψ∥≤∥fL −f∥L2(Rd)∥(Nb + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
where we have used (8.1) and (8.2). By Lemma 9.21, the right-hand side
converges to 0 as L →∞. Thus, (9.99) holds.
□
(B) Convergence of free Hamiltonians
Let E ∈C(Rd). Then, C0(Rd) ⊂D(EL) ∩D(E).
Lemma 9.22. For all f ∈C0(Rd), limL→∞ELf = Ef.
Proof. There exists a number R > 0 such that supp f ⊂[−R, R]d. Then,
for all p ∈supp f, pL ∈[−R −2π, R + 2π]d (L > 1). We have
∥ELf −Ef∥2 =

supp f
GL(p)dp,
where GL(p) := (E(pL) −E(p))2 |f(p)|2. By Lemma 9.19, limL→∞GL
(p) = 0. Putting M := supp∈[−R−2π,R+2π]d |E(p)|, we have
|GL(p)| ≤4M 2|f(p)|2,
p ∈supp f.
Hence, by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
lim
L→∞

supp f
GL(p)dp = 0.
Thus, limL→∞∥ELf −Ef∥2 = 0.
□
Theorem 9.18. Let E be a real-valued continuous function on Rd. Then:
(i) The operator dΓb(EL) converges to dΓb(E) in the strong resolvent
sense as L →∞, i.e., for all z ∈C \ R,
s- lim
L→∞(dΓb(EL) −z)−1 = (dΓb(E) −z)−1,
where s-lim means strong limit.
(ii) For all t ∈R, s-limL→∞e−itdΓb(EL)/ℏ= e−itdΓb(E)/ℏ.
(iii) If E ≥0, then, for all β > 0, s-limL→∞e−βdΓb(EL) = e−βdΓb(E).

Proof. The subspace C0(Rd) is a core for the multiplication operator E.
By this fact and Lemma 9.22, we can apply Theorem 5.20 to obtain the
desired results.
□
As for the norm resolvent convergence of {dΓb(EL)}L, we have the
following theorem.
Theorem 9.19. Let E be a non-negative continuous function on Rd. Sup-
pose that, for each L > 1, there exists a constant εL > 0 such that
limL→∞εL = 0 and
|EL(p) −E(p)| ≤εLE(p),
p ∈Rd.
Then:
(i) The operator dΓb(EL) converges to dΓb(E) in the norm resolvent sense
as L →∞.
(ii) For all β > 0, s- limL→∞∥e−βdΓb(EL) −e−βdΓb(E)∥= 0.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(C0(Rd)). Then, Ψ ∈D(dΓb(E)) ∩D(dΓb(EL)) for
all L > 0 and

is a core for dΓb(E). Hence, we can apply Theorem 1.51 to conclude that
part(i) holds. Part (ii) follows from (i) and Corollary 1.9(iii).

Non-Relativistic QFT

Example 9.5. The energy of a free relativistic particle of mass m > 0 with
momentum ℏk ∈Rd is given by
ER(k) =

ℏ2k2 + m2
in the physical unit system where the light speed c = 1. For all k, q ∈Rd,
we have
|ER(k) −ER(q)| =
|k2 −q2|
√
ℏ2k2 + m2 +

ℏ2q2 + m2
= C(k, q)| |k| −|q| |ER(k),
where
C(k, q) :=
ℏ2(|k| + |q|)
ℏ2k2 + m2 +

(ℏ2q2 + m2)(ℏ2k2 + m2)
.
Using the obvious inequality |p| ≤

p2 + m2, p ∈Rd, one can show that
C(k, q) ≤2ℏ/m. Moreover,
| |kL| −|k| | ≤|kL −k| ≤2π

.
Hence,
|ER(kL) −ER(k)| ≤εLER(k)
with εL := 4πℏ
√
d/Lm. It is obvious that εL →0 (L →∞). Hence, the
function ER satisﬁes the assumption of Theorem 9.19. Thus, in the present
example, The conclusions of Theorem 9.19 hold.
(C) Convergence of the Hamiltonians of the free quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld on VL
Let ENR be deﬁned by (9.35) and deﬁne
ˆH(L)
dB := dΓb(ENR,L),
where ENR,L(p) := ENR(pL), p ∈Rd. Then, by Theorem 9.16, ˆH(L)
dB
↾
Fb(ML) ∩D(dΓb(ENR,L)) is unitarily equivalent to the Hamiltonian H(L)
dB
of the free quantum de Broglie ﬁeld on VL. Applying Theorem 9.18 to the
case of E = ENR, we obtain the following corollary (note that ENR ≥0).
672
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Corollary 9.2. Let ˆHdB be deﬁned by (9.38).
(i) The operator ˆH(L)
dB converges to ˆHdB in the strong resolvent sense as
L →∞.
(ii) For all t ∈R, s- limL→∞e−it ˆ

HdB/ℏ.
(iii) For all β > 0, s- limL→∞e−β ˆ

HdB.
Part (ii) in Corollary 9.2 tells us that the time development in the
ﬁnite volume theory converges to that in the inﬁnite volume theory as
L →∞. Theorem 9.17 and Corollary 9.2 show that the ﬁnite vol-
ume theory presented here is a suitable one approximating the inﬁnite
volume theory.
Remark 9.12. It is easy to see that
|ENR,L(k) −ENR(k)| ≤ℏ2π
√
d
mL
(|kL| + |k|),
k ∈Rd.
But there exists no constant C > 0 such that |kL| + |k| ≤CENR(k), k ∈
Rd · · · (∗) (suppose that (∗) holded. Then, for all k ∈CL(0)\{0}, kL = 0 so
that 1 ≤ℏ2C|k|/2m. But this is a contradiction). This suggests that ˆH(L)
dB
does not converge to ˆHdB in the norm resolvent sense as L →∞. Indeed
this is true, but we omit proving this fact (Problem 13).

Hamiltonians of interacting quantum ﬁeld models on Rd (see, for example,

Rd |V (x)| |u(t, x)|2dx < ∞,

Rd |u(t, x)|4dx < ∞.
(iii) Let
N :=

Rd J0(t, x)dx
and ˙u(t, x) := ∂u(t, x)/∂t. Suppose that, for each T
> 0,
 
Rd sup|t|<T | ˙u(t, x)u(t, x)|dx < ∞· · · (∗). Show that dN/dt = 0,
i.e., N is independent of t ∈R.
Remark. The condition (∗) is a suﬃcient condition under which N is
diﬀerentiable in t ∈(−T, T ) and dN/dt =

Rd ∂J0(t, x)/∂tdx (inter-
changeability between d/dt and

Rd dx). The function J0(t, x) may be
interpreted as a space density of the matter-wave u at time t. The
above conclusion means that the total matter quantity N is constant
in time, i.e., it is conserved.

Show that dH/dt = 0, i.e., H is independent of t ∈R.

1
2mf
|∇u(t, x)|2 + V (x)|u(t, x)|2 + λ
2 |u(t, x)|4
for H denotes the energy density of the system under consideration.
Hence, H is interpreted as the total energy of the matter-wave. The
conclusion in (iii) means that the total energy is conserved. In classical
ﬁeld theory, H is called the Hamiltonian for the classical ﬁeld u
obeying the Gross–Pitaevskii equation under consideration.
(v) Consider the case where V = 0 and let
P j := −iℏ

Rd u(t, x)∗∂ju(t, x)dx, j = 1, . . . , d.
Note that the integrand u∗∂ju is integrable by the integral con-

Rd sup
|t|<T

Rd |Δu(t, x)| |∂ju(t, x)|dx < ∞,

Rd |u(t, x)|3|∂ju(t, x)|dx < ∞.
Show that dP j/dt = 0 (j = 1, . . . , d).
Remark. In the context of matter-wave theory, the integrand −iℏu∗
∂ju = u∗ˆpju for P j denotes the jth component of the momentum
density. Hence, P j is interpreted as the jth component of the total
momentum of the matter-wave. The conclusion in (iv) means that,
under the condition that no external ﬁeld exists, the total momentum
(P 1, . . . , P d) is conserved.
(vi) For each j, k = 1, . . . , d, j ̸= k, we deﬁne an operator
ljk := −iℏ(xjDk −xkDj) = xj ˆpk −xk ˆpj
as a linear operator from C1(Rd) to C(Rd).
(a) Let F ∈C1(Rd) be rotation invariant, i.e., there exists a
function φ ∈C1([0, ∞)) such that F(x) = φ(|x|), x ∈Rd.
Show that, for all f ∈C1(Rd), ljk(Ff) = Fljkf.
(b) Show that, for all f ∈C3(Rd), ljk(Δf) = Δ(ljkf).
676
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Remark. In the context of quantum mechanics, ljk as an operator act-
ing in L2(Rd) represents the (j, k)-component of the orbital angular
momentum.
(vii) In addition to the above conditions for u, assume that

Rd |x| |u(t, x)| |∂ju(t, x)|dx < ∞, j = 1, . . . , d,
and let
Ljk :=

Suppose that V is continuously diﬀerentiable and rotation invari-
ant. Show that, under suitable additional conditions (formulate
them), Ljk is conserved, i.e., dLjk/dt = 0.
Remark. In classical ﬁeld theory, the integrand u(t, x)∗ljku(t, x) for
Ljk means the density of (j, k)-component of the orbital angular
momentum of the classical ﬁeld u. Hence, Ljk is the (j, k)-component
of the total orbital angular momentum.
(2) Consider the same items as in the preceding problem in the case of
the following generalized Gross–Pitaevskii equation:
i∂u(t, x)

where P(x) = n
j=2 ajxj, x ∈R (n ≥2) and aj ∈R (j = 2, . . . , d) is
a constant) and P ′ is the derivative of P.
(3) For each R ∈O(d), deﬁne η(R) : L2(Rd) →L2(Rd) by (η(R)f)(x) :=
f(R−1x), f ∈L2(Rd), a.e. x ∈R. Show that {η(R)}R∈O(d) is a
strongly continuous unitary representation of O(d).
(4) For a Galilei transformation g = (R, v, a) ∈G1+d and a non-zero
constant μ ∈R \ {0}, deﬁne π(g) : L2(R1+d) →L2(R1+d) by
(π(g)f)(x) := eiμ(v·x−1

f ∈L2(R1+d), x = (x0, x) ∈R1+d.
Non-Relativistic QFT

(i) Show that π(g) is unitary and strongly continuous in g.
(ii) Suppose that f is in C1-class in x0 and C2-class in x. Let fg :=
π(g)f. Show that
i∂0fg(x) + 1
2μΔfg(x)

(iii) Suppose that f obeys the partial diﬀerential equation, a nonlin-
ear de Broglie–Schr¨odinger equation.
i∂0f(x) = −1
2μΔf(x) + V (x)f(x) + U(|f(x)|)f(x),
(9.101)
where V : R1+d →C and U : [0, ∞) →C. Show that
i∂0fg(x) = −1
2μΔfg(x) + V (g−1x)fg(x) + U(|fg(x)|)fg(x).
Remark. This result shows that, if V is g-invariant, i.e., V (g−1x) =
V (x) for all x ∈R1+d, then, for any solution f to (9.101), fg is a
solution to (9.101). This property is called the g-symmetry of the space
of solutions to (9.101). An interesting fact here is that the phase factor
eiμ(v·x−1
2 v2x0) is needed to ensure the g-symmetry.
(iv) Show that π(gg′) = eiμ(Rv′·(a−a0v)−1
2 v′2a0)π(g)π(g′), g, g′
∈
G1+d.
Remark. In general, a representation ρ of a group G on a Hilbert space
is called a ray representation of G if, for each pair (g, g′) ∈G × G,
there exists a constant c(g, g′) ∈C such that ρ(gg′) = c(g, g′)ρ(g)ρ(g′). The
function c : G×G →C : (g, g′) →c(g, g′) is called the 2-cocycle associated
with the ray representation. The fact stated in (iv) shows that {π(g)|g ∈
G1+d} is a ray representation of G1+d. A moral of (iii) and (iv) is that the
solution space of the nonlinear de Broglie–Schr¨odinger equation (9.101) is
invariant under the ray representation {π(g)|g ∈G1+d} (a non-unitary one)
if V is Galilei invariant (i.e., for all g ∈G1+d, V is g-invariant).
(5) Consider the case d = 3 and let
l1 := x2ˆp3 −x3ˆp2, l2 := x3ˆp1 −x1ˆp3, l3 := x1ˆp2 −x2ˆp1,
acting in L2(R3). The operator vector (l1, l2, l3) is called the three-
dimensional orbital angular momentum operator. Let Mj :=

Remark. In the notation of Problem 1(v), l1 = l23, l2 = l31, l3 = l12.
(6) Let {η(R)|R ∈SO(3)} be as in Problem 3 with d = 3. Let
U(R) := Γb(η(R))
acting on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(R3)). Then, by Corollary 5.2,
{U(R)|R ∈SO(3)} is a strongly continuous unitary representation of
SO(3). For j = 1, 2, 3, we denote by Rj(θ) the rotation of angle θ ∈R
around the xj-axis:
(Rjx)j = xj,
(Rjx)k = xk cos θ −xl sin θ,
(Rjx)l = xk sin θ + xl cos θ,
where (jkl) = (123), (231), (312). Let Mj (j = 1, 2, 3) be as in the
preceding problem. Show that
U(Rj(θ)) = e−iMjθ/ℏ, j = 1, 2, 3.
(7) Let ψ(t, f) (t ∈R, f ∈L2(Rd)) be the free bosonic quantum de Broglie

Free Classical Klein–Gordon Field
In this chapter, we construct a quantum ﬁeld whose corresponding classical
ﬁeld is given by a scalar ﬁeld (scalar-valued function) φcl : R1+d →K
(d ∈N) obeying the free Klein–Gordon (KG) equation

φcl(x) = 0,
x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd) = (x0, x) ∈R1+d,
(10.1)
where □is the (1 + d)-dimensional d’Alembertian (see (8.74)), c > 0 is
the speed of light and m ≥0 is a parameter denoting the associated boson
mass. The function φcl is called the free classical Klein–Gordon ﬁeld
on the space-time R1+d. In the case of K = R (resp., C), φcl is said to be
real (resp., complex, or charged).
We ﬁrst consider the case where φcl is real. A heuristic argument to ﬁnd
a general solution to (10.1) is as follows. Let
ˆφcl(x0, k) := (2π)−d/2

Rd e−ik·xφ(x0, x)dx
be the d-dimensional Fourier transform of φ(x0, ·), where

k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd.

Then, taking the Fourier transform of (10.1) in the variable x, one ﬁnds
∂2
0 ˆφcl(x0, k) = −ω(k)2 ˆφcl(x0, k)
under a suitable condition for φcl, where
ω(k) :=

k2 + (mc/ℏ)2.
(10.2)
Hence,
ˆφcl(x0, k) = C1(k)eix0ω(k) + C2(k)e−ix0ω(k).
Here, C1(k) and C2(k) are constants which may depend on k, but inde-
pendent of x0. The reality of φcl implies that ˆφcl(x0, k)∗= ˆφcl(x0, −k).
It follows that C1(k)∗= C2(−k). Hence, letting A(k) :=

2ω(k)C2(k)
(the multiplication of

2ω(k) is just for convenience) and using the Fourier
inversion formula φcl(x) = (2π)−d/2 	
Rd eix·k ˆφcl(x0, k)dk, one ﬁnds that a
general real-valued solution to (10.1) is of the form

In the case of m > 0 (resp., m = 0), the ﬁeld φcl is said to be massive
(resp., massless).
In the Lagrangian formalism of classical ﬁeld theory,1 the Lagrangian

the canonical conjugate momentum πcl of φcl is given by
πcl(x) := ∂L (x)
∂˙φcl(x)
= 1
c2 ˙φcl(x).

(1980), and Itzykson and Zuber (1980). But the reader who is unfamiliar with this
subject needs only to note the form of the canonical conjugate momentum πcl given as

In the scheme of canonical quantization formalism, φcl and πcl should
be replaced by sharp-time operator-valued distributions φ(t, f) and π(t, f)
(t ∈R, f ∈SR(Rd)) such that, for all t ∈R and f, g ∈SR(Rd), the
following equal-time Heisenberg CCRs hold on a suitable subspace in the
Hilbert space of their representation (cf. Remark (1) for Deﬁnition 8.2):
[φ(t, f), π(t, g)] = iℏ

Rd f(x)g(x)dx,
[φ(t, f), φ(t, g)] = 0, [π(t, f), π(t, g)] = 0.
Heuristically, these operator-valued distributions are constructed by replac-
ing A(k) with an operator-valued distribution, with the kernel
√

satisfying
[a(k), a(k′)∗] = δ(k −k′),
[a(k), a(k′)] = 0.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In the following section, we show that these formal (heuristic) manipu-
lations acquire mathematically meaningful forms in the theory of the boson
Fock space over L2(Rd).
10.2
A Sharp-Time Free Neutral Quantum KG Field
For notational simplicity, in what follows, we use the physical unit system
where c = 1 and ℏ= 1 unless otherwise stated.
We set Rd
k := {k = (k1, . . . , kd)|kj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d}, the wave-number-
vector space. For each f ∈L2(Rd
k), we denote by a(f) the boson annihilation
operator with test vector f on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) over
L2(Rd
k). Hence, we have the following CCR: for all f, g ∈L2(Rk),
[a(f), a(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩, [a(f), a(g)] = 0, [a(f)∗, a(g)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
For each s ∈R, we introduce a function space:
Hs
ω(Rd) := {f ∈L2(Rd)|ωs ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k)},
(10.8)
where ˆf is the Fourier transform of f and ω is deﬁned by (10.2).2 Note
that, if m > 0, then Hs
ω(Rd) is essentially same as the Sobolev space on Rd
with index s.
For each f ∈Hs
ω(Rd), we deﬁne ∥f∥s ≥0 by
∥f∥s := ∥ωs ˆf∥.
It is easy to see that, if f ∈Hs
ω(Rd), then f ∗∈Hs
ω(Rd).
We also introduce the real space version of Hs
ω(Rd):
Hs
ω,R(Rd) := {f ∈Hs
ω(Rd)|f ∗= f},
s ∈R.
(10.9)
By formally smearing out φ(t, x) and π(t, x) (see (10.6) and (10.7))
with a test function f on Rd
x, one can ﬁnd the following mathematically
well-deﬁned objects:

k)), φ(t, f)Ψ (resp., π(t, g)Ψ) is linear in f ∈
H−1/2
ω
(Rd) (resp., g ∈H1/2
ω
(Rd)).
It is easy to see that
φ(t, f ∗) ⊂φ(t, f)∗,
π(t, g∗) ⊂π(t, g)∗.
(10.12)
We remark that, in the massless case m = 0 (hence, ω(k) = |k|, k ∈Rd),
for all f ∈S (Rd), ˆf/√ω ∈L2(Rd) if and only if d ≥2. This phenomenon
is an example of the so-called infrared divergence in QFT, in which a
massless quantum ﬁeld is involved. For this reason, in what follows, we
assume that d ≥2 in the case of m = 0.
It is easy to see that, for each t ∈R, the following Heisenberg CCR hold
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)):
[φ(t, f), π(t, g)] = i

Rd f(x)g(x)dx
[φ(t, f), φ(t, g)] = 0,
[π(t, f), π(t, g)] = 0,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Theorem 10.1. Let t ∈R be ﬁxed arbitrarily. Then, for all f ∈H−1/2
ω,R (Rd)
and g
∈H1/2
ω,R(Rd), φ(t, f) and π(t, g) are essentially self-adjoint on
Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
Proof. For all f ∈H−1/2
ω,R (Rd) and g ∈H1/2
ω,R(Rd), we have
φ(t, f) = ΦS

on Fb,0(L2(Rd

k))
(see Section 5.10). Hence, by Theorem 5.23, the desired result follows.
□
Proposition 10.1. For each t ∈R, φ(t, ·) and π(t, ·) are operator-valued
distributions on Rd with common domain D(N 1/2

), where Nb is the boson
number operator on Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
Proof. We need only to show that, for all Φ, Ψ
∈
Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)),
⟨Φ, φ(t, ·)Ψ⟩and ⟨Φ, π(t, ·)Ψ⟩are in S ′(Rd). The linearity of these

To estimate ∥ω−1/2 ˆf and ∥ω−1/2

Then,

√m∥ˆf∥=

Hence, by Lemma D.1 in Appendix D, the mapping S (Rd) ∋f →∥ω−1/2

f #∥(f # = f or f ∗) is continuous in the topology of S (Rd). Therefore,
⟨Φ, φ(t, ·)Ψ⟩∈S ′(Rd).
We next consider the case m = 0 with d ≥2. In this case, we have
∥ω−1/2 
f #∥= ∥|k|−1/2 

where n > (d −1)/2 and

Hence, by Proposition D.4 in Appendix D, ∥ω−1/2 
f #∥is continuous in f
in the topology of S (Rd). Therefore, ⟨Φ, φ(t, ·)Ψ⟩∈S ′(Rd).
Similarly, one can prove that ⟨Φ, π(t, ·)Ψ⟩∈S ′(Rd).

Let
Hb := dΓb(ω)

theorem.

φ(t, f) = eitHbφ0(f)e−itHb,

π0(g) := π(0, g) =

2(a(ω1/2ˆg)∗−a(ω1/2 g∗)).
(10.16)
We now derive ﬁeld equations for φ(t, ·) and π(t, ·).
Theorem 10.3 (Field equation). Let Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
).
(i) For all f ∈H−1/2

ω
(Rd), φ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable
in t ∈R and

tiable in t ∈R and
d2
dt2 φ(t, f)Ψ + φ(t, −Δf)Ψ + m2φ(t, f)Ψ = 0.
Proof. Apply Lemma 5.22 and use the fact that
(Fd(−Δ + m2)f)(k) = ω(k)2 ˆf(k), f ∈D(Δ), a.e. k ∈Rd,
where Fd denotes the Fourier transform on L2(Rd).
□
Let φ(t, x) (resp., π(t, x)) be the operator-valued distribution kernel of
φ(t, f) (resp., π(t, f)), f ∈S (Rd):
φ(t, f) =

Rd φ(t, x)f(x)dx,
π(t, f) =

Rd π(t, x)f(x)dx.
Then, Theorem 10.3 means that
Dtφ(t, x) = π(t, x),
(□+ m2)φ(t, x) = 0
on D(N 1/2
b
) in the sense of operator-valued distribution. By these facts and
Theorem 10.1, φ(t, x) can be interpreted as a quantum version of the free
classical neutral KG ﬁeld. We call the operator-valued distribution φ(t, ·) a
sharp-time free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld with mass m and Hb the
free Hamiltonian of it (cf. also Remark for Problem 2). The operator-
valued distribution π(t, ·) is called the conjugate momentum of φ(t, ·).
Let ˆPb,j be given by (9.39) (note that, in the present case, ℏ= 1).

Pb,d · · · e−ia1 ˆ
Pb,1 = φ(t, u(a)f),
where u(a) (a ∈Rd) is deﬁned by (9.24).
Proof. Apply Lemma 5.22 and use the fact that kj = −kj and
eiajkj ˆf = Fd(eiaj ˆpjf) = Fd(u(ajej)f), j = 1, . . . , d,
where {ej ∈Rd|j = 1, . . . , d} is the standard basis of Rd.
□
Theorem 10.4 shows that the quantum ﬁeld φ(t, f) is space-translation
covariant and
ˆPb := ( ˆP 1
b, . . . , ˆP d
b ) ( ˆP j
b := −ˆPb,j) is interpreted as its
momentum operator. Thus, we see that (Fb(L2(Rd
k)), (Hb, ˆPb,1, . . . , ˆPb,d),
Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)), φ(t, ·)) is a translation covariant sharp-time QFT. We denote
by PKG the energy–momentum operator of the sharp-time free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld:
PKG := (Hb, ˆPb,1, . . . , ˆPb,d).
10.3
Representation Theoretic Aspects
Theorem 10.1 implies in particular that, for each (t, f) ∈R×SR(Rd), φ(t, f)
and π(t, f) are essentially self-adjoint. We denote their closure by φ(t, f)
and π(t, f), respectively, which are self-adjoint. For each t ∈R, we set
ρt := (Fb(L2(Rd)), {φ(t, f), π(t, f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}).
Theorem 10.5.
(i) For each t ∈R, ρt is an irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR
over SR(Rd).
(ii) For each pair (t, s) ∈R × R, ρt is equivalent to ρs.
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that ρ0 (the case t = 0) is an irreducible Weyl
representation of the CCR over SR(Rd). Let ˆCd : L2(Rd
k) →L2(Rd
k) be
deﬁned by
( ˆCd ˆf)(k) := ˆf(−k)∗,
ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k).
Then, it is easy to see that ˆCd is a conjugation and Dd := { ˆf|f ∈SR(Rd)}
is a dense subspace of H ˆ
Cd := { ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k)| ˆCd ˆf = ˆf}. Obviously, the
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
689
multiplication operator T := √ω is reduced by H ˆ
Cd. We have
φ(0, f) = φF(T −1 ˆf),
π(0, f) = πF(T ˆf).
Moreover, T Dd and T −1Dd are dense in H ˆ
Cd. Thus, we can apply Theorem
5.47 to conclude that ρ0 is an irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR
over SR(Rd).
Theorem 10.2 implies that {eiφ(t,f), eiπ(t,f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} is unitarily
equivalent to {eiφ(0,f), eiπ(0,f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}. By this fact and Proposition
5.10, ρt is an irreducible Weyl representation of the CCR over SR(Rd),
which is equivalent to ρ0.
(ii) By the proof of (i), ρt ∼= ρ0 ∼= ρs (∼= means “equivalent”).
□
Remark 10.1. To make explicit the dependence of ρ0 on the mass m ≥0,
we write ρ(m) := ρ0. It is proved that, if m1 ̸= m2 (m1, m2 ≥0), then ρ(m1)
is inequivalent to ρ(m2) (see Reed and Simon, 1975, Theorem X.46 for the
case of d = 3 and m1, m2 > 0 and Arai, 2016a for the general case; in Arai,
2016a, a general structure behind the fact is clariﬁed). Thus, {ρ(m)}m≥0
is a family of mutually inequivalent irreducible Weyl representations and
the boson masses form its index set. This is an very interesting fact which
clariﬁes the meaning of boson masses.

Let uc be given by (9.27). Then, the Fourier transform

ˆuc(eitωω−1/2
f ∗) = e−itωω−1/2 

Hence, (10.18) follows.
□
Formula (10.18) means that the time-reversal φ(−t, ucf) of the quantum
ﬁeld φ(t, f) is implementable by an anti-unitary involution.
We next consider the space-inversion for φ(t, f). Let us be deﬁned by
(9.31) and
ˆus := FdusF −1
d
.
Then, it follows that
(ˆusf)(k) = f(−k),
f ∈L2(Rd
k),
a.e. k ∈Rd.
Since ˆus is a unitary involution, so is the operator
ˆUs := Γb(ˆus)
on Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
Theorem 10.7. For all t ∈R and f ∈H−1/2
ω
(Rd),
ˆUsφ(t, f) ˆU −1
s
= φ(t, usf).
(10.19)
Proof. Using ω(k) = ω(−k), k ∈Rd, we see that
eitωω−1/2Fd(usf) = ˆus(eitωω−1/2 ˆf),
eitωω−1/2Fd(usf)∗= ˆus(eitωω−1/2
f ∗).
Hence, (10.19) follows.
□
Formula (10.19) shows that the parity-transformed ﬁeld φ(t, usf) is uni-
tarily implementable by a unitary involution.
The operator
Upc := Γb(ˆus)Γb(ˆuc) = Γb(ˆusˆuc),
is an anti-unitary involution.
Theorems 10.6 and 10.7 immediately yield the following fact.

Then,
UpcΩ0 = Ω0.
(10.22)
Corollary 10.1. Let fj ∈H−1/2
ω

⟨Ω0, φ(t1, f1) · · · φ(tn, fn)Ω0⟩
= ⟨Ω0, φ(−tn, usfn) · · · φ(−t1, usf1)Ω0⟩.
Proof. By (9.28) and (10.20), we have
φ(t, f) = Upcφ(−t, (usf)∗)U −1
pc .
(10.23)
By (10.22) and the anti-unitarity of Upc, we have, for all Ψ ∈Fb(L2(Rd
k)),
⟨Ω0, Ψ⟩= ⟨UpcΨ, UpcΩ0⟩= ⟨UpcΨ, Ω0⟩.
Hence,
⟨Ω0, φ(t1, f1) · · · φ(tn, fn)Ω0⟩
= ⟨φ(−t1, (usf1)∗) · · · φ(−tn, (usfn)∗)Ω0, Ω0⟩
= ⟨Ω0, φ(−tn, usfn) · · · φ(−t1, usf1)Ω0⟩,
where we have used the ﬁrst relation in (10.12).

Remark 10.2. In the framework of the G˚arding–Wightman axioms, the
PCT theorem is proved to hold in general. See, for example, Streater and

Energy–Momentum Spectrum
As in the case of the free bosonic quantum de Broglie ﬁeld, one can iden-
tify the spectrum of the Hamiltonian Hb of the free quantum KG ﬁeld as
follows:
σ(Hb) = {0} ∪

σp(Hb) = {0},
ker Hb = {αΩ0|α ∈C}.
The spectral properties of ˆPb,j are given by Theorem 9.6(ii). In the
present case, however, the energy–momentum spectrum, i.e., the joint
spectrum of PKG is not the direct product of σ(Hb), σ( ˆPb,1), . . ., σ( ˆPb,d−1)
and σ( ˆPb,d), as shown in the following.
Since we use the physical unit system such that c = 1 and ℏ= 1, the
hyperbolic hypersurface Vm with mass m (see (1.101)) takes the form
Vm = {k ∈(M1+d)∗|k2 = m2, k0 ≥0},
where (M1+d)∗is the dual space of the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski
space-time M1+d and k2 := k2
0 −d

For a non-negative number r ≥0, we introduce a subset V≥r of (M1+d)∗
as follows:
V≥r := {k = (k0, k) ∈(M1+d)∗|k0 ≥0, k2 ≥r2}.

We next prove the converse inclusion relation of (10.26). Let k ∈V≥2m.
The function f on Rd × Rd, deﬁned by
f(k1, k2) := ω(k1)ω(k2) −k1 · k2 (k1, k2 ∈Rd)
is continuous and, by (10.25), f(Rd×Rd) = [m2, ∞). We have k2 ≥(2m)2 =
4m2. Hence, there exist k1, k2 ∈Rd such that
k2 = 2f(k1, k2) + 2m2.
Putting ql := (ω(kl), kl), l = 1, 2 and q := q1 + q2, we have q2 = k2.
Hence, there exists a Lorentz transformation Λ ∈L ↑
+ such that k = Λq =
Λq1 + Λq2. Since q1, q2 ∈V (1)
m
= Vm, there exist k′
1, k′
2 ∈Rd such that
Λql = (ω(k′
l), k′
l), l = 1, 2. Hence, k = (ω(k′
1) + ω(k′
2), k′

m .
Therefore, V (2)
m
⊃V≥2m.
By this result and (10.26), we obtain V (2)
m
= V≥2m. Then, by (10.27),
V (2)

n=2V (n)

Theorem 10.9. The joint spectrum σJ(PKG) of PKG is identiﬁed as
follows:
σJ(PKG) = {0} ∪Vm ∪V≥2m.
(10.28)
In particular, in the massless case of m = 0,
σJ(PKG) = V +,
(10.29)
where V+ is the forward light cone (see (8.49)).
Proof. In the same way as in the proof of Lemma 9.7, one can show that
σ(PKG) = {0} ∪

According to the preceding lemma, the right-hand side is equal to that of
(10.28).
In the case of m = 0, we have V≥0 = V +. Hence, (10.29) holds.
□
Theorem 10.9 shows that
σJ(PKG) ⊂V +
and σJ(PKG) is invariant under proper Lorentz transformations.

Unitary Representation of the (1 + d)-Dimensional
Poincar´e Group on the Boson Fock Space Fb(L2(Rd
k))
In this section, we construct a strongly continuous unitary representation
of the (1 + d)-dimensional proper Poincar´e group P↑
+ (see Section 8.10.5)
on the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
We deﬁne a mapping jm : Vm →Rd by
jm(k) := k,
k = (k0, k) ∈Vm.
The mapping jm is a homeomorphism.3
The family
Bm := {B ∩Vm|B ∈B1+d}
of subsets in Vm is a Borel ﬁeld in Vm. For each E ∈Bm, one can deﬁne
μm(E) ≥0 by
μm(E) :=

jm(E)
1
ω(k)dk,
where μm(E) := ∞if the integral on the right-hand side is divergent. For
example, μm(Vm) = ∞. It is easy to see that μm is a σ-ﬁnite measure on
the measurable space (Vm, Bm).
Recall that L ↑
+ denotes the (1 + d)-dimensional proper Lorentz group
(see Section 8.10.2). An important property of μm is stated in the following
lemma.
Lemma 10.2. The measure μm is L ↑
+-invariant, i.e., for all Λ ∈L ↑
+ and
E ∈Bm,
μm(E) = μm(ΛE),
(10.30)
where d ≥2 is assumed in the case of m = 0.
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the case m > 0. For each f ∈C∞
0 (0, ∞), we deﬁne
a measure ρf on (R1+d, B1+d) by
ρf(B) := 2

B
f(k2)χ(k)dk,
B ∈B1+d,
where χ is the characteristic function of V +, the closure of the forward
light cone. It is obvious that supp ρf ⊂V +. For any Λ ∈L ↑
+, (Λk)2 = k2
3A mapping f : X →Y from a topological space X to a topological space Y is
called a homeomorphism if it is continuous and bijective, with the inverse mapping
f−1 : Y →X being continuous.
696
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(k ∈M1+d) and det Λ = 1. Moreover, V + is invariant under any proper
Lorentz transformation. Hence, ρf(B) = ρf(ΛB), i.e., ρf is an L ↑
+-invariant
measure.
Let h : V+ →[0, ∞) × Rd
k be deﬁned by
h(k) := (k2, k),
k ∈V+.
Then, h is a homeomorphism. The Jacobian D(h)/D(k) of h is easily
computed using the result
D(h)
D(k) = 2k0.
Hence, for any Borel set B ⊂V+, we have
ρf(B) =

h(B)
f(y)

y + k2 dydk.
Now, we take a function v ∈C∞
0 (R) satisfying
	
R v(y)dy = 1 and deﬁne
fn(y) := nv(n(y −m2)),
n ∈N, y ∈R.
Then, fn ∈C∞
0 (0, ∞). It is easy to see that fn(y)
S ′
−→δ(y −m2) (n →∞)
(see Example D.6 in Appendix D). Hence, for any g ∈S (R1+d),

R1+d g(k)dρfn(k) = 2

R1+d g(k)fn(k2)χ(k)dk


R1+d g(k)dρfn(k).
Hence, taking the limit n →∞, we obtain

Let B = (a0, b0] × (a1, b1] × · · · × (ad, bd] (−∞< aμ < bμ < ∞) and
set E := B ∩Vm. Then, there exists a sequence {gn}n∈N of functions in
C∞
0 (R1+d) such that ∪n∈Nsupp gn ⊂K for a bounded set K ⊂R1+d,
supn∈N supx∈R1+d |gn(x)| < ∞and gn(k) →χB(k) (n →∞) (a.e. k), where
χB is the characteristic function of B.4 By (10.31), we have

Vm
gn(Λ−1k)dμm(k) =

Vm
gn(k)dμm(k).
Taking n →∞with the application of the Lebesgue dominated convergence
theorem, we obtain
	
Vm χB(Λ−1k))dμm(k) =
	
Vm χB(k)dμm(k). Hence,
(10.30) holds. Since the Borel ﬁeld Bm is generated by sets of the form
just considered, it follows that, for all E ∈Bm, (10.30) holds.
We next show that (10.30) holds also in the case of m = 0. For this
purpose, we consider the limit m →0 in the integral

Taking m →0 in (10.31), we have

V0
g(Λ−1k)dμ0(k) =

g(k)dμ0(k).
Then, in the same way as in the case of m > 0, one can derive (10.30) with
m = 0.
□
Remark 10.3. The measure μm is heuristically or symbolically written as
dμm(k) = 2θ(k0)δ(k2 −m2)dk,
where θ(·) is the Heaviside function (Example D.4 in Appendix D) and
δ(k2 −m2) is the distribution discussed in Example D.3 in Appendix D:
δ(k2 −m2) =
1
2ω(k)(δ(k0 + ω(k)) + δ(k0 −ω(k)).
Note that k2−m2 = k2
0−ω(k)2. In the physics literature, this heuristic form
is used. Since the distribution kernel θ(k0)δ(k2 −m2) is formally Lorentz
invariant (by Proposition 8.5), one infers that μm is L ↑
+-invariant. Lemma
10.2 gives a mathematically rigorous formulation and a proof of this guess.
In what follows, we set
˜k := (ω(k), k),
k ∈Rd
and, for each Λ ∈L ↑
+, we deﬁne kΛ = (k1
Λ, . . . , kd
Λ) ∈Rd by
kj
Λ := (Λ−1˜k)j,
j = 1, . . . , d.
Then, using the fact that (Λ−1˜k)2 = ˜k2 = m2 and (Λ−1˜k)0 ≥0 (by
Proposition 8.5), we have
ω(kΛ) = (Λ−1˜k)0.
Hence,
Λ−1˜k = (ω(kΛ), kΛ).
For each (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+, we deﬁne a linear operator u(a, Λ) on L2(Rd
k) by
(u(a, Λ)f)(k) = eia˜k

ω(kΛ)
ω(k) f(kΛ).
(10.32)
Proposition 10.2. The set {u(a, Λ)|(a, Λ) ∈P↑
+} is a strongly continuous
unitary representation of P↑
+.
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
699
Proof. (i) Isometric property. Let f ∈L2(Rd
k) and g(k) := k0|f(k)|2
(k = (k0, k) ∈R1+d). Then,
∥u(a, Λ)f∥2 =

Rd dkω(kΛ)
ω(k) |f(kΛ)|2dk =

Vm
g(Λ−1k)dμm(k).
By Lemma 10.2, the right-hand side is equal to
	
Vm g(k)dμm(k)
=
	
Rd |f(k)|2dk. Hence, u(a, Λ) is an isometry.
(ii) Group property and unitarity. For all (a1, Λ1), (a2, Λ2) ∈P↑
+ and
a.e. k ∈Rd,
(u(a1, Λ1)u(a2, Λ2)f)(k) = eia1˜k

ω(kΛ1)
ω(k) (u(a2, Λ2)f)(kΛ1)

ω(k)
f((kΛ1)Λ2)
= ei(a1+Λ1a2)˜k

ω((kΛ1)Λ2)
ω(k)
f((kΛ1)Λ2).
It is easy to see that
Λ−1
2 Λ−1
1 ˜k = (ω((kΛ1)Λ2), (kΛ1)Λ2).
Note that Λ−1
2 Λ−1
1
= (Λ1Λ2)−1. Hence, it follows that
(u(a1, Λ1)u(a2, Λ2)f)(k) = (u(a1 + Λ1a2, Λ1Λ2)f)(k)
= (u((a1, Λ1)(a2, Λ2))f)(k).
Therefore,
u(a1, Λ1)u(a2, Λ2) = u((a1, Λ1)(a2, Λ2)).
This shows that the mapping u : P↑
+ ∋(a, Λ) →u(a, Λ) is a representation
of P↑
+. In particular, taking (a2, Λ2) = (a1, Λ1)−1, we have
u(a1, Λ1)u((a1, Λ1)−1) = I.
Hence, u(a1, Λ1) is bijective. Thus, u(a, Λ) is unitary.
(iii) Strong continuity. Let (an, Λn), (a, Λ) ∈P↑

(ii) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑

(iii) If a vector Ψ ∈Fb(L2(Rd

Ψ = λΩ0, for some constant λ ∈C.
Proof. (i) This follows from Corollary 4.3.
(ii) This follows from the deﬁnition of Γb(·).
(iii) The present assumption and (10.34) imply that, for all t ∈R,

A Free Neutral Quantum KG Field Smeared over the
Space-Time
Following the prescription for the construction of a totally smeared
quantum ﬁeld from a sharp-time one (see Section 8.3.3), we can construct
a free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld as an operator-valued distribution on
R1+d
x
= {x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd)|xμ ∈R, μ = 0, . . . , d}. Formally smearing
φ(x) given by (10.6) with f ∈S (R1+d
x
), we see that the following operator
may be a candidate for the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld:
φ(f) := √π


(2π)1+d

R1+d eiω(k)t−ik·xf(t, x)dt dx.
(10.36)
To see that (10.35) is well deﬁned, we have to prove that Ff #/√ω ∈
L2(Rd
k). We have the following lemma.
Lemma 10.3. For all f ∈S (R1+d
x
) and n ∈Z+, there exists a constant
C(n, f) > 0 such that
(1 + |k|)n|(Ff)(k)| ≤C(n, f),
k ∈Rd
k.
(10.37)
Proof. Let ˆf be the (1 + d)-dimensional Fourier transform of f. Then, we
have
(Ff)(k) = ˆf(−ω(k), k)),
k ∈Rd
k.
(10.38)
Since ˆf ∈S (R1+d
k
), for all n ∈Z+, there exists a constant C(n, f) > 0
such that
(1 + |k|)n| ˆf(k)| ≤C(n, f),
k = (k0, k) ∈R1+d
k
.
Since (1 + |k|)n ≥(1 + |k|)n, (10.37) follows.
□
By (10.37), one has
(Ff)(k)

ω(k)
≤
C(n, f)

ω(k)(1 + |k|)n .
One can take n > (d −1)/2 so that 	
Rd ω(k)−1(1 + |k|)−2ndk < ∞. Hence,
Ff/√ω ∈L2(Rd
k). Since f ∗∈S (R1+d
x
), we conclude that Ff ∗/√ω ∈
L2(Rd
k). Thus, φ(f) is well deﬁned as an operator acting in Fb(L2(Rd
k)).

Lemma 10.5. The mapping φ : S (R1+d

an operator-valued distribution with common domain D(N 1/2

D(φ(f)) ∩D(φ(f)∗) ⊃D(N 1/2

It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

This estimate and Lemma 10.4 imply that φ(f)Ψ is strongly continuous in
f in the topology of S (R1+d

Lemma 10.6 (Invariant subspace and essential self-adjointness).
(i) For all f ∈S (R1+d

k)).
(ii) For all f ∈SR(R1+d

k)).
Proof. (i) This follows the fact that a(g)# (g ∈L2(Rd
k)) leaves Fb,0
(L2(Rd
k)) invariant.
(ii) Let ΦS(·) be the Segal ﬁeld operator on Fb(L2(Rd

f ∈SR(R1+d
x
), we have
φ(f) =
√
2πΦS(Ff/√ω)
(10.40)
on Fb,0(L2(Rd

Fb,0(L2(Rd

□
Lemma 10.7 (Field equation). For all f ∈S (R1+d
x
) and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

φ((□+ m2)f)Ψ = 0.
(10.41)
Proof. We have
(F1+d(□+ m2)f)(k) = (−k2
0 + k2 + m2) ˆf(k).
Using (10.38) and the fact that −ω(k)2 + k2 + m2 = 0, we obtain
F(□+ m2)f = 0. Hence, (10.41) holds.
□
In terms of the distribution kernel φ(x) of φ(f) (f ∈S (R1+d
x
)), (10.41)
is written as
(□+ m2)φ(x)Ψ = 0,
i.e., φ(x) obeys the free KG equation in the sense of operator-valued dis-
tribution. By this fact and Lemma 10.6, we call the operator-valued distri-
bution φ a free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld.
As is expected, the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld φ has Poincar´e
covariance.

The results obtained so far on the quantum ﬁeld φ show that the
quadruple (Fb(L2(Rd
k)), Ub, φ, Fb,0(L2(Rd
k))) satisﬁes (GW.1)–(GW.3) in
the G˚arding–Wightman axioms, with the vacuum being the Fock vacuum
Ω0. In separate sections as follows, we show that (GW.4) and (GW.5) in
the G˚arding–Wightman axioms also hold in the present model.
10.9
Cyclicity of the Fock Vacuum
For all n ∈N and fj ∈S (R1+d
x
), j = 1, . . . , n, the Fock vacuum Ω0 ∈Fb
(L2(Rd
k)) is in D(φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)). Hence, the subspace
Dfree := span {Ω0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ω0|n ∈N, fj ∈S (R1+d
x
), j = 1, . . . , n}
is deﬁned. Obviously, for all f ∈S (R1+d
x
), φ(f) leaves Dfree invariant. One
has the following fact.
Theorem 10.11 (Cyclicity). The
subspace
Dfree
is
dense
in
Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
To prove this theorem, we need a lemma. Let
DKG := {Ff/√ω|f ∈S (R1+d)}
and
DKG,0 := span
v(ω)u

k. For all v ∈C∞
0 (R) and u ∈C∞
0 (Rd
k), ˆv × ˇu ∈S (R1+d) and
F ˆv × ˇu = v(ω)u. Hence,
DKG,0 ⊂DKG.
(10.42)
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
705
Lemma 10.9. The subspace DKG,0 is dense in L2(Rd
k).
Proof. Let g ∈D⊥
KG,0. Then, for any v ∈C∞
0 (R) and u ∈C∞
0 (Rd
k),

Rd G(k)u(k)dk = 0,
where G(k) := g(k)∗v(ω(k)/

ω(k). Since supp G is bounded, it follows
from the Schwarz inequality that G is locally integrable (i.e., G ∈L1
loc
(Rd
k)), where, in the case of m = 0, we use the condition d ≥2. Hence, by
the lemma of du Bois–Raymond (the fundamental lemma of the calculus
of variations), G = 0. Since v ∈C∞
0 (R) is arbitrary, it follows that g = 0.
Therefore, D⊥
KG,0 = {0}. Thus, DKG,0 is dense in L2(Rd
k).
□
From this lemma and (10.42), the following fact is derived.
Lemma 10.10. The subspace DKG is dense in L2(Rd
k).
We are now ready to prove Theorem 10.11.
Proof of Theorem 10.11
A function f ∈S (R1+d) is written as f = f1 + if2, where f1 (resp., f2)
is the real (resp., imaginary) part of f. Hence, φ(f) = φ(f1) + iφ(f2) on
D(N 1/2
b
). Therefore,
Dfree = span {Ω0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ω0|n ∈N, fj ∈SR(R1+d
x
), j = 1, . . . , n}.
By this fact and (10.40), we have
Dfree = span {Ω0, ΦS(F1) · · · ΦS(Fn)Ω0|n ∈N, Fj ∈DKG, j = 1, . . . , n}.
By Lemma 10.10, DKG is dense in L2(Rd
k). Hence, by Proposition 5.18 (iii),
Dfree is dense in Fb(L2(Rd
k)).
□
Theorem 10.11 shows that (GW.5) holds in the present model.

Commutation Relations and Microscopic Causality
In this section, we prove that, in the case of the 4-dimensional space-time
(d = 3), the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld φ satisﬁes the microscopic
causality (GW.4) in the G˚arding–Wightman axioms. In this way, it is shown
that the present model with d = 3 satisﬁes all of the G˚arding–Wightman
axioms. In fact, this holds in any dimensional space-time (d ≥2 in the
massless case m = 0). We will touch on this point in the following section.

10.10.1
Commutation relations
Let f, g ∈S (R1+d
x
). Then, by (10.35) and the CCR of a(·)#, we have the
following commutation relation on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)):
[φ(f), φ(g)] = i[D+(f, g) −D+(g, f)],

(10.44)
By cutting oﬀthe integral region of the integral on the right-hand side
of (10.44) and using Fubini’s theorem, we have
D+(f, g) = −iπ lim
κ→∞

For a function f ∈S (R1+d), Δ+,κ(f) is deﬁned by

R1+d Δ+,κ(x)f(x)dx.
Introducing the function
Δκ(x) := Δ+,κ(x) −Δ+,κ(−x), x ∈R1+d,
(10.45)
we have
[φ(f), φ(g)] = i lim

R1+d×R1+d f(x)Δκ(x −y)g(y)dxdy

By Lemma 10.4, the mapping S (R1+d

) ∋(f, g) →D+(f, g)
is separately continuous. Hence, according to the Schwartz nuclear theorem
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
707
(Theorem D.5 in Appendix D), there exists a unique tempered distribution
D+ ∈S ′(R2(1+d)) such that
D+(f × g) = D+(f, g),
f, g ∈S (R1+d
x
),
where (f × g)(x, y) := f(x)g(y), x, y ∈R1+d. We denote by D+(x, y) the
distribution kernel of D+:
D+(G) =

R1+d×R1+d
D+(x, y)G(x, y)dxdy,
G ∈S (R2(1+d)).
Lemma
10.11. The
tempered
distribution
D+
is
R1+d-translation
invariant, i.e., for all a ∈R1+d, D+(x + a, y + a) = D+(x, y) in the sense
of distribution.
Proof. Let f, g ∈S (R1+d
x
) and fa(x) := f(x −a), x ∈R1+d. Then, it
is easy to see that D+(fa, ga) = D+(f, g). Hence, D+(U1+d(a)(f × g)) =
D+(f × g), where
(U1+d(a)G)(x, y) := G(x −a, y −a),
x, y ∈R1+d.
Hence, by Corollary D.1, D+(U1+d(a)G) = D+(G) for all G ∈S (R2(1+d)),
This implies the desired result.
□
By Lemma 10.11 and Theorem D.3, there exists a unique tempered
distribution Δ+ ∈S ′(R1+d) such that
D+(x, y) = Δ+(x −y)
(10.46)
in the sense of distribution, i.e., for all G ∈S (R2(1+d)),
D+(G) = Δ+(I(G)),
where I(G)(x) :=
	
Rd G(x + y, y)dy, x ∈R1+d. In particular, for all f, g ∈
S (R1+d),
D+(f, g) = (Δ+ ∗g)(f),
where ∗denotes convolution (see Section D.9.2 in Appendix D).
By Theorem D.7(i) in Appendix D, Δ+ ∗g
is a polynomially
bounded C∞-function on R1+d satisfying (Δ+ ∗g)(x) = Δ+(˜gx), where
708
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
˜gx(y) := g(x −y), x, y ∈R1+d. Hence, it follows that
D+(f, g) =

R1+d Δ+(˜gx)f(x)dx.
Comparing this with (10.44), we obtain
Δ+(˜gx) = −
iπ
(2π)(1+d)/2

Rd
e−itω(k)+ik·x
ω(k)
ˆg(−ω(k), k)dk.
In particular, letting x = 0 and using the surjectivity of the mapping
S (R1+d) ∋g →˜g0 ∈S (R1+d), we obtain
Δ+(f) = −
iπ
(2π)(1+d)/2

(10.47)
Hence, in particular,
Δ+(f) = lim
κ→∞Δ+,κ(f),
f ∈S (R1+d),
(10.48)
i.e., Δ+,κ
S ′
→Δ+ (κ →∞).
We deﬁne a tempered distribution Δ ∈S ′(R1+d) by
Δ(f) := Δ+(f) −Δ+( ˜f),
f ∈S (R1+d),
where ˜f(x) := f(−x), x ∈R1+d. In terms of distribution kernels,
Δ(x) = Δ+(x) −Δ+(−x).
(10.49)
The tempered distribution Δ is called the Pauli–Jordan distribution.
In terms of this distribution, (10.43) takes the form
[φ(f), φ(g)] = i(Δ ∗g)(f),
f, g ∈S (R1+d),
(10.50)
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
For a function f on R1+d, the function fs on R1+d deﬁned by
(fs)(t, x) := f(t, −x),
t ∈R, x ∈Rd
is called the space-inversion of f.
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
709
A tempered distribution Ψ ∈S ′(R1+d) is said to be space-inversion
invariant if Ψ(fs) = Ψ(f) for all f ∈S (R1+d). In terms of the distribution
kernel Ψ(t, x), the space-inversion invariance of Ψ is written as Ψ(t, x) =
Ψ(t, −x).
Proposition 10.3. The distribution Δ+ obeys the KG equation:
Δ+((□+ m2)f) = 0,
f ∈S (R1+d).
(10.51)
Moreover, Δ+ is Lorentz and space-inversion invariant.
Proof. Let g = (□+ m2)f. Then,
ˆg(ω(k), k) = (−ω(k)2 + k2 + m2) ˆf(ω(k), k) = 0.
Hence, by (10.47), Δ+(g) = 0. Thus, (10.51) holds.
Let Λ ∈L ↑
+. Then, we have

f(0,Λ)(ω(k), −k) = ˆf(ω(kΛ), −kΛ),
f ∈S (R1+d), k ∈Rd.
Hence, by (10.47) and Lemma 10.2,
Δ+(f(0,Λ)) = Δ+(f).
Therefore, Δ+ is Lorentz invariant.
For all f ∈S (R1+d), we have
fs(ω(k), −k) = f(ω(k), k).
Hence, by (10.47), Δ+(fs) = Δ+(f).
□
The following corollary immediately follows from the deﬁnition of the
Pauli–Jordan distribution Δ and Proposition 10.3:
Corollary 10.2. The Pauli–Jordan distribution Δ obeys the KG equation:
Δ((□+ m2)f) = 0,
f ∈S (R1+d).
(10.52)
Moreover, Δ is Lorentz and space-inversion invariant.
10.10.2
The Pauli–Jordan distribution in the
four-dimensional space-time
The Pauli–Jordan distribution Δ can be computed in terms of special
distributions in any space-time dimension 1 + d (d ≥2 in the case of
m = 0). But, for simplicity and instructive reasons, we ﬁrst compute Δ

in the physical case of d = 3. For this purpose, we need only to com-
pute Δ+. By (10.48), the problem is reduced to an analysis of the limit
limκ→∞Δ+,κ(x) in S ′(R1+d).
Let d = 3. Then, using the polar coordinate of R3
k = {(k1, k2, k3)|kj ∈

k1 = k sin θ cos φ,
k2 = k sin θ sin φ,

k > 0, θ ∈[0, π), φ ∈[0, 2π), we have

4π|x|δ(|x| −t)
(10.54)
in the sense of distribution. Hence,
Δ+(−x) = −

Therefore,

(2) The case t < −r
In this case, −t/ρ > 1. Hence, there exists a unique number α > 0 such
that cosh α = −t/ρ. Then, sinh α = r/ρ. Hence, in the same manner as in

(3) The case t2 < r2
We set
η :=

r2 −t2.
We ﬁrst consider the case 0 < t < r. In this case, r/η > 1. Hence, there
exists a number α > 0 such that cosh α = r/η. Then, sinh α = t/η. Hence,
Vκ(t, r) =

(κ →∞),
where we have used a formula for K0(x) (x > 0) (see, for example, Moriguti
et al., 1960, p. 188). Hence, the third equation in (10.57) is obtained. Sim-
ilarly, one can derive the same result in the case 0 < −t < r.
□
Lemma 10.14. There exist positive constants C1 and C2 such that, for all
suﬃciently large κ > 0,
|Vκ(t, r)| ≤C1 +

|t2 −r2|
,
(t, r) ∈R × [0, ∞), |t| ̸= r.
Proof. We give a proof only in the case of t > r. The other cases on (t, r)
can be treated similarly. We have (10.58). We take κ so that R −α > 1.
Then, we have
Vκ(t, r) = 2

Sharp-Time Distributions and Feynman Propagator
As is easily seen, the function Δ+,κ is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable on R1+d, with
all the partial derivatives being bounded on R1+d. Hence, in particular, for
716
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
each t ∈R, Δ+,κ(t, ·) can be regarded as a tempered distribution on Rd
(see Section D.3.2 in Appendix D). Its form smeared with u ∈S (Rd) is
written Δ+,κ(t, u):
Δ+,κ(t, u) :=
1
2(2π)d/2i

|k|≤κ
e−iω(k)tˇu(k)
ω(k)
dk,
where ˇu denotes the inverse Fourier transform of u.
It is easy to see that the mapping Δ+(t, ·) : S (Rd) →C deﬁned by
Δ+(t, u) :=
1
2(2π)d/2i

Rd
e−iω(k)tˇu(k)
ω(k)
dk, u ∈S (Rd),
is a tempered distribution on Rd. Since |ˇu|/ω is integrable on Rd (recall
that, in the case of m = 0, d ≥2 is assumed), it follows that
lim
κ→∞Δ+,κ(t, u) = Δ+(t, u),
t ∈R, u ∈S (Rd).
For all v ∈S (R) and u ∈S (Rd), one has
Δ+(v × u) =

R
v(t)Δ+(t, u)dt.
Hence, Δ+(t, ·) is the sharp-time version of Δ+.
For each t ∈R, we deﬁne a tempered distribution ΔF(t, ·) on Rd by
ΔF(t, u) := θ(t)Δ+(t, u) + θ(−t)Δ+(−t, ˜u),
where θ(·) is the Heaviside function (see Example D.4 in Appendix D) and
˜u(x) := u(−x), x ∈Rd. It is easy to see that the mapping

ΔF(v × u) =

R
v(t)ΔF(t, u)dt,
v ∈S (R), u ∈S (Rd).
(10.63)
The distribution ΔF is called the Feynman propagator for the free
quantum KG ﬁeld. In terms of distribution kernels, we have
ΔF(x) = θ(x0)Δ+(x) + θ(−x0)Δ+(−x).
(10.64)
Using the fact that
Δ+(x)∗= −Δ+(−x)
in the distribution sense and the identity
θ(x0) + θ(−x0) = 1,
x0 ∈R \ {0},
we obtain
Δ+(x) = θ(x0)ΔF(x) −θ(−x0)ΔF(x)∗.
(10.65)
This is a formula representing Δ+ in terms of ΔF.
We outline how to ﬁnd an explicit form of ΔF. Using the residue theo-
rem, one can prove the following formula:

1/(k2 −m2 + i0) is the tempered distribution on R1+d deﬁned by (D.16) in
Appendix D.
718
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
This means that ΔF is the inverse Fourier transform of (2π)−(1+d)/2
(k2 −m2 + i0)−1:
ΔF =
1
(2π)(1+d)/2 F −1
1+d(k2 −m2 + i0)−1.

(□+ m2)ΔF(x −y) = −δ(x −y),
(10.68)
in the sense of distribution, i.e., −ΔF is a fundamental solution for the free
KG equation.
Formula (10.67) shows also that ΔF is a Lorentz invariant distribution.
The (inverse) Fourier transform of the tempered distributions of the
form (P(k) ± i0)−1 (P(k) is a quadratic form of k) is known (e.g., Gel’fand
and Shilov, 1964, Chapter 3, Section 2.8). Here, we only cite a result (apply

the distribution kernel ΔF(x) (resp., Δ+(x)), with a function in the region
x2 ̸= 0. However, as a distribution, ΔF has a singularity on the set x2 = 0,
which is represented as a linear combination of δ(x2) and its derivatives.
A similar remark applies to Δ+ too (see, for example, Gel’fand and Shilov,
1964, Chapter 3, Section 2.2).
Formula (10.70) gives the following representation for Δ(x) on the set

In particular, we have

Hence, the support of Δ is outside of the space-like region:
supp Δ ⊂{x ∈M1+d|x2 ≥0}.
By this fact and (10.50), we obtain the following result.
Theorem 10.14 (Microscopic causality). Let f, g ∈S (R1+d) be such
that supp f is space-like separated from supp g. Then,
[φ(f), φ(g)] = 0
on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
The results obtained so far are summarized as follows.
Theorem 10.15. The quintuple (Fb(L2(Rd
k)), Ub, φ, Dfree, Ω0) is a neutral
quantum scalar ﬁeld theory on M1+d in the sense of the G˚arding–Wightman
axioms. The vacuum in the theory is given by the Fock vacuum Ω0.
720
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
10.13
Vacuum Expectation Values
Since we have shown that (Fb(L2(Rd
k), Ub, φ, Dfree, Ω0) satisﬁes the
G˚ading–Wightman axioms, we can apply the results from the general theory
of QFT in Chapter 8. In particular, for each n ∈N, there exists a unique
tempered distribution W free
n
∈S ′(R(1+d)n) such that
W free
n
(f1 × · · · × fn)
= ⟨Ω0, φ(f1) · · · φ(fn)Ω0⟩, fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , n.
The tempered distribution W free
n
is called the n-point Wightman distri-
bution for the neutral free quantum KG ﬁeld.
It is easy to see that
W free
2
(f1, f2) = iD+(f1, f2).
Hence, it follows from (10.40) and Theorem 5.34 that, for all n ∈N and
fj ∈SR(R1+d) (j = 1, 2, . . .),
W free
2n−1(f1 × · · · × f2n−1) = 0,
(10.71)
W free
2n (f1 × · · · × f2n) = in 
comb
D+(fi1, fj1) · · · D+(fin, fjn).
(10.72)
By the linearity of Wn(f1 × · · · × fn) in each fj, (10.71) and (10.13) can be
extended to all fj ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, 2, . . .. In terms of distribution kernels,
(10.71) and (10.13) are written as follows:
W free
2n−1(x1, . . . , x2n−1) = 0,
(10.73)
W free
2n (x1, . . . , x2n) = in 

(10.74)
In particular,

(10.75)
The time-ordered two-point vacuum expectation value is deﬁned
by
G2(x, y) := θ(x0 −y0)W free
2
(x, y) + θ(y0 −x0)W free
2
(y, x)
in the sense of distribution. In the physics literature, G2 is called the causal
Green function, although it is not a function globally. It follows from
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
721
(10.75) and (10.64) that
G2(x, y) = iΔF(x −y).
(10.76)
This gives a physical meaning of Feynman’s propagator ΔF.
10.14
Quantum Field with Momentum Cutoﬀ
For each x ∈Rd and a constant κ > 0, we deﬁne a function gκ,x on Rd
k by
gκ,x(k) := e−ik·xχκ(k)

(2π)dω(k)
,
k ∈Rd
k,
where
χκ(k) :=

1
for |k| ≤κ
0
for |k| > κ
.
(10.77)
It is easy to see that gκ,xe±iωt/√ω is in L2(Rd
k). Hence, we can deﬁne a
self-adjoint operator
φκ(t, x) := ΦS(gκ,xeiωt) =
1
√
2

a (gκ,xeiωt)∗+ a (gκ,xeiωt)

.
(10.78)
The correspondence (t, x) →φκ(t, x) gives an operator-valued function
on R1+d.
Proposition 10.4. For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), φκ(t, x)Ψ is inﬁnitely strongly
diﬀerentiable in t, x and satisﬁes the free KG equation:
(□+ m2)φκ(t, x)Ψ = 0.
(10.79)
Proof. For each k ∈Rd,
(□+ m2)gκ,x(k)eiω(k)t = 0.
Using this property, one can prove (10.79) in the same way as we proved
Theorem 10.3.
□
The operator-valued function φκ(t, x) is called the free quantum KG
ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀκ.
This notion of quantum ﬁeld comes from the symbolical expression
(10.6) of the kernel φ(x) of the free quantum KG ﬁeld φ. Indeed, by
restricting the integral with respect to dk in (10.6) to the bounded set
722
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
{k ∈Rd| |k| ≤κ}, one obtains a well-deﬁned expression which is simply
the right-hand side of (10.78).
The momentum cutoﬀκ is also called an ultraviolet cutoﬀsince a
region of large |k| physically corresponds to an optical region of ultraviolet
rays.

Proposition 10.5. The quantum ﬁeld φκ(t, x) is translation and space-
rotation covariant, i.e., for all a ∈R1+d and R ∈SO(d),
Ub(a, ˆR)φκ(x)Ub(a, ˆR)−1 = φκ( ˆRx + a),
x = (t, x) ∈R1+d.
Proof. For all k ∈Rd,

We have R−1k = k ˆ
R. Therefore, |k ˆ
R| = |k|. Using these properties, we
obtain
u(a, ˆR)gκ,xeiωt = gκ,Rx+aeiω(t+a0), a = (a0, a).
Hence, the desired result follows.

where Id−2 is the (d −2) × (d −2) unit matrix. Let (y0, y) := Λ(θ)x. Then,

,
(gκ,yeiωy0)(k) = ei˜kΛ(θ)xχκ(k)

.
Note that Λ(θ)−1 = Λ(−θ). Hence,
kΛ(θ) = (ω(k) sinh θ + k1 cosh θ, k2, . . . , kd),
Using this form, one can show that there exists a θ > 0 such that χκ ̸= χκ,θ
where χκ,θ(k) := χκ(kΛ(θ)), k ∈Rd. Hence,
u(0, Λ(θ))gκ,xeiωt ̸= gκ,yeiωy0.
Thus, Ub(0, Λ(θ))φκ(x)Ub(0, Λ(θ))−1 ̸= φκ(Λ(θ)x).

Hence, the L2(Rd
k)-valued Bochner (strong) integral6
Iκ(f) :=

Rd f(x)gκ,xdx
exists. It is easy to see that the L2(Rd
k)-valued function x →gκ,x is strongly
continuous on Rd
x. Hence, if f ∈L1(Rd) ∩C(Rd), then Iκ(f) is also the
strong Riemann integral of f(x)gκ,x, Section E.1.

domain D(N 1/2

As in the case of Iκ(f), if f ∈L1(Rd) ∩C1(Rd), then Aκ,±(t, f)Ψ are also
taken in the sense of the strong Riemann integral because the mapping
L2(Rd
k) ∋u →a(u)#Ψ is strongly continuous.
It is easy to see that, for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
b
), the Bochner integral8
φκ(t, f)Ψ :=

Rd φκ(t, x)f(x)Ψ dx
exists and

Theorem 10.16. Let f ∈L1(Rd) ∩C1(Rd) such that ˆf/√ω ∈L2(Rd

Then, for all t ∈R and Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

),
lim
κ→∞∥φκ(t, f)Ψ −φ(t, f)Ψ∥= 0,
where φ(t, ·) is the sharp-time free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld.
Proof. By the strong continuity of the mapping L2(Rd
k) ∋u →a(u)#Ψ,
we have
Aκ,+(t, f)Ψ = a(Iκ(f)eiωt)∗Ψ,
Aκ,−(t, f)Ψ = a(Iκ(f ∗)eiωt)Ψ.
Hence,

Therefore,

By Lemma 10.16, the right-hand side converges to 0 as κ →∞.
□
Theorem 10.16 shows that the sharp-time-smeared free KG ﬁeld φκ(t, f)
with momentum cutoﬀκ strongly converges to the sharp-time free KG ﬁeld
φ(t, f) on D(N 1/2
b
) in the limit κ →∞of removing the momentum cutoﬀκ.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In this sense, φκ(t, f) gives an approximate form of φ(t, f). But φκ(t, x)
itself does not converge as the following example shows.
Example 10.2. It is easy to see that
∥φκ(t, x)Ω0∥2 =
1
2(2π)d

|k|≤κ
1
ω(k)dk.
Since
	
Rd ω(k)−1dk = ∞, we have
lim
κ→∞∥φκ(t, x)Ω0∥2 = ∞.
This implies that limκ→∞φκ(t, x)Ω0 does not exist.
Remark 10.6. The divergence seen in the above example is an elementary
example of the so-called ultraviolet divergences in QFT. This kind of
divergence comes from treating a mathematically meaningless object, such
as φ(x)n (n ≥2), which is used to “deﬁne” an interaction of a quantum ﬁeld
at the space-time point x. The problem of ultraviolet divergences in QFT is
not yet solved mathematically with full generality, although algorithms to
obtain ﬁnite results in QFT models in terms of formal perturbation theory
have been established as “renormalization theory.” To construct in a non-
perturbative way a non-trivial model of relativistic QFT without ultraviolet
cutoﬀs in the four-dimensional Minkowski space-time is still one of the most
important challenges in modern mathematical physics.
10.15
Schwinger Functions
Since we have seen that the free neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld theory
(Fb(L2(Rd
k), Ub, φ, Dfree, Ω0) satisﬁes the G˚arding–Wightman axioms, it
follows from the general theory given in Chapter 8 that it also satisﬁes
the Wightman axioms and the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms. It may be
interesting to compute explicitly the Schwinger functions of the model.
By (10.73) and (10.13), it is suﬃcient to compute the two-point
Schwinger function. Taking (10.75) into account, we deﬁne a function
W(z, x) (z ∈C \ R, k ∈Rd) as follows:
W(z, x) :=

Lemma 10.17. For each x ∈Rd, W(z, x) is analytic in z on C \ R and
lim
ε↓0 W(t + iε, x) = iΔ+(t, x),
(10.81)
lim
ε↓0 W(t −iε, x) = iΔ+(−t, x)
(10.82)
in S ′(R1+d).
Proof. Let Im z > 0. Then, W(z, x) =
	
Rd fx(z, k)dk with fx(z, k) :=
eiω(k)z−ik·x/2(2π)dω(k). It is obvious that fx(z, k) is diﬀerentiable in z
and, for all z ∈C satisfying Im z ≥δ > 0, where δ > 0 is an arbitrary
constant,

2(2π)d e−ω(k)δ
and 	
Rd e−ω(k)δdk
<

integration, W(z, x) is diﬀerentiable in z on the region {z ∈C|Im z > δ}
and
∂W(z, x)

Rd eiω(k)z−ik·xdk.
Since δ > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that W(z, x) is analytic in z on {z ∈
C|Im z > 0}. Similarly, one can show the analyticity of W(z, x) in z on
{z ∈C|Im z < 0}.
Let f ∈S (R1+d) and ε > 0. Then,

R1+d W(t + iε, x)f(t, x)dtdx =
π
(2π)(1+d)/2

Rk
ˆf(ω(k), k)

Hence, according to the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we have

Thus, (10.81) holds. Similarly, (10.82) is proved.

The reader is asked to prove this formula (Problem 10).
Lemma 10.17 shows that W(z1 −z2, x1 −x2) is an analytic continu-
ation of the two-point Wightman distribution W free
2
(x1, x2) to the region
{((z1, x1), (z2, x2)) ∈C1+d × C1+d|Im (z1 −z2) > 0, x1, x2 ∈Rd} and
W(z2−z1, x2−x1) is an analytic continuation of W free
2
(x1, x2) to the region
{((z1, x1), (z2, x2)) ∈C1+d × C1+d|Im (z1 −z2) < 0, x1, x2 ∈Rd} (recall
that Δ+ is space-inversion invariant). Hence, the two-point Schwinger func-
tion Sfree

(x, y) (x, y ∈R1+d, x ̸= y) of the present model is given as follows:

(x, y) =

Let

and
S(x) := W(ix0, x),
x ∈R1+d
̸=

(10.84)
Then, we have
Sfree
2
(x, y) = θ(x0 −y0)S(x −y) + θ(y0 −x0)S(y −x).
It follows from the deﬁnition of W2(z, x) that, for all x ∈R1+d

S(x) =

10.16
Charged Quantum Scalar Field
In this section, we describe an outline of a method to construct a quantum
ﬁeld version of a complex scalar ﬁeld (a classical ﬁeld with values in C) φcl
satisfying the free KG equation (10.1). For the basic aspects of a complex
scalar ﬁeld theory, see Problem 14 (this may be helpful to understand the
method described as follows).
10.16.1
Heuristic arguments
A general form of a complex scalar ﬁeld φcl(x) satisfying (10.1) is given by
φcl(x) =

Rd dk
1

2(2π)dω(k)

acl
−(k)
∗eiω(k)t−ik·x + acl
+(k)e−iω(k)t+ik·x
,
(10.86)
where acl
± are functions with suitable properties. Note that, in contrast to
the case of the real scalar ﬁeld, two independent functions, acl
±, appear here.
To obtain a quantum version of the complex ﬁeld φcl, one needs only to
replace the functions acl
± by the operator-valued distributions a±(k) satis-
fying the CCR
[a±(k), a±(k′)∗] = δ(k −k′),
[a±(k), a±(k′)] = 0,
[a+(k), a−(k′)∗] = 0,
[a+(k), a−(k′)] = 0.
Hence, two kinds of annihilation operators, a±(k), are needed. Therefore, a
quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical ﬁeld φcl is supposed to describe
two kinds of elementary particles. It turns out that these two kinds of ele-
mentary particles are interpreted as charged particles which have the same
mass but diﬀerent signs of charge.9 As is well known, to each elementary

Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
731
particle, there corresponds an elementary particle, called its anti-particle,
which has the same mass, the same spin and the same life time but a dif-
ferent sign as for electromagnetic properties. Therefore, the quantum ﬁeld
corresponding to the complex classical ﬁeld φcl is interpreted to describe a
charged particle and its anti-particle with spin 0.
Let H+ be a Hilbert space of state vectors of a charged particle with
spin 0 and H−be that of its anti-particle. From a quantum ﬁeld theoretical
point of view, a particle and its anti-particle are not separated but two
appearances of one entity. This one entity is nothing but a pair of a particle
and an anti-particle. Hence, it is natural to take the direct sum Hilbert space
H1 = H+ ⊕H−
as a one-particle Hilbert space of the quantum ﬁeld to be constructed. Then,
it is expected that the theory of the boson Fock space Fb(H1) over H1 can
be used to construct the desired quantum ﬁeld theory.
10.16.2
Outline of a mathematically rigorous construction
Based on the heuristic arguments in the preceding section, we now give an
outline of a mathematically rigorous construction of a charged quantum
scalar ﬁeld.
(1) Creation and annihilation operators
The choice of the Hilbert spaces H+ and H−may be arbitrary in an
abstract level. However, to be parallel to the theory of the free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld, we take H± = L2(Rd
k) so that
H1 = L2(Rd
k) ⊕L2(Rd
k) = {(f, g)|f, g ∈L2(Rd
k)}.
We denote by a(f, g) the annihilation operator on the boson Fock space
Fb(H1) with test vector (f, g) ∈H1. This operator yields two operators:
a+(f) := a(f, 0),
a−(f) := a(0, f),
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
We call a+(f) (resp., a−(f)) the annihilation operator of the particle
(resp., anti-particle) with test vector f. The adjoint a+(f)∗(resp.,
a−(f)∗) is called the creation
operator
of
the
particle (resp.,
anti-particle) with test vector f. As is easily seen, the following
732
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
commutation relations hold on Fb,0(H1): for all f, g ∈L2(Rd
k),
[a±(f), a±(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩,
[a±(f), a±(g)] = 0,
(10.87)
[a+(f), a−(g)] = 0,
, [a+(f), a−(g)∗] = 0.
(10.88)
We denote by Nb the number operator on Hb(H1).
(2) A free charged quantum scalar ﬁeld
The heuristic arguments in the preceding section suggest one to deﬁne a
quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical ﬁeld φcl by
φcp(f) := √π

a−
 Ff
√ω

+ a+
Ff ∗
√ω

, f ∈S (R1+d),
where the subscript “cp” means “charged particle.” In the same way as in
the case of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld, one can show that
φcp((□+ m2)f) = 0
on D(N 1/2
b
), i.e., φcp satisﬁes the free KG equation in the sense of operator-
valued distribution. We call φcp a free charged quantum scalar ﬁeld.
Commutation relations (10.87) and (10.88) imply the following com-
mutation relations of the free charged quantum scalar ﬁeld: for all f, g ∈
S (R1+d),
[φcp(f), φcp(g)∗] = i

R1+d f(x)(Δ ∗g∗)(x)dx,
[φcp(f), φcp(g)] = 0,
[φcp(f)∗, φcp(g)∗] = 0
on Fb,0(H1). In particular, if supp f is space-like separated from supp g,
then [φcp(f), φcp(g)∗] = 0 on Fb,0(H1). This is the microscopic causality
in the present model.
(3) Sharp-time quantum ﬁelds
The sharp-time quantum ﬁeld of φcp(f) is deﬁned by
φcp(t, f) :=

In the classical ﬁeld theory, the canonical conjugate momentum ﬁeld πcl is
given by ˙φ∗
cl. Taking this fact into account, we deﬁne the canonical conjugate
momentum operator πcp(t, f) by
πcp(t, f) :=

Note that
d
dtφcp(t, f)∗Ψ = π(t, f ∗)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(H1),
where d/dt means strong diﬀerentiation in t. It is easy to see that φcp(t, f)
and πcp(t, f) satisfy the Heisenberg CCR over S (Rd): for all f, g ∈S (Rd)
and t ∈R,
[φcp(t, f), πcp(t, g)] = i

Rd f(x)g(x)dx,
[φcp(t, f), φcp(t, g)] = 0,
[πcp(t, f), πcp(t, g)] = 0
on Fb,0(H1).
(4) The Hamiltonian and the momentum operator
The Hamiltonian of the present model is deﬁned by
Hcp := dΓb(ω ⊕ω),
i.e., the second quantization of the direct sum operator ω ⊕ω on H1. It is
easy to see that, for all t ∈R and f ∈S (Rd),
eitHcpφcp(0, f)e−itHcp = φcp(t, f),
eitHcpπcp(0, f)e−itHcp = πcp(t, f).
The momentum operator (Pcp,1, . . . , Pcp,d) is deﬁned by

j = 1, . . . , d,
where pj denotes the multiplication operator by the variable kj on L2(Rd

(5) The total charge operator
In the theory of a charged quantum ﬁeld, a new object, called a charge
operator, appears.10 Let q ∈R \ {0} be the charge of the quantum particle
10For the classical counterpart, see Problem 14.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
under consideration. Then, the operator qI ⊕(−qI) on H1 satisﬁes
qI ⊕(−qI)(f, 0) = q(f, 0),
f ∈H+,
qI ⊕(−qI)(0, g) = −q(0, g),
g ∈H−.
Hence, H+ is the eigenspace of qI ⊕(−qI) with eigenvalue +q and H−is
the eigenspace of qI ⊕(−qI) with eigenvalue −q (the charge of the anti-
particle). For this reason, qI ⊕(−qI) is called the charge operator on
the one-particle space H1.
The second quantization
Q := dΓb(qI ⊕(−qI)) = q dΓb(I ⊕(−I))
of the charge operator qI ⊕(−qI) is called the total charge operator on
Fb(H1). We have
QΩH1 = 0,
where ΩH1 = {1, 0, 0, . . .} is the Fock vacuum in Fb(H1).
It is easy to see that
Q = qdΓb(I ⊕0) −qdΓb(0 ⊕I).
on Fb,0(H1). Hence, by Theorem 5.18, the following commutation relations
hold on Fb,0(H1):
[Q, a+(f)∗] = qa+(f)∗,
[Q, a−(f)∗] = −qa−(f)∗,
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
Therefore, for all vectors of the form
Ψn+,n−:= a+(f1)∗· · · a+(fn+)∗a−(g1)∗· · · a−(gn−)∗ΩH1
(n± ∈Z+, fj ∈H+, gi ∈H−), which represents a state vector consisting
of n+ particles and n−anti-particles, we have
QΨn+,n−= (n+ −n−)qΨn+,n−.
Note that (n+ −n−)q is the total charge of the state Ψn+,n−.
Let
N+ := dΓb(I ⊕0),
N−:= dΓb(0 ⊕I).
Then,
Nb = N+ + N−.
(6) Unitary representation of the proper Poincar´e group
We already know that there is a natural strongly continuous uni-
tary representation of the proper Poincar´e group P↑
+ on L2(Rd
k), i.e.,
Relativistic Free Quantum Scalar Fields
735
{u(a, Λ)|(a, Λ) ∈P↑
+} deﬁned by (10.32). The direct sum u(a, Λ) ⊕u(a, Λ)
gives a representation of P↑
+ on H1. From this representation, one can
construct a strongly continuous unitary representation {Ucp(a, Λ)|(a, Λ) ∈
P↑
+} of P↑
+ on Fb(H1) by
Ucp(a, Λ) := Γb(u(a, Λ) ⊕u(a, Λ)).
This representation has the following properties:
(i) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+,
Ucp(a, Λ)ΩH1 = ΩH1.
(ii) For all a ∈R1+d,
Ucp(a, I) = eia0Hcpeia1Pcp,1 · · · eiadPcp,d.
(iii) For all (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and f ∈S (R1+d),
Ucp(a, Λ)φcp(f)Ucp(a, Λ)−1 = φcp(f(a,Λ))
on Fb,0(H1).
(7) Vacuum expectation values
Using (10.87), (10.88) and the fact that a±(f)ΩH1 = 0 (f ∈L2(Rd
k)), one
can show that, for all f, g ∈S (R1+d),
W2(f, g) := ⟨ΩH1, φcp(f)φcp(g)∗ΩH1⟩
= π

10.16.3
Unitary equivalence to the system of two neutral
quantum scalar ﬁelds
The classical charged ﬁeld φcl(x) given by (10.86) is written in terms of two
real ﬁelds φ1 and φ2 as follows:
φcl(x) =
1
√
2(φcl,1(x) + iφcl,2(x)),
with
φcl,1(x) := φcl(x) + φcl(x)∗
√

,
φcl,2(x) := φcl(x) −φcl(x)∗
√
2 i
.
We want to show that a similar structure exists in the quantum ﬁeld φcp
too. For this purpose, we note that φcl
1 and φcl
2 are rewritten as follows:
φcl,1(x) =

This suggests that, in the quantum ﬁeld version, the annihilation operators
a1(·) and a2(·) of the two neutral quantum scalar ﬁelds are unitarily
equivalent to (a+(·) + a−(·))/
√
2 and (a+(·) −a−(·))/
√
2 i, respectively.
Indeed, this is true, as shown in the following.
Let Fj = Fb(Rd
k) (j = 1, 2) be the boson Fock space for a free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld φj(·), where φj(·) is a copy of the free neutral KG ﬁeld
φ(·) deﬁned by (10.35). We denote the annihilation operator on Fj(L2(Rd
k))
by aj(·), as suggested above. The Hilbert space of the composite system of
the two free neutral KG ﬁelds is given by
F := F1 ⊗F2.
By Theorem 5.40, there exists a unitary operator V
: F →Fb(H1)
such that
V Ω0 ⊗Ω0 = ΩH1
and
V (a1(f) ⊗I)V −1 = a+(f),
V (I ⊗a2(f))V −1 = a−(f).
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
We next deﬁne a linear operator T on H1 by
T (f, g) =
f + ig
√
2 , f −ig
√
2

,
(f, g) ∈H1.
It is easy to see that T is unitary. Hence, Γb(T ) is unitary on Fb(H1). By
Theorem 5.32, we have
Γb(T )a+(f, 0)Γb(T )−1 = a(T (f, 0)) =
1
√
2a(f, f) = a+(f) + a−(f)
√
2
.
and
Γb(T )a−(f, 0)Γb(T )−1 = a(T (0, f)) =
1
√
2
a(if, −if) = a+(f) −a−(f)
√
2 i
on Fb,0(H1). Therefore, the operator
UT := Γb(T )V
is unitary from F to Fb(H1) and
UT a1(f) ⊗IU −1
T
= a+(f) + a−(f)
√

UT I ⊗a2(f)U −1

= a+(f) −a−(f)

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
on Fb,0(H1). Hence, for all f ∈S (R1+d), we obtain

√
2(φ1(f) ⊗I + iI ⊗φ2(f))U −1
T
= φcp(f)
on Fb,0(H1).
The unitary operator T has the matrix representation
T =
1
√
2

.
Hence, it follows that, for any linear operator A on L2(Rd
k),
T

A 0

T −1 =

as an operator on H1. Therefore, we have
UT (Hb ⊗I + I ⊗Hb)U −1
T
= Hcp
and
UT ( ˆPb,j ⊗I + I ⊗ˆPb,j)U −1
T
= Pcp,j,
j = 1, . . . , d.
Thus, we see that the theory of the charged quantum scalar ﬁeld φcp is
equivalent to that of the pair (φ1, φ2) of two quantum scalar ﬁelds. This
structure may be useful to construct models of interacting charged quantum
scalar ﬁelds.
10.16.4
PCT theorem
Finally, we brieﬂy look at the PCT symmetry in the free charged quantum
scalar ﬁeld. Let uC : H1 →H1 be deﬁned by
uC(f+, f−) = (f ∗
−, f ∗
+),
(f+, f−) ∈H1.
Then, it is easy to see that uC is anti-unitary. We call uC the charge
conjugation operator on H1. As is seen, uC exchanges a state of a
particle and a state of an anti-particle with complex conjugation.
Let I0 and Is be deﬁned by (8.75) and (8.76), respectively. For each
f ∈S (R1+d), we deﬁne ˜f ∈S (R1+d)) by
˜f(x) = f(−x) = f(IsI0x).

Finite Volume Approximations and Inﬁnite
Volume Limit
It is easily seen that, even in the case of the free quantum KG ﬁeld theories
studied in this chapter, the methods of the ﬁnite volume approximations
discussed in Section 9.9 are valid without essential changes; only the one-
particle Hamiltonian takes a diﬀerent form from that of the one-particle
Hamiltonian ENR (in the momentum representation) of the free quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld. In this section, we only give a result on the inﬁnite volume
limit of the Hamiltonian of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld in the ﬁnite
volume approximation.
Let ω be given by (10.2). Then, the Hamiltonian of the free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld in the ﬁnite volume approximation is given by
H(L)
b
:= dΓb(ωL).

x ∈R1+d,
where, for a function f, f # := f or f ∗. Show that φ#
ε is a solution

Remark. This result includes the space-inversion symmetry, the

(2) Let φcl be a real free classical KG ﬁeld on R1+d. According to the
Lagrangian formalism of classical ﬁeld theory, the Hamiltonian Hcl(x0)
(the total energy of the ﬁeld) is given by
Hcl(x0) :=

Rd(πcl(x) ˙φcl(x) −L (x))dx,
where L (x) is the Lagrangian density deﬁned by (10.4). In this prob-

necessary to justify mathematical manipulations.

Hcl =

▶Hint. Use the Plancherel theorem in Fourier analysis (see
(9.19)). For example,
	
Rd φcl(t, x)2dx =

that φcl is real-valued). One has
ˆφcl(t, x) =

Remark. By (iii), the quantum version of Hcl is inferred to be

Rd ω(k)a(k)∗a(k)dk = dΓb(ω)
in the sense of the sesquilinear form (see Proposition 9.7). This is the reason
why the free Hamiltonian of the quantum ﬁeld corresponding to the classical

Classical Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
11.1.1
The Maxwell equations and gauge invariance
As is well known, most macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena are
explained by the theory of electromagnetism established by Maxwell.
A basic object in this theory is the pair (E, B) of an electric ﬁeld E =
(E1, E2, E3) : M4 →R3 and a magnetic ﬁeld B = (B1, B2, B3) : M4 →R3
on the four-dimensional Minkowski space-time M4 = {x = (ct, x)|t ∈R,
x ∈R3} (where c is the speed of light in a vacuum), obeying the Maxwell
equations:
(M.1)
div E = ϱ
ε0
,
(M.2)
rot E = −∂tB,
(M.3)
div B = 0,
(M.4)
rot B =
j
c2ε0
+ 1
c2 ∂tE,
where div u := 3
j=1 ∂juj (the spatial divergence of u = (u1, u2, u3) :
M4 →R3), rot u := (∂2u3 −∂3u2, ∂3u1 −∂1u3, ∂1u2 −∂2u1) (the spatial
rotation of u), j = (j1, j2, j3) : M4 →R3 denotes a current density, ϱ :
M4 →R denotes a charge density and ε0 is the dielectric constant in the
vacuum. Here, we use the MKSA unit system.
Henceforth, we move to the unit system with c = 1. It follows from a
basic theorem in vector analysis (the Poincar´e lemma) that (M.3) implies
the existence of a vector ﬁeld A = (A1, A2, A3) : M4 →R3 such that
B = rot A.
(11.1)
747
748
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The vector ﬁeld A is called a vector potential. Substituting (11.1) for
(M.2), we have rot (E + ∂tA) = 0. Hence, there exists a scalar ﬁeld φ :
M4 →R such that E + ∂tA = −∇φ, i.e.,
E = −∂tA −∇φ,
(11.2)
where ∇:= (∂1, ∂2, ∂3). The scalar ﬁeld φ is called a scalar potential.
The pair
A := (φ, A)
is called an electromagnetic potential, or a gauge potential.1
We have from (11.2) and (M.1) that
−Δφ(x) −div ∂tA(x) = ϱ(x)
ε0
,
(11.3)
where Δ := div ∇= 3
j=1 ∂2
j (a three-dimensional Laplacian). On the
other hand, (11.1), (11.2), and (M.4) give
□A(x) + ∇(∂tφ(x) + div A(x)) = j(x)
ε0
,
(11.4)
where □:= ∂2
t −Δ (a four-dimensional d’Alembertian).
Conversely, for any vector ﬁeld A = (φ, A) : M4 →M4 satisfying (11.3)
and (11.4), the vector ﬁelds B and E deﬁned by (11.1) and (11.2) satisfy
the Maxwell equations (M.1)–(M.4).
Thus, the electromagnetic theory is essentially equivalent to the theory
on vector ﬁelds A obeying (11.3) and (11.4).
11.1.2
A diﬃculty in constructing a quantum
electromagnetic ﬁeld
In constructing a quantum version of the classical electromagnetic theory,
i.e., a quantum electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, one encounters some diﬃculty
in contrast to the case of a de Broglie ﬁeld or a scalar ﬁeld. One of the
reasons is that the components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B) are not
independent, being mutually related through the Maxwell equations, even
in the case of j = 0 and ϱ = 0 (where there exist no currents and no
charges). So, it may be natural to try to ﬁnd a quantum version (or a
“quantized” version) of the electromagnetic potential A rather than the
electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B). If this can be done, then one may automati-
cally obtain a quantum version of (E, B) through (11.1) and (11.2).
1In strict terms, A is the 1-form φdx0 + 3
j=1 Ajdxj.
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
749
As is seen from (11.3) and (11.4), the components of A are not indepen-
dent mutually. However, by making use of some invariance in the theory,
the dependence among the components of the electromagnetic potential A
can be expressed in a simple form, as shown in the following. This invari-
ance is associated with the non-uniqueness of electromagnetic potentials
which yield the same electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B). Indeed, it is easy to see
that, for any diﬀerentiable function Λ on M4, the electromagnetic potential
A′ = (φ′, A′) deﬁned by
A′ = A + ∇Λ,
φ′ = φ −∂tΛ
(11.5)
gives the same electromagnetic ﬁeld (E, B) as that derived from A and
obeys (11.3) and (11.4), with A replaced by A′.
The correspondence
GΛ : A →A′,
A′ := GΛ(A)
is called the gauge transformation associated with Λ. The function Λ,
which deﬁnes this transformation, is called a gauge function, or simply
a gauge. Thus, the electromagnetic theory is invariant under gauge trans-
formations. This property is called gauge invariance.
By a gauge transformation, the ﬁeld equations (11.3) and (11.4) may
be converted into simpler forms. Specifying a gauge is called gauge ﬁxing.
Here, we give two examples.
(A) Coulomb gauge
Let us ﬁnd a gauge function Λ0 such that A′ = GΛ0(A) and div A′ = 0.
This condition is equivalent to
ΔΛ0 = −div A.
(11.6)
Hence, for each t ∈R, Λ0(t, ·) should be a solution to a three-dimensional
Poisson equation. By Example D.15 in Appendix D,
Λ0(t, x) :=

R3
div A(t, y)
4π|x −y| dy,
(t, x) ∈M4
is a solution to (11.6) under a suitable condition for div A. Thus, for such a
vector potential A, we have div A′ = 0, i.e., A′ is divergence-free. Thus, we
have seen that, for a suitable class of vector potentials, it is always possible,
through a gauge transformation, to bring any element in the class to a vector
potential which is divergence-free. In the case where a vector potential is
750
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
divergence-free, one says that the Coulomb gauge, or radiation gauge,
is taken.
(B) Lorenz gauge
One can also consider an electromagnetic potential A satisfying the Lorenz
condition2
∂tφ + div A = 0
(see Problem 1). In this case, one says that the Lorenz gauge is taken. In
relativistic notation, this condition is written as
∂μ Aμ = 0,
where A = ( Aμ)3
μ=0 := (φ, −A1, −A2, −A3) (hence, Aj = Aj, j = 1, 2, 3).
Hence, the Lorenz condition is relativistically invariant.
11.2
Free Electromagnetic Potentials in the Coulomb Gauge
Let A be an electromagnetic potential in the Coulomb gauge:
div A = 0.
(11.7)
Then, (11.3) and (11.4) take the following forms:
−Δφ(x) = ϱ(x)
ε0
,
(11.8)
□A(x) + ∂t∇φ(x) = j(x)
ε0
.
(11.9)
Equation (11.8) shows that φ satisﬁes the three-dimensional Poisson
equation. Hence, under a suitable condition for φ and ϱ, we have
φ(t, x) =

R3
ϱ(t, y)
4πε0|x −y|dy.
Hence, the scalar potential φ is determined by the charge density ϱ.

with H. A. Lorentz (1853–1928), a Dutch physicist.
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
751
Now, as the simplest case, let us consider the case where charges and
currents do not exist in the space-time:
j = 0,
ϱ = 0.
An electromagnetic ﬁeld and an electromagnetic potential, in this case, are
called a free electromagnetic ﬁeld and a free electromagnetic poten-
tial, respectively. Then, a free electromagnetic potential in the Coulomb
gauge satisﬁes
div A = 0,
(11.10)
φ = 0,
(11.11)
□A(x) = 0.
(11.12)
Hence, each Aj obeys the free wave equation (the free KG equation with
mass zero). Therefore, as in the case of the free KG equation, a general
solution to (11.12) is given as follows:
Aj(t, x) =

R3 dk
1

2(2π)3|k|

aj(k)∗ei|k|t−ik·x + aj(k)e−i|k|t+ik·x

,
j = 1, 2, 3,
(11.13)
where aj(k) is a function on R3 such that

R3 |k|s|aj(k)|dk
<
∞,
s = −1/2, 3/2.
Remark 11.1. Equations (11.10)–(11.12) are not Lorentz invariant. This
may be a fault in using the Coulomb gauge. However, as suggested by
(11.13) and as shown in the following, a quantum version of Aj can be
constructed easier than in the case of other gauges. To maintain Lorentz
invariance, one can use, for example, the Lorenz gauge. But, in this case,
it becomes more diﬃcult to construct a quantum version of A since the
need for using an indeﬁnite metric Hilbert space occurs (see, for example,
Wightman and G˚arding, 1964 or Arai, 2016b for details).
The Fourier transformation of (11.10) takes the form
3
	
j=1
kj ˆAj(t, k) = 0
(k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3),
where

Since t ∈R is arbitrary, it follows that 3
j=1 kjaj(−k)∗= 0 and
3
	
j=1
kjaj(k) = 0,
k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3.
This means that, for each k ∈R3, the vector a(k) := (a1(k), a2(k), a3(k))
is orthogonal to k.
For each k ∈R3\{0}, there exists a unit vector e(1)(k) ∈R3 orthogonal
to k: k · e(1)(k) = 0. Then, the vector
e(2)(k) := k
|k| × e(1)(k)
is a unit vector satisfying
e(1)(k) × e(2)(k) = k
|k|,
e(1)(k) · e(2)(k) = 0,
where, for vectors u = (u1, u2, u3), v = (v1, v2, v3) ∈R3, u×v denotes their
exterior product:
u × v := (u2v3 −u3v2, u3v1 −u1v3, u1v2 −u2v1).
Hence, {k/|k|, e(1)(k), e(2)(k)} forms an orthonormal basis of R3.
Since a(k) is orthogonal to k, a(k) is expanded as
a(k) = a(1)
cl (k)e(1)(k) + a(2)
cl (k)e(2)(k),
with a(r)
cl (k) := a(k) · e(r)(k), r = 1, 2. Hence, for j = 1, 2, 3,
Aj(t, x) =

where e(r)(k) = (e(r)
1 (k), e(r)
2 (k), e(r)
3 (k)) (r = 1, 2).
Remark 11.2. The vector e(r)(k) physically denotes the polarization of
an electromagnetic wave with a wave number vector k. For this reason,
e(1)(k) and e(2)(k) are called polarization vectors with a wave number
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
753
vector k. For each k ∈R3 \ {0} and fr : R3 →C (r = 1, 2), the C3-valued
function
u(±)
k,r (t, x) := fr(k)e(r)(k)e±i|k|t∓ik·x
on M4 are solutions to (11.12). These are called plane wave solutions.
Physically, each of u±
k,r describes a plane wave with wave number vector
k and polarization e(r)(k). These plane waves are transversal waves since
the direction of oscillation (the direction of e(r)(k)) is perpendicular to the
direction of movement (the direction of k). Thus, the free electromagnetic
vector potential A given by (11.14) can be viewed as a superposition of
transversal plane waves.
According to the classical theory of electromagnetism, the energy Hcl

11.3
Quantum Radiation Field
We are now ready to construct a quantum version of an electromagnetic
vector potential in the Coulomb gauge. The construction can be done in
the same way as in the case of a free de Broglie ﬁeld or a free KG ﬁeld.
Namely, we deﬁne an operator-valued distribution a(r)(f ∗) (f ∈S (R3),
r = 1, 2) acting in a Hilbert space H such that its operator-valued distri-
bution kernel a(r)(k) (k ∈R3) satisﬁes the commutation relations
[a(r)(k), a(s)(k′)∗] = δrsδ(k −k′),
(11.15)
[a(r)(k), a(s)(k′)] = 0,
[a(r)(k), a(s)(k′)] = 0,
r, s = 1, 2,
(11.16)
on a dense subspace of H , and we replace a(r)
cl (k) in (11.14) by a(r)(k) to
obtain a quantum version of Aj(t, x).
For mathematical generality, we consider the case where R3 is replaced
by Rd (d ≥2).3 It is easy to extend the discussions in the preceding section
to the present case.
We construct a quantum version corresponding to a classical electro-
magnetic vector potential as an operator-valued distribution acting in the
boson Fock space
Frad := Fb(E ) =


n=0
⊗n
s E
(11.17)
over the (d −1) direct sum
E := ⊕d−1L2(Rd
k)
of L2(Rd
k).
As in the three-dimensional case, for each k ∈Rd \ {0}, there exists an
orthonormal basis {k/|k|, e(1)(k), . . . , e(d−1)(k)} of Rd:
e(r)(k) · e(s)(k) = δrs,
e(r)(k) · k = 0,
r, s = 1, . . . , d −1.
The unit vectors e(r)(k) are called polarization vectors with wave num-
ber vector k in the d-dimensional space.
Remark 11.3. The choice of polarization vectors is not unique. If d ≥3,
then the vector-valued function e(r) : Rd \ {0} →Rd cannot be continuous
on the whole space Rd \ {0}. This is due to the fact that, if d ≥3, then
3It is important to consider the dimensional dependence of a quantum theory because
it may bring one a deeper cognition of the conceptual structures underlying quantum
phenomena.
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
755
the parallel translations on the (d −1)-dimensional unit sphere Sd−1 =
{k ∈Rd| |k| = 1} are not commutative. However, as the following example
shows, one can take each e(r) to be continuous except on a null set.
Example 11.1. For j = 1, . . . , d, we deﬁne Mj := {k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈
Rd|kj = 0} and set S := Rd \

∪d
j=1Mj

= ∩d
j=1M c
j . For each k ∈S and
r = 1, . . . , d −1, we deﬁne a vector w(r)(k) ∈Rd by
w(r)(k) = (0, 0, . . . , 0,
rth
⌣
kr, 0, . . . , 0).
It is easy to see that the vectors k, w(1)(k), . . . , e(d−1) are linearly indepen-
dent. By applying the Gramm–Schmidt orthogonalization method to these
vectors, we obtain an orthonormal basis {k/|k|, e(1)(k), . . . , e(d−1)(k)} of
Rd. Since each w(r) is continuous on S, so is each e(r). We extend the
domain of e(r) to Rd by e(r)(k) := 0 for k ∈Sc. The Lebesgue measure of
Sc = ∪d
j=1Mj is zero. Hence, e(r) is a.e. continuous.
We denote by a(f) (f := (fr)d−1
r=1 ∈E ) the annihilation operator on
Frad with test vector f and by Nrad the number operator on Frad. For
each f ∈L2(Rd
k) and r = 1, . . . , d −1, we deﬁne fr ∈E by
fr = (0, . . . , 0,
rth
⌣
f , 0, . . . , 0)
and set
a(r)(f) := a(fr).
As in Example 8.5, the correspondence a(r) : S (Rd) ∋f →a(r)(f ∗) gives
an operator-valued distribution with values in L(Frad) and common domain
D(N 1/2
rad ). We call a(r)(f) (f ∈L2(Rd)) the photon annihilation oper-
ator with the test function f. The adjoint a(r)(f)∗is called the photon
creation operator with the test function f.
We denote by a(r)(k) (resp., a(r)(k)∗) the operator-valued distribution
kernel of a(r)(f ∗) (resp., a(r)(f)∗):
a(r)(f) =

Rd f(k)∗a(r)(k)dk,
a(r)(f)∗=

Rd f(k)a(r)(k)∗dk.
It follows that, for all f, g ∈L2(Rd
k) and r, s = 1, . . . , d −1,
[a(r)(f), a(s)(g)∗] = δrs ⟨f, g⟩,
(11.18)
[a(r)(f), a(s)(g)] = 0,
[a(r)(f)∗, a(s)(g)∗] = 0

on the ﬁnite particle subspace Fb,0(E ). Hence, in symbolic expressions, we
have (11.15) and (11.16). Thus, the desired operator-valued distributions
are constructed.
For each f ∈L1(R1+d), we deﬁne a function F0f on Rd
k by
(F0f)(k) :=
1
(2π)(1+d)/2

R1+d f(t, x)ei|k|t−ik·xdtdx

The mapping F0 is the transformation F with m = 0 (see (10.36)) extended
to L1(R1+d).
We introduce a function ωph on Rd by
ωph(k) := |k|,
k ∈Rd.
Physically, ωph(k) means the angular frequency of a photon with momen-
tum k.
Based on the classical result (11.14) and the aforementioned scheme for
obtaining a quantum version of the classical electromagnetic vector poten-
tial, it is natural to deﬁne a smeared operator Aj(f) with a test function f
in the set
Lph(R1+d) := {f ∈L1(R1+d)|F0f/√ωph ∈L2(Rd)}

is an operator-valued distribution with values in L(Frad) and common
domain D(N 1/2
rad )).
(ii) If f ∈Lph(R1+d) is real-valued, then Aj(f) (j = 1, . . . , d) is essentially
self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(E ).
(iii) (cyclicity) Let ΩE be the Fock vacuum in Frad. Then, the subspace
Drad := span

ΩE , Aj1(fj1) · · · Ajn(fjn)ΩE |n ≥1,
ji = 1, . . . , d, fji ∈S (R1+d)

is dense in Frad.
(iv) (free wave equation) For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ), f ∈S (R1+d) and j =
1, . . . , d,
Aj(□f)Ψ = 0.
(v) (Coulomb gauge condition) For all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ) and f ∈S (R1+d),
d
	
j=1
Aj(∂jf)Ψ = 0.
(11.21)
Proof.
(i) It is similar to the proof of Lemma 10.5.
(ii) Let ΦS(·) be the Segal ﬁeld operator on Frad, and for j = 1, . . . , d,
Tj(f) := (ω−1/2
ph
e(r)
j F0f)d−1
r=1 ∈E ,
f ∈Lph(R1+d).
Then, we have
Aj(f) =
√
2πΦS(Tj(f)),
f ∈Lph,R(R1+d),
(11.22)
where
Lph,R(R1+d) := {f ∈Lph(R1+d)|f ∗= f}.
Hence, by an application of Theorem 5.23, Aj(f) with f ∈Lph,R(R1+d)
is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,ﬁn(E ).

(iii) We ﬁrst show that the subspace
D1,rad := span

Tj(f)|f ∈S (R1+d), j = 1, . . . , d
 
is dense in E . Let g = (g(r))d−1
r=1 ∈D1,rad
⊥. Then, for all f ∈S (R1+d)
and j = 1, . . . , d, ⟨g, Tj(f)⟩= 0, which means that
!d−1

Let f = ˆv × ˇu with v ∈C∞

0 (Rd
k). Then,
!d−1
	
r=1
g(r)e(r)

= 0.
Hence, by Lemma 10.9, d−1
r=1 g(r)(k)e(r)
j (k) = 0, a.e. k. By mul-
tiplying both sides by e(s)
j (k) (s = 1, . . . , d −1), then taking the
sum over j, and using the orthonormality of {e(r)(k)}d−1
r=1, we obtain
g(s)(k) = 0, a.e. k. Hence, g = 0. Thus, D1,rad is dense in E .
Using the above fact and (11.22), one can prove the density of Drad
in Frad in the same manner as in the proof of Theorem 10.11.
(iv) It is similar to the proof of Lemma 10.7.
(v) As is easily seen, for each j = 1, . . . , d,
(F0∂jf)(k) = ikj(F0f)(k),
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd.
Hence,
d
	
j=1
e(r)
j (k)(F0∂jf)(k) = 0,
r = 1, . . . , d −1,
which implies (11.21).
□
The operator vector
A(f) := (A1(f), . . . , Ad(f))
(f ∈Lph(R1+d))
is called the free quantum radiation ﬁeld, or the free photon ﬁeld, in
the Coulomb gauge.
Theorem 11.1(iv) and (v) show that the free quantum radiation ﬁeld
obeys the d’Alembert equation and the Coulomb gauge condition in the
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields

sense of operator-valued distribution. In this way, a quantum version of a
classical free electromagnetic vector potential is constructed.

Using (11.18) and (11.19), we have for j, l = 1, . . . , d,

As a variant of the tempered distribution Δ+ introduced in Chapter 10,
one can deﬁne a tempered distribution Δ(+)
jl
∈S ′(R1+d) using
Δ(+)
jl (f) :=
π
(2π)(1+d)/2i

Rd ejl(k)

|k|
dk, f ∈S (R1+d).
We introduce a tempered distribution Δjl ∈S ′(R1+d) using
Δjl(f) := Δ(+)
jl (f) −Δ(+)
jl ( ˜f),
f ∈S (R1+d),
where ˜f(x) := f(−x), x ∈R1+d. In terms of Δjl, (11.23) is written as
[Aj(f), Al(g)] = i

R1+d f(x)(Δjl ∗g)(x)dx = i(Δjl ∗g)(f),
where Δjl ∗g denotes the convolution of Δjl and g (see Appendix D).
To obtain a more explicit form of ejl, one only needs to apply the fol-
lowing elementary fact.
Lemma 11.1. Let {v1, . . . , vd} be an orthonormal basis of Rd, with vj =
(vj1, vj2, . . . , vjd) ∈Rd. Then,
d
	
p=1
vpjvpl = δjl,
j, l = 1, . . . , d.
(11.24)
Proof. Each vector x = (x1, . . . , xd) ∈Rd is expanded as
x =
d
	
p=1
(vp · x)vp.

Since x1, . . . , xd are arbitrary real numbers, (11.24) follows.
□
Formula (11.24) is sometimes referred to as the completeness of the
orthonormal system (ONS) {vp}d
p=1 in the physics literature (note that
it is equivalent to (11.25), the completeness of the ONS {vp}d
p=1 in the sense
of mathematics literature).
Applying Lemma 11.1 to the orthonormal basis {k/|k|, e(1)(k), . . . ,
e(d−1)(k)}, we obtain
ejl(k) = δjl −kjkl
|k|2 ,
j, l = 1, . . . , d.
(11.26)
Hence, the distribution Δ(+)
jl
is represented as
Δ(+)

It is obvious that the functional S (R1+d) ∋f →Δ+,0(f) can be
extended to all f ∈L1(R1+d) such that

Rd |k|−1| ˆf(|k|, k)|dk < ∞. We
denote this extension by the same symbol Δ+,0(f).
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
761
It is easy to see that
−kjkl
|k|2 ˆf(|k|, k) = (F1+dΔ−1∂l∂jf)(|k|, k).
Hence,
Fjl(f) = Δ+,0(Δ−1∂j∂lf).
Therefore,
Δ(+)
jl (f) = δjlΔ+,0(f) + Δ+,0(Δ−1∂j∂lf),
f ∈S (R1+d).
Thus, introducing
Δph(f) := Δ+,0(f) −Δ+,0( ˜f),
we obtain
Δjl(f) = δjlΔph(f) + Δph(Δ−1∂j∂lf).
Example 11.2. Consider the case d = 3. Then, by (10.54),
Δ+,0(t, x) = −
1
4π|x|δ(|x| −t)
and by (10.55),
Δph(x) = −1
2πδ(x2).

Vacuum Expectation Values
It follows from (11.20) that the two-point vacuum expectation values
(VEVs) are given by
⟨ΩE , Aj(f)Al(g)ΩE ⟩= i(Δ(+)

Quantum Electromagnetic Fields
In correspondence to formulae (11.1) and (11.2) in the classical theory, it is
natural to deﬁne a quantum electric ﬁeld E(f) = (E1(f), E2(f), E3(f))
and a quantum magnetic ﬁeld B(f) = (B1(f), B2(f), B3(f)) with f ∈
S (R1+d) as follows:
Ej(f) := Aj(∂tf),
B1(f) := A2(∂3f) −A3(∂2f),
B2(f) := A3(∂1f) −A1(∂3f),
B3(f) := A1(∂2f) −A2(∂1f),
where (11.11) is taken into account to deﬁne Ej(f). According to
Theorem 11.1(iv), we have
Ej(□f) = 0,
Bj(□f) = 0
(j = 1, 2, 3)
on D(N 1/2
rad ). Namely, Ej and Bj obey the d’Alembert equation in the sense
of distribution. Moreover, Theorem 11.1(v) implies that
3
	
j=1
Ej(∂jf) = 0
on D(N 1/2

Sharp-Time Fields
Let
M−1/2(Rd) := {f ∈S ′(Rd)| ˆf/√ωph ∈L2(Rd
k)},
and for each t ∈R and f ∈M−1/2(Rd), deﬁne an operator Aj(t, f)

(11.30)
The correspondence :f →Aj(t, f) is called the sharp-time free quantum
radiation ﬁeld at time t.
It is easy to see that the mapping S (Rd) ∋f →Aj(t, f) is an operator-
valued distribution with values in L(Frad) and common domain D(N 1/2
rad ).
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields

Moreover, for all g ∈S (R), f ∈S (Rd

rad ),
Aj(g × f)Ψ =

where the integral is taken in the strong sense.
As is easily seen, for all t ∈R, f, g ∈S (Rd) and j, l = 1, . . . , d, we have
[Aj(t, f), Al(t, g)] = 0
on Fb,0(E ). Namely, for each t ∈R, {Aj(t, f)|j = 1, . . . , d, f ∈S (Rd)} is
a family of commuting operators on Fb,0(E ).
Deﬁnition (11.30) means that the operator-valued distribution kernel

Theorem 11.2.
(i) If f ∈M−1/2(Rd) is real-valued, then Aj(t, f) (t ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d) is

written in terms of two-point VEVs.
11.8
Canonical Conjugate Field
In the classical theory of electromagnetic ﬁelds, the canonical conjugate
momentum (ﬁeld) of the electromagnetic vector potential is given by its
time derivative. Hence, in quantum theory too, it may be natural to
deﬁne the canonical conjugate momentum operator as the time derivative
of the sharp-time free quantum radiation ﬁeld. Noting (11.33), we deﬁne
the canonical conjugate ﬁeld, or canonical conjugate momentum,
πj(t, f) (t ∈R, f ∈S (Rd), j = 1, . . . , d) of Aj(t, f) by

πj(t, f)Ψ = ∂tAj(t, f)Ψ,
f ∈S (Rd

It is easy to see that, for all t ∈R and f, g ∈S (Rd),
[πj(t, f), πl(t, g)] = 0
on Fb,0(E ).
Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Fields
765
Remark 11.4. As is easily seen, πj(t, f) can also be deﬁned for f ∈S ′(Rd)
such that √ωph ˆf ∈L2(Rd
k).
Through simple, direct computations, we see that for all s, t ∈R, f, g ∈
S (Rd) and j, l = 1, . . . , d
[Aj(t, f), πl(s, g)] = i

Rd ejl(k) ˆf(k)ˆg(−k) cos(|k|(t −s))dk
on Fb,0(E ), where we have used the fact that ejl(k) = ejl(−k) (see (11.26)).
In particular, in the case of equal-time s = t, we have
[Aj(t, f), πl(t, g)] = i

Rd ejl(k) ˆf(k)ˆg(−k)dk.
To rewrite the right-hand side, we introduce a linear functional
δtr
jl: S (Rd) →C (j, l = 1, . . . , d) by
δtr
jl(f) :=
1

It is easy to see that δtr
jl ∈S ′(Rd). We call this tempered distribution the
transverse delta distribution. In terms of this distribution, we have
[Aj(t, f), πl(t, g)] = i(δtr
jl ∗g)(f).
Note
that
the
right-hand
side
is
not
equal
to
i ⟨f ∗, g⟩.
Hence,
{Aj(t, f), πj(t, g)|t ∈R, f, g ∈S (Rd), j = 1, . . . , d} does not satisfy
Heisenberg CCR.

Hamiltonian and Momentum Operator
The function ωph gives the self-adjoint operator

Hrad := dΓb(hrad)
(11.34)
of hrad is called the Hamiltonian of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld.
Indeed, we have the following theorem.

The momentum operator of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld
(Prad,1, . . . , Prad,d) is deﬁned by
Prad,j := dΓb(⊕d−1kj),
where kj (= −kj) denotes the multiplication operator on L2(Rd
k) by kj
(⊕d−1kj is a self-adjoint operator on E ).
As in the case of the energy–momentum operator of the free neutral
quantum KG ﬁeld, the energy–momentum operator
Prad := (Hrad, Prad,1, . . . , Prad,d)
of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld is strongly commuting. In the same way
as in the proof of Theorem 11.3, the following theorem is proved.
Theorem 11.4.
(i) For all a = (a1, . . . , ad) ∈Rd, f ∈S (R1+d), Ψ ∈D(N 1/2
rad ) and
j = 1, . . . , d,

Aj(t, fa)Ψ = eid
j=1 ajPrad,jAj(t, f)e−id
j=1 ajPrad,jΨ.
Applying Theorem 5.3, we obtain the following results on the spectra
of Hrad and Prad,j:
σ(Hrad) = [0, ∞),
σp(Hrad) = {0},
σ(Prad,j) = R,
σp(Prad,j) = {0}, j = 1, . . . , d,
where ker Hrad = ker Prad,j = {αΩE |α ∈C}. In particular, the ground state
of Hrad is unique, with the ground-state energy being zero.
Note that the eigenvalue 0 of Hrad is an embedded eigenvalue (an eigen-
value embedded in the continuous spectrum). This comes from the fact that
the mass of a photon is zero.
The energy–momentum spectrum of the free quantum radiation ﬁeld
(the joint spectrum of Prad) is found to be
σJ(Prad) = V +.
The method of proof is similar to that of Theorem 10.9.

for all Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

The Hilbert space ⊗d−1Fb(L2(Rd

crete Hilbert space, as shown in the following. By Theorem 5.7(ii) and
Example 5.2, we have

natural way to the Hilbert space

Chapter 12
Free Quantum Dirac Field
As a basic example of fermionic relativistic quantum ﬁelds, we describe a quantum
ﬁeld of a free relativistic charged particle with spin 1/2.
12.1
Classical Theory of the Free Dirac Field
A relativistic charged particle with spin 1/2 (e.g., electron, proton, . . .)
is called a Dirac particle. In this chapter, we describe a mathematical
construction of the quantum ﬁeld whose quanta are free identical Dirac
particles. This quantum ﬁeld is called the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. But
we ﬁrst discuss the classical free Dirac ﬁeld.
12.1.1
Free Dirac equation
We denote by M4 the four-dimensional Minkowski space-time, as before,
and by
g = (gμν) =

the standard matrix representation of the metric tensor of M4. The matrix
components of g−1 are denoted gμν: g−1 = (gμν). It follows that
gμν = gμν,
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
For a natural number n ≥2, we denote by In the n × n identity matrix.
But sometimes we omit the subscript n in In.
775
776
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A set {γμ ∈M4(C)|μ = 0, 1, 2, 3} of 4 × 4 complex matrices is called a
representation of the gamma (γ)-matrices associated with M4 if they
satisfy anti-commutation relations
{γμ, γν} = 2gμνI4, μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.1)
where {X, Y } := XY + Y X, and (γ0)∗= γ0 (Hermiteness), (γj)∗= −γj,
j = 1, 2, 3 (anti-Hermiteness).
Remark 12.1. The algebra generated by elements θμ, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3, with
unit element I satisfying {θμ, θν} = 2gμνI (μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3) is called the
Cliﬀord algebra associated with M4. Precisely, {γμ ∈M4(C)|μ = 0,
1, 2, 3} should be called a representation of the algebra. But we follow the
convention in the physics literature.
The following two examples of representation of the γ-matrices are basic
ones.
Example 12.1. Let σ := (σ1, σ2, σ3) be the set of the Pauli matrices:
σ1 :=

0
1
1
0
	
,
σ2 :=

0
−i
i
0
	
,
σ3 :=

1
0
0
−1
	
.
(12.2)
Then, the following {γμ}3
μ=0 is a representation of the γ-matrices:
γ0 =

0
I2
I2
0
	
,
γj =

0
−σj
σj
0
	
,
j = 1, 2, 3.
(12.3)
This representation is called the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices.
For an origin of the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices and related
aspects, see Problem 12.10.
Example 12.2 (Standard representation of the γ-matrices).
γ0 :=

I2
0
0
−I2
	
,
γj =

0
σj
−σj
0
	
,
j = 1, 2, 3.
(12.4)
Hence, in the present representation of γ-matrices, γ0 is diagonalized,
showing that σ(γ0) = σp(γ0) = {±1}, with the multiplicity of each eigen-
value being 2.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
777
It is easy to see that, for any representation {γμ}μ=0,1,2,3 of the
γ-matrices and all unitary matrices U ∈M4(C), {UγμU −1}μ=0,1,2,3 is
a representation of γ-matrices. More generally, one has the following
important fact.
Lemma 12.1 (Pauli’s lemma). Let {γμ
1 }3
μ=0 and {γμ
2 }3
μ=0 be two sets
of 4 × 4 matrices satisfying the anti-commutation relations (12.1) with γμ
replaced by γμ
j (j = 1, 2, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3). Then, there is an invertible (regular)
matrix S ∈M4(C) such that
γμ
2 = Sγμ
1 S−1,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.5)
The matrix S is uniquely determined up to scalar multiples.
Proof. Let {γμ}3
μ=0 be the Weyl representation of γ-matrices. Then, by
Lemma 2.25 in Thaller (1992), there is an invertible (regular) matrix Sj ∈
M4(C) such that
γμ
j = SjγμS−1
j
,
j = 1, 2, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Hence, letting S := S2S−1
1 , we obtain (12.5).
To prove the second half of the lemma, let S′ ∈M4(C) be an invert-
ible matrix satisfying γμ
2 = S′γμ
1 S′−1, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Then, γμ
1 (S−1S′) =
(S−1S′)γ1. Since {γμ
1 |μ = 0, 1, 2, 3} is irreducible, it follows that S−1S′ =
cI4 with a constant c ∈C. Hence, S′ = cS.
□
In Lemma 12.1, the Hermiteness of γ0
j and the anti-Hermiteness of γk
j
(k = 1, 2, 3) are not assumed. Hence, S is not necessarily unitary. However,
if these properties are assumed, then S can be considered unitary.
Lemma 12.2. Let {γμ′}3
μ=0 and {γμ}3
μ=0 be two representations of the
γ-matrices associated with M4. Then, there is a unitary matrix U ∈M4(C)
such that
γμ′ = UγμU −1,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.6)
The unitary matrix U is uniquely determined up to scalar multiples by
eiθ (θ ∈R).
Proof. By Lemma 12.1, there exists an invertible matrix S ∈M4(C)
satisfying γμ′ = SγμS−1, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Taking the Hermitian conjugate of
this equation, we have γμ′ = S∗−1γμS∗. Hence, [γμ, S∗S] = 0, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Therefore, by the irreducibility of {γμ|μ = 0, 1, 2, 3}, S∗S = cI4 with a
778
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
constant c ∈C. Note that S∗S is positive and invertible. Hence, c > 0.
Hence, the matrix U := S/√c is unitary satisfying (12.6). The second half
of the lemma can be proven in the same way as in the proof of the second
half of Lemma 12.1.
□
Lemma 12.2 allows one to transform relations in a speciﬁc representation
of γ-matrices to those in any representation of γ-matrices. Hence, without
loss of generality, one can work with a speciﬁc representation of γ-matrices.
But, in what follows, we work with any representation of the γ-matrices
unless otherwise stated.
Example 12.3. Let {γμ}μ=0,1,2,3 be the Weyl representation of the
γ-matrices and
U :=
1
√
2

I2
I2
I2
−I2
	
.
Then, U is a unitary matrix and {UγμU −1}μ=0,1,2,3 is the standard
representation of the γ-matrices.
A point in M4 is denoted as x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) = (x0, x), with x0 =
x0 = t (time coordinate), xj = −xj, j = 1, 2, 3 (we use a physical unit
system, where c = 1 and ℏ= 1).
Let M ≥0 be a constant. Then, the ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential
equation
(iγμ∂μ −M)ψ(x) = 0
(12.7)
for a C4-valued function ψ : M4 →C4
ψ(x) =

is called the free Dirac equation with mass M, where, as before, ∂μ :=
∂/∂xμ and, in γμ∂μ, the summation over μ from 0 to 3 is understood
(Einstein’s convention).1
1For a heuristic derivation of the free Dirac equation, see Dirac (1958), Chapter XI,
or textbooks on relativistic quantum mechanics. Equation (12.7) with c and ℏrecovered
takes the following form:
⎛
⎝iℏ
c γ0∂0 +
3

j=1
iℏγj∂j −Mc
⎞
⎠ψ(x) = 0.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
779
A non-zero solution ψ : M4 →C4 to (12.7) (ψ ̸= 0) is called a free
classical Dirac ﬁeld, or a free Dirac spinor. This physically describes
a classical matter ﬁeld (matter wave) associated with a free Dirac particle
of mass M. A free classical Dirac ﬁeld with M > 0 (resp., M = 0) is said
to be massive (resp., massless).
12.1.2
A remark in connection with the quantum theory
of a Dirac particle
Multiplying (12.7) by γ0 and using (γ0)2 = I4, one has
i∂ψ(t, x)
∂t
=
⎛
⎝−i
3

j=1
αjDj + βM
⎞
⎠ψ(t, x),
(12.8)
where
αj := γ0γj (j = 1, 2, 3),
β := γ0,
(12.9)
and we have replaced ∂j by the generalized partial diﬀerential operator
Dj in xj. Equation (12.8) is also called the free Dirac equation with
mass M. A feature of this equation is that it can be viewed as the time-
development equation for the state vectors of the quantum system with
Hamiltonian
hD := −i
3

j=1
αjDj + βM,
(12.10)
the free Dirac Hamiltonian with mass M, acting in the Hilbert space
L2(R3; C4) of C4-valued square integrable functions on R3 with respect to
the Lebesgue measure on R3 (cf. Chapter 7, Problem 6). From this point
of view, (12.8) can be interpreted as an equation which describes the time
development for the state vectors of the quantum system of a free Dirac
particle of mass M. In this interpretation, ψ(t, ·) denotes a state vector of

It is easy to see that the matrices αj (j = 1, 2, 3) and β are Hermitian
matrices satisfying the anti-commutation relations
{αj, αk} = 2δjkI4,
β2 = I4,
{αj, β} = 0,
j, k = 1, 2, 3.

Discrete symmetries in the free Dirac equation
As is shown later (Section 12.1.5), the free Dirac equation has a relativistic
symmetry. But, before discussing it, it may be instructive to study discrete
symmetries of the free Dirac equation with respect to space inversion, charge
conjugation and time reversal.
Let I0 and Is be the time reversal and space inversion on R1+3, respec-
tively (see (8.75) and (8.76)) and C be a 4 × 4-matrix satisfying
CγμC−1 = −γμ,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.12)
where, for a matrix T , T denotes the complex conjugate of T . In the Weyl
representation of the γ-matrices, a choice of C is given by
C = −iγ2.
We also need a matrix
γ5 := iγ0γ1γ2γ3
(12.13)
to deﬁne a transformation of a C4-valued function on M4. The matrix γ5
is called the chiral operator in the context of the theory of Dirac ﬁelds.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
781
Its physical meaning will become clear later (see Proposition 12.1 and Sec-
tion 12.2). Note that γ5 is Hermitian and
γ5 = −iα1α2α3.
(12.14)
For a C4-valued function ψ : R4 →C4, we deﬁne functions ψs, ψc, ψt :
R4 →C4 as follows:
(space-inversion)
ψs(x) := γ0ψ(Isx),
(12.15)
(charge conjugation)
ψc(x) := C−1ψ(x)∗,
(12.16)
(time-reversal)
ψt(x) := γ0γ5C−1ψ(Itx)∗.
(12.17)
Example 12.6. In the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices, one has
γ5 =

I2
0
0
−I2
	
.
Hence, in the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices, γ5 is diagonalized,
showing that it has eigenvalues ±1 whose multiplicity is 2. For this reason,
the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices is also called the chiral repre-
sentation.
Example 12.7. In the standard representation of the γ-matrices, one has
γ5 =

0
I2
I2
0

Theorem 12.1 (P, C, T symmetries). Suppose that ψ is a solution to
the free Dirac equation (12.7). Then, for # = s, c, t, ψ# is a solution to the
free Dirac equation.
Proof. We have
∂0ψs(x) = γ0(∂0ψ)(Isx), ∂jψs(x) = −γ0(∂jψ)(Isx).
Hence, using γjγ0 = −γ0γj, we have
iγμ∂μψs(x) = γ0(iγμ∂μψ)(Isx) = γ0Mψ(Isx) = Mψs(x).
Therefore, ψs satisﬁes (12.7).
Note that (12.12) implies
γμC−1 = −C−1γμ.
782
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Using this property, we have
iγμ∂μψc(x) = C−1iγμ∂μψ(x) = C−1Mψ(x)∗= Mψc(x).
Hence, ψc is a solution to (12.7).
We have
ψt(x) = γ0γ5ψc(Itx).
Hence,
∂0ψt(x) = −γ0γ5(∂0ψc)(Itx), ∂jψt(x) = γ0γ5(∂jψc)(Itx).
Using anti-commutation relations (12.1), we have (see Problem 12.10 for
properties of the matrix γ5)
{γ5, γμ} = 0,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.18)
Using these properties and that ψc obeys the free Dirac equation, as
is shown in the preceding paragraph, one sees that ψt is a solution to
(12.7).

The special linear group SL(2, C) and the
four-dimensional proper Lorentz group
A free Dirac ﬁeld has a kind of relativistic covariance. This section is devoted
to a preliminary to formulate it.
We denote by SL(2, C) the set of 2 × 2 complex matrices whose deter-
minant is 1:
SL(2, C) := {A ∈M2(C)| det A = 1}.
It is easy to see that SL(2, C) forms a group with the operation of matrix
multiplication (see Appendix F). This group is called the complex special
linear group of degree 2. A vector in a two-dimensional representation
space of SL(2, C) is called a spinor.
For matrices T, S ∈M2(C), we deﬁne ⟨T, S⟩∈C by
⟨T, S⟩:= Tr (T ∗S),
where Tr denotes a trace. It is easy to check that this ⟨· , · ⟩is an inner
product of M2(C) and M2(C) becomes a four-dimensional complex Hilbert
space with the inner product. For notational simplicity, we denote this
Hilbert space by the same symbol M2(C) again.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
783
Lemma 12.3.
Tr (σμσν) = 2δμν,
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.19)
Proof. Since σμσμ = σ0, for each μ, Tr (σμσμ) = 2. Hence, (12.19) holds
for μ = ν.
In the case where μ = 0 and ν ̸= 0, we have Tr (σμσν) = Tr σν = 0.
In the case where j ̸= k, j, k = 1, 2, 3, using the anti-commutation rela-
tions {σj, σk} = 0, we have Tr (σjσk) = −Tr (σkσj). By the symmetry of
trace, the right-hand side is equal to −Tr (σjσk). Hence, Tr (σjσk) = 0.
□
Relation (12.19) shows that {σμ/
√
2}3
μ=0 is an orthonormal basis of
M2(C). Hence, any T ∈M2(C) is uniquely expanded as
T =

Let
H(2) := {H ∈M2(C)|H∗= H},
the set of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices, and deﬁne a mapping h : M4 →H(2)
by
h(x) := x0σ0 +

j=1
xjσj =

x0 + x3
x1 −ix2
x1 + ix2
x0 −x3
	
,
x ∈M4.
(12.21)
It is easy to see that h is linear and
det h(x) = x2 = (x0)2 −x2.
(12.22)
Lemma 12.4. The mapping h is bijective.
Proof. By (12.21), h(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. Hence, h is injective.
For any T ∈H(2), let
x0
T := 1
2Tr (σ0T ),
xj
T := 1
2Tr (σjT ), j = 1, 2, 3.
Then, it is easy to see that xμ
T is a real number. By (12.20), we see that
h(xT ) = T . Hence, h is surjective.
□
Let A ∈SL(2, C). Then, for each x ∈M4, the matrix Ah(x)A∗is
Hermitian, i.e., Ah(x)A∗∈H(2). Hence, by Lemma 12.4, one can deﬁne a
784
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
mapping Λ(A) : M4 →M4 by
Λ(A)x := h−1(Ah(x)A∗),
x ∈M4.
(12.23)
Since h is linear, Λ(A) is linear. We have
h(Λ(A)x) = Ah(x)A∗.
(12.24)
Taking the determinant of both sides and using (12.22), we obtain
(Λ(A)x)2 = x2.
Hence, Λ(A) is a Lorentz transformation.
By (12.24) and (12.21), we have
(Λ(A)x)νσν = xνAσνA∗.
Multiplying σμ from the left and using (12.19), we obtain
2(Λ(A)x)μ = xνTr (σμAσνA∗).
This holds for all x ∈M4. Hence,
Λ(A)μ
ν = 1
2Tr (σμAσνA∗), μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.25)
It follows from (12.25) that Λ(A) is a continuous function of A. Note
that
Λ(I2) = I4.
(12.26)
On the other hand, SL(2, C) is simply connected (see, for example,
Yamanouchi and Sugiura, 1960, p. 142, Example 1). Hence, Λ(A) is an
element of L ↑
+, the four-dimensional proper Lorentz group. Thus, the cor-
respondence A 	→Λ(A) deﬁnes a mapping Λ(·) from SL(2, C) to L ↑
+. This
mapping has interesting properties.
Lemma 12.5.
(i) (homomorphism) For all A, B ∈SL(2, C).
Λ(AB) = Λ(A)Λ(B).
(12.27)
(ii) Let A, B ∈SL(2, C). Then, Λ(A) = Λ(B) if and only if A = B or
A = −B.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
785
Proof. (i) For all x ∈M4,
h(Λ(AB)x) = ABh(x)B∗A∗= Ah(Λ(B)x)A∗= h(Λ(A)Λ(B)x).
By this fact and the injectivity of h, Λ(AB)x = Λ(A)Λ(B)x, which implies
(12.27).
(ii) Suppose that Λ(A) = Λ(B). Then, for all x ∈M4, Ah(x)A∗=
Bh(x)B∗. This means that AσμA∗= BσμB∗, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Hence, the
matrix T := A−1B, which is in SL(2, C), satisﬁes T σμT ∗= σμ. This equa-
tion with μ = 0 implies that T is unitary. Hence, it follows that T σj = σjT ,
j = 1, 2, 3. It is easy to see that such a matrix T is a scalar matrix, i.e.,
T = λI2, for some constant λ ∈C. Since det T = 1, it follows that λ = ±1.
Hence, A = B or A = −B.
Conversely, suppose that A = ±B. Then, it immediately follows from
the deﬁnition of Λ(·) that Λ(A) = Λ(B).
□
Lemma 12.5(i) and (12.25) show that Λ : SL(2, C) →L ↑
+ is a continuous
representation of SL(2, C) on M4 (for terminologies in group theory, see
Section 2.9.2). Lemma 12.5(ii) means that N(Λ), the kernel of Λ, is {±I2}.
Namely, Λ is a two to one homomorphism from SL(2, C) to L ↑
+. Moreover,
the following fact is found.
Lemma 12.6. The homomorphism Λ is surjective: Λ(SL(2, C)) = L ↑
+.
Proof. Let sl(2, C) be the Lie algebra of SL(2, C) (see Example F.2 in
Appendix F) and g = l↑
+ be the Lie algebra of L ↑
+ (see Section 8.10.4). Then,
the diﬀerential representation dΛ of Λ (see Section F.2 in Appendix F) is a
homomorphism from sl(2, C) to g. Since N(Λ) = {±I2}, it follows that the
Lie algebra of N(Λ) is {0}. Hence, by Theorem F.2, ker dΛ = {0}. Hence,
dΛ is injective. It is easy to see that, as a real vector space, sl(2, C) is six-
dimensional. Also, dim g = 6 (apply Proposition 8.6 to the case d = 3).
Hence, dΛ is a bijection.
On the other hand, since L ↑
+ is connected, it follows from Theorem F.1
that any L ∈L ↑
+ is written in the form L = eX1 · · · eXN, with Xj ∈g.
So, taking Yj ∈sl(2, C) such that Xj = dΛ(Yj), we have L = Λ(A) with
A := eY1 · · · eYN ∈SL(2, C). Thus, Λ is surjective.
□
Remark 12.2. Another (direct) proof of Lemma 12.6 may be given by
showing that, for any Λ ∈L ↑
+, there exists an A ∈SL(2, C) satisfying
Λμ
ν = 1
2Tr (σμAσνA∗),
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(12.28)
786
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
See (12.25). Equation (12.28) is equivalent to a system of equations for the
matrix elements of A, which is explicitly solved.
Remark 12.3. A continuous mapping f from an arc-wise connected
topological space 
X onto a topological space X is called a covering map
if, for each point x ∈X , there exists an open neighborhood Vx such that
f is a homeomorphism from each connected component of f −1(Vx) onto
Vx. If such a mapping f exists, then 
X is called a covering space of X .
If X and 
X are topological groups and f is a homomorphism, then 
X is
called a covering group of X . In particular, if the group 
X is simply
connected, then 
X is called a universal covering group of X .
In terms of these concepts, the above results show that the mapping
Λ : SL(2, C) →L ↑
+ is a covering map and SL(2, C) is a universal covering
group of L ↑
+.
By Lemma 12.5, for any representation (λ, V ) of L ↑
+ (V
is a
representation space), there exists a representation (ρ, V ) of SL(2, C)
such that
ρ(A) = λ(Λ(A)),
A ∈SL(2, C).
But this representation is not faithful because ρ(A) = ρ(−A), for all A ∈
SL(2, C).
Conversely, suppose that a representation (ρ, V ) of SL(2, C) is given
with ρ(−I2) = IV . By Lemma 12.6, for each g ∈L ↑
+, there exists an Ag ∈
SL(2, C) such that Λ(±Ag) = g. We have ρ(−Ag) = ρ(−I2)ρ(Ag) = ρ(Ag).
Hence, one can deﬁne λ : L ↑
+ →GL(V ) by
λ(g) := ρ(Ag),
g ∈L ↑
+.
It follows that (λ, V ) is a representation of L ↑
+. Thus, the analysis of
representations of L ↑
+ can be reduced to the analysis of those of SL(2, C).
In this sense, SL(2, C) may be a more fundamental group.
Remark 12.4. In the case where ρ(−I2) ̸= IV , ρ(−Ag) ̸= ρ(Ag). Hence,
in this case, there is a correspondence: g 	→ρ(Ag) or ρ(−Ag). This
correspondence is called the double-valued representation of L ↑
+.
12.1.5
Relativistic covariance of the free Dirac equation
We are now ready to discuss a relativistic covariance of the free Dirac
equation.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
787
Lemma 12.7. For each Λ ∈L ↑
+, there exists an invertible matrix SΛ ∈
M4(C) such that, for μ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
S−1
Λ γμSΛ = Λμ
νγν.
(12.29)
The matrix SΛ is determined uniquely up to scalar multiples.
Proof. Let ρμ := Λμ
νγν (μ = 0, 1, 2, 3). Then, it is easy to see that
{ρμ, ρν} = 2gμν (μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3). Hence, by Pauli’s lemma (Lemma 12.1),
there exists an invertible matrix SΛ ∈M4(C) satisfying (12.29).
□
Let (a, Λ) ∈P↑
+ and SΛ be as in Lemma 12.7. For each ψ : M4 →C4,
we deﬁne ψ(a,Λ) : M4 →C4 by
ψ(a,Λ)(x) := SΛψ(Λ−1(x −a)),
x ∈M4.
(12.30)
Theorem 12.2. Let ψ be a solution to the free Dirac equation (12.7). Then,
ψ(a,Λ) is a solution to the free Dirac equation (12.7).
Proof. Let x′ := Λ−1(x −a) and φ := ψ(a,Λ). Then,
iγμ∂μφ(x) = i(Λ−1)ν
μγμSΛ∂νψ(x′)

(by (12.29))

αSΛγα∂νψ(x′)

Hence, φ satisﬁes (12.7).
□
By Lemma 12.7, for each Λ ∈L ↑
+, one can assign an invertible matrix
SΛ ∈GL(C4). Then, we have a family {SΛ|Λ ∈L ↑
+} of invertible matrices.
Using (12.29), we have for all Λ1, Λ2 ∈L ↑
+,
S−1
Λ1Λ2γμSΛ1Λ2 = S−1
Λ2 S−1
Λ1 γμSΛ1SΛ2,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Hence, letting T := SΛ1Λ2(SΛ1SΛ2)−1, we obtain
γμT = T γμ.
Since {γμ|μ = 0, 1, 2, 3} is irreducible (see, for example, Thaller, 1992, p. 77,
Appendix), it follows that T = c(Λ1, Λ2)I4, for some c(Λ1, Λ2) ∈C. Hence,
SΛ1Λ2 = c(Λ1, Λ2)SΛ1SΛ2.
788
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Therefore, if c(Λ1, Λ2) = 1, for all Λ1, Λ2 ∈L ↑
+, then the correspondence:
Λ 	→SΛ gives a representation of L ↑
+ on C4. But it is unclear if such
a choice of c(Λ1, Λ2) is possible. However, if one uses the homomorphism
Λ(·) : SL(2, C) →L ↑
+, then it is shown that such a choice is possible as
follows.
Lemma 12.8. Let {γμ}3
μ=0 be the Weyl representation of the γ-matrices
(see Example 12.1) and, for each A ∈SL(2, C), deﬁne Sw(A) ∈M4(C) by
Sw(A) :=

A

.
(12.31)
Then, Sw(A) is invertible, and
Sw(A)−1γμSw(A) = Λ(A)μ

μ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
(12.32)
Sw(AB) = Sw(A)Sw(B),
A, B ∈SL(2, C),
(12.33)
Sw(A)∗γ0Sw(A) = Sw(A)γ0Sw(A)∗= γ0.
(12.34)
Moreover, the correspondence : A 	→Sw(A) is continuous, with
Sw(A)∗= Sw(A∗),
A ∈SL(2, C).
(12.35)
Proof. Throughout the proof, we set S(A) := Sw(A). It is easy to see that
S(A) is invertible, with
S(A)−1 =

where σμ := gμνσν (μ = 0, 1, 2, 3). By (12.20), we have

789
By the symmetry of trace, we have
Tr (σαA∗σμA) = Tr (σμAσαA∗) = 2Λ(A)μ
α.
Hence,
A∗σμA =
3

α=0
Λ(A)μ

(12.36)
By (12.25) and the symmetry of trace, we have
Λ(A∗) = tΛ(A).
Hence, replacing A by A∗in (12.36), we obtain
AσμA∗= Λ(A)ν
μσν.
(12.37)
Since A−1 ∈SL(2, C), one can apply (12.37) to A replaced by A−1 to obtain
A−1σν(A∗)−1 = Λ(A−1)α
ν σα = (Λ(A)−1)α
ν σα
= (gtΛ(A)g)α
ν σα = gνλΛ(A)λ
βσβ.
Hence,
A−1σμ(A∗)−1 = gμνA−1σν(A∗)−1 = Λ(A)μ
νσν.
Thus, we obtain
S(A)−1γμS(A) = Λ(A)μ
νγν.
(12.38)
By direct computations, we have
S(AB) = S(A)S(B),
A, B ∈SL(2, C).
(12.39)
We have
S(A)∗=

A∗
0
0
A−1
	
= S(A∗).
Hence, (12.35) holds, and by direct computations, we obtain (12.34).
It is easy to see that the mapping A 	→(A∗)−1 is continuous. Hence,
S(A) is continuous in A.

Lemma 12.9. Let {γμ}μ=0,1,2,3 be any representation of γ-matrices. Then,
there exists an invertible matrix S(A) ∈M4(C) such that

(12.43)
Moreover, the correspondence : A 	→S(A) is continuous with
S(A)∗= S(A∗),
A ∈SL(2, C).
(12.44)
Proof. Let {γμ
w}3
μ=0 be the Weyl representation of γ-matrices. Then, by
Lemma 12.2, there exists a unitary matrix U ∈M4(C) such that Uγμ
wU −1 =
γμ. Let S(A) := USw(A)U −1. Then, by using Lemma 12.8, one easily sees
that S(A) is invertible and satisﬁes (12.40)–(12.43). Formula (12.44) follows
from (12.35).
□
Lemma 12.9 shows that S(·) : SL(2, C) →GL(C4); A 	→S(A) is a

transformation of the γ-matrices: γ = (γμ)3

μ=0.
Remark 12.6. A meaning of (12.42) and (12.43) is as follows. One can
deﬁne an indeﬁnite metric ⟨·, ·⟩0 on C4 by
⟨z, w⟩0 :=

z, γ0w

C4,
z, w ∈C4.
Equation (12.42) is equivalent to
⟨S(A)z, S(A)w⟩0 = ⟨z, w⟩0,
z, w ∈C4,
i.e., S(A) is an invertible linear mapping on C4 which leaves the metric
⟨·, ·⟩0 invariant. Similarly, (12.43) shows that S(A)∗leaves the metric ⟨·, ·⟩0
invariant.
Theorem 12.2 and Lemma 12.9 immediately yield the following result.
Corollary 12.1. Let {γμ}3

Suppose that ψ is a solution to the free Dirac equation (12.7).Then, so is
ψ(a,A).
The set

P↑

(12.46)
is a topological group with product operation
(a, A)(b, B) := (a + Λ(A)b, AB),
a, b ∈R4, A, B ∈SL(2, C).
Since SL(2, C) is a universal covering group of L ↑
+, it follows that 
P↑
+
is a universal covering group of the four-dimensional proper Poincar´e
group P↑
+.
Let
Map(M4; C4) := {ψ : M4 →C4}
(12.47)
be the vector space of mappings from M4 to C4 and, for each (a, A) ∈
P↑
+,
deﬁne a mapping V (a, A) : Map(M4; C4) →Map(M4; C4) by
V (a, A)ψ := ψ(a,A),
ψ ∈Map(M4; C4).
(12.48)
It is easy to see that {V (a, A)|(a, A) ∈
P↑

P↑

Let SFD be the space of solutions to the free Dirac equation (12.7):
SFD := {ψ : M4 →C4|ψ satisﬁes (12.7)}.
(12.49)
Theorem 12.3 (Poincar´e symmetry). For each (a, A) ∈
P↑
+, V (a, A)
SFD = SFD.
Proof. By Corollary (12.1), V (a, A)SFD ⊂SFD. Conversely, let ψ ∈SFD.
Then, noting that (a, A)−1 ∈
P↑
+, we see by Corollary (12.1) again that
φ := V ((a.A)−1)ψ ∈SFD. Since V ((a, A)−1) = V (a, A)−1, it follows that
V (a, A)φ = ψ. Hence, V (a, A)SFD = SFD.

respectively, give the free Dirac equation (12.7) and its adjoint form
i∂μψ(x)γμ + Mψ(x) = 0,
(12.50)
where ψ is the 1 × 4 matrix-valued function on M4, deﬁned by
ψ(x) := (ψ1(x)∗, ψ2(x)∗, ψ3(x)∗, ψ4(x)∗)γ0.
Hence, the canonical conjugate momentum π(x) = (πr(x))4
r=1 to ψ is
given by
πr := ∂L
∂˙ψr
= iψ∗
r,
r = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(12.51)
where ˙ψ := ∂ψ/∂x0 = ∂ψ/∂t. Therefore, the Hamiltonian (energy) density
H (x) takes the form
H (x) :=

r=1
πr(x) ˙ψr(x) −L (x) = ψ∗(x)(−iα · ∇+ βM)ψ(x),
where ∇:= (∂1, ∂2, ∂3), α := (α1, α2, α3) (see (12.9) for the deﬁnition of
αj and β) and α · ∇:= 3
j=1 αj∂j. Thus, the Hamiltonian is given by
Hcl(t) :=

R3 |ψr(x)|2dx < ∞,

R3 |∂jψr(x)|2dx < ∞, j = 1, 2, 3, r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
If ψ is a solution to (12.7), then, under a suitable condition, Hcl(t) is a
constant independently of t ∈R (Problem 12.10(i)). Hence, the total energy
of the free Dirac ﬁeld is conserved in time.
The momentum Pcl(t) := (P 1

(12.53)
In the same way as in the case of Hcl(t), it is shown that, under a suitable
condition for the free Dirac ﬁeld ψ, each P j
cl(t) is conserved in time (Problem
12.10(ii)).

j=1
ψ∗(t, x)αj∂jψ(t, x) + Mψ∗(t, x)βψ(t, x).

j=1
(∂jψ∗(t, x))αjψ(t, x) + Mψ∗(t, x)βψ(t, x).
Hence, letting

vψ(t, x) := (ψ∗(t, x)α1ψ(t, x), ψ∗(t, x)α2ψ(t, x), ψ∗(t, x)α3ψ(t, x)),

If one interprets ρψ(t, x) as the density of the matter ﬁeld ψ in the
space R3 and vψ(t, x) as the matter-ﬂow vector ﬁeld, then (12.54) can be
regarded as the continuous equation for the matter ﬁeld. Hence, under a
suitable condition,
Tψ :=

R3 ρψ(t, x)dx

According to the above interpretation of ψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x), it is natural to
identify qψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x) (resp., Mψ∗(t, x)ψ(t, x)) with the charge (resp.,
mass) density of the matter ﬁeld, where q is the charge of the free Dirac

Plane wave expansion of the free Dirac ﬁeld
Let us ﬁnd a general form of the free Dirac ﬁeld ψ(t, x). We assume that
ψ(t, ·) is a tempered distribution on R3 obeying (12.7) or (12.8) and that
its Fourier transform in the sense of distribution
ˆψ(t, k) =




R3 ψ(t, x)e−ik·xdx
(k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3)
is a function on R×R3
k, continuously diﬀerentiable in t ∈R, for each k ∈R3.
Considering the Fourier transform of (12.8), we have

where
ˆhD(k) := α · k + βM,
(12.58)
where α · k := 3
j=1 αjkj. For each k ∈R3, (12.57) is an ordinary linear
diﬀerential equation in t with a matrix coeﬃcient. Hence, if the eigenvalue
problem of the matrix ˆhD(k) is solved, then one can ﬁnd a general solu-
tion to (12.57) so that its inverse Fourier transform will give a general
form of solutions to (12.8). Thus, we ﬁrst solve the eigenvalue problem of
ˆhD(k).

We introduce a function E on R3 by

(12.59)

Lemma 12.10. For each k ∈R3, UD(k) is a unitary matrix and
UD(k)hD(k)UD(k)∗= E(k)β.
(12.61)
Proof. It is obvious that (12.61) holds for k = 0. Let k ̸= 0. Then, by the
Hermiteness and the anti-commutativity of αj and β (see (12.11)), we have
UD(k)∗= M + E(k) −βα · k

2E(k)(M + E(k))
.
(12.62)
Hence, by direct computations, we obtain
UD(k)∗UD(k) = 1,
UD(k)UD(k)∗= 1.
Hence, UD(k) is unitary. This implies that UD(k)−1 = UD(k)∗. Formula
(12.61) follows from this fact and direct computations.

E(k)β =

(12.66)
This shows that σ(E(k)β) = σp(E(k)β) = {±E(k)} and the multiplicity
of eigenvalues ±E(k) is 2. By Lemma 12.10 and the unitary invariance of
spectra, the statement of the theorem follows.
□
The eigenvalue E(k) (resp., −E(k)) of hD(k) is called the positive
(resp., negative) energy eigenvalue of hD(k).
Let
h±(k) := ker(hD(k) ∓E(k)),
k ∈KM
(12.67)
Then, it follows from Theorem 12.4 that
h+(k) ⊕h−(k) = C4,
dim h±(k) = 2,
k ∈KM.
(12.68)
Note that, in the case of M > 0, h±(0) = ker(β ∓1). We extend this
equation to the case of M = 0 for convenience. Then, denoting by P±(k)
the orthogonal projections onto h±(k), we have
P+(k) + P−(k) = I4,
k ∈R3.
(12.69)

The matrix

It follows from (12.11) that
{τ, β} = 0,

By Example 12.2, we have
dim U± = 2.
It follows from (12.61) that
h±(k) = UD(k)∗U±.
(12.75)
Lemma 12.11. The matrix τ is a unitary transformation from U±
onto U∓.
Proof. The ﬁrst anti-commutation relation in (12.72) implies that τU+ ⊂
U−. For any u ∈U−, v := τu is in U+ and τv = u. Hence, τU+ = U−.
This fact and the second property in (12.71) imply that τU−= U+.
□
Theorem 12.5. For all k ∈R3, τh±(k) = h∓(k).
Proof. By (12.72), one has
τˆhD(k) = −ˆhD(k)τ.
(12.76)
This implies that τh±(k) ⊂h∓(k). Since τ 2 = I4, it follows that τh±(k) =
h∓(k).
□
Theorem 12.5 means that τ transforms the eigenspace of ˆhD(k) with
the positive (resp., negative) energy eigenvalue onto that with the negative
(resp., positive) energy eigenvalue.
In terms of P±(k), a general solution to the diﬀerential equation to

equation (12.7). The former (resp., latter) is called the plane wave solu-
tion with positive (resp., negative) energy.

Spectral properties of the free Dirac operator
In connection with the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld constructed later, it is
important to know the basic properties of the free Dirac operator hD given
by (12.10).
Let F3 be the Fourier transform from L2(R3
x) to L2(R3
k):
(F3f)(k) :=


(2π)3

R3 e−ik·xf(x)dx,

in the L2-sense, where k · x := 3
j=1 kixj, k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3
k, x =

x. Since

F3hDF −1

= ˆhD,
(12.79)
where, by abuse of notation, F3 denotes the direct sum operator ⊕4F3 :
L2(R3

x) →L2(R3
k; C4) = ⊕4L2(R3

tion in what follows too) and the right-hand side denotes the multiplication
Free Quantum Dirac Field
799
operator on L2(R3
k; C4) by the matrix-valued function ˆhD(k) (this notation
applies to other matrix-valued functions too).
Let UD be given by (12.60) and
W := UDF3.
(12.80)
Then, by Lemma 12.10, W is unitary and
WhDW −1 = Eβ.
(12.81)
Since Eβ is self-adjoint on L2(R3
k; C4) and is unitarily equivalent to E ⊕
E ⊕(−E) ⊕(−E), we have
σ(Eβ) = (−∞, −M] ∪[M, ∞),
σp(Eβ) = ∅.
Thus, we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 12.6. The free Dirac operator hD is self-adjoint and
σ(hD) = (−∞, −M] ∪[M, ∞),
σp(hD) = ∅.
Remark 12.7. In fact, the spectrum of hD is purely absolutely continuous
since the spectrum of Eβ is as well.
We have
L2(R3; C4) = L2(R3; U+) ⊕L2(R3; U−).
Therefore, letting
D± := W −1L2(R3
k; U±),
(12.82)
we have
L2(R3
x; C4) = D+ ⊕D−.
(12.83)
It follows from (12.81) that hD is reduced by D± and hD is a positive (resp.,
negative) operator on D+ (resp., D−).
Example 12.10. In the standard representation of a γ-matrix, U± = C4
±
(see Example 12.8).
In relativistic quantum mechanics, the free Dirac operator hD can be
physically interpreted as the quantum Hamiltonian of a free Dirac particle
of mass M. In this interpretation, D+ (resp., D−) represents the subspace of
positive (resp., negative) energy states of the Dirac particle. In this context,
D+ and D−are called the positive energy subspace and the negative
energy subspace of the Dirac particle, respectively.

(12.87)
[s1, s2] = is3,
[s2, s3] = is1,
[s3, s1] = is2.
(12.88)
It follows that {s1, s2, s3} is a representation of the Lie algebra su(2, C) of
SU(2) on C4. It turns out that the operator vector
s := (s1, s2, s3)
(12.89)
is physically interpreted as the spin angular momentum of a Dirac
particle.
For each k ∈R3 \ {0}, we introduce a Hermitian matrix:
h(k) := s · ˆk,
(12.90)
where
ˆk := k

(12.91)
The matrix h(k) is called the helicity operator of the Dirac particle with

Since σ · ˆk is Hermitian and not equal to ±I2, it follows that σp(σ · ˆk) =
{±1} and the multiplicity of the eigenvalues ±1 is one, respectively. By this
fact, (12.92) and the unitary invariance of spectrum, one obtains (12.93)
and (12.94).
□
The eigenvalues ±1/2 of h(k) are called the helicities of the Dirac
particle under consideration, which physically mean the possible values of
the spin of the Dirac particle in the direction of the momentum k.

Hence, it follows that

its reduced parts by h±(k):

if and only if ker(h(k) −s) ∩h−(k) ̸= {0}. Hence, (12.95) holds.

Remark 12.8. It follows from Lemma 12.10 that the eigenvectors u(k, s)
and v(k, s) are explicitly given as follows:
u(k, s) = UD(k)∗us,
v(k, s) = UD(k)∗vs,
(12.99)
where {us|s = ±1/2} (resp., {vs|s = ±1/2}) is an orthonormal basis of U+
(resp., U−). Hence, if M > 0, then u(k, s) and v(k, s) as the functions of
k are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable on R3. But, in the case M = 0, u(k, s) and
v(k, s) as the functions of k are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable only on R3 \ {0}.
The following proposition conveys a physical meaning of the matrix γ5.
Proposition 12.1. The matrix γ5 preserves the helicity of a Dirac particle,
i.e., for all k ∈R3 \ {0} and s = ±1/2, γ5 ker(h(k) −s) = ker(h(k) −s).
Proof. It is easy to see that h(k)γ5 = γ5h(k) (commutativity), which
implies the desired result.

For each k ∈R3, {u(k, s)|s = ±1/2} and {v(k, s)|s = ±1/2} are
orthonormal bases of h+(k) and h−(k), respectively. Hence, we have for
all z ∈C4,

12.2
Parities and a Massless Dirac Field
In this section, we want to add a remark on the matrix γ5. We denote by
Map(M4, C4) the set of mappings from M4 to C4.
12.2.1
A space-inversion operator
Let ψs be the space inversion of ψ ∈Map(M4, C4) (see (12.15)), and deﬁne
a mapping Vs on Map(M4, C4) by
Vsψ := ψs.
Then,
V 2
s = I,
Vs ̸= ±I.
Hence, Vs has eigenvalues ±1, with
ker(Vs ∓1) = {ψ ∈Map(M4, C4)|γ0ψ(Isx) = ±ψ(x), ∀x ∈M4}.
For any ψ ∈Map(M4, C4), one has
ψ = ψ+ + ψ−,
with ψ± := (1 ± Vs)ψ/2 ∈ker(Vs ∓1). Hence,
Map(M4, C4) = ker(Vs −1) ⊕ker(Vs + 1).
We call Vs the space-inversion operator on Map(M4, C4).
The eigenvalue 1 (resp., −1) of Vs is called the even (resp., odd) parity.
An element of ker(Vs −1) (resp., ker(Vs + 1)) is said to have even (resp.,
odd) parity. Since {γ5, γ0} = 0, it follows that
γ5Vs = −Vsγ5.
(12.107)
This means that γ5 ker(Vs ±1) = ker(Vs ∓1), i.e., γ5 transforms a ﬁeld with
even (resp., odd) parity to a ﬁeld with odd (resp., even) parity.
12.2.2
Left-handed and right-handed ﬁelds
Let
PL := 1 −γ5
2
,
PR := 1 + γ5
2
.
Then, it is easy to see that PL and PR are orthogonal projections onto
ker(γ5 + 1) and ker(γ5 −1), respectively, and
PL + PR = I.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
805
Hence, each ψ : M4 →C4 can be decomposed as
ψ = ψL + ψR,
with ψL := PLψ and ψR := PRψ.
By (12.107), one has
VsPL = PRVs.
This means that the role of PL and PR exchanges under the transformation
by the space-inversion operator Vs. For this reason, ψL (resp., ψR) is called
the left-handed (resp., right-handed) component of ψ.2
A non-zero mapping ψ ∈Map(M4, C4) is said to be left-handed (resp.,
right-handed) if ψR = 0 (resp., ψL = 0).
Proposition 12.2. Suppose that ψ is a free Dirac ﬁeld. Then,
iγμ∂μψL −MψR = 0,
iγμ∂μψR −MψL = 0.
(12.108)
Proof. By (12.18), γ5ψ obeys the equation
iγμ∂μγ5ψ + Mγ5ψ = 0.
By subtracting (resp., adding) this equation from (resp., to) (12.7), we
obtain the ﬁrst (resp., second) equation in (12.108).
□
This proposition implies an interesting fact.
Corollary 12.2. There is no left-handed or right-handed massive free Dirac
ﬁeld.
Proof. Let ψ be a massive free Dirac ﬁeld such that ψR = 0. Then, by
the second equation of (12.108), MψL = 0. Since M > 0, ψL = 0. Hence,
ψ = 0. Therefore, there is no left-handed massive free Dirac ﬁeld. Similarly,
one can show that, if ψL = 0, then ψ = 0.
□
By this corollary, left-handed or right-handed free Dirac ﬁelds can exist
only in the massless case, M = 0. Hence, we next consider the massless
case.
2Recall that, in R3, the right-handed (resp., left-handed) system is transformed
into
the
left-handed
(resp.,
right-handed)
system
under
the
space

The massless free Dirac ﬁeld
Now, we use the Weyl representation of γ-matrices. Then, by Example 12.6,
we have
PL =

0
0
0
I2
	
,
PR =

I2
0
0
0
	
.
Hence, ψL and ψR can be written as follows:
ψR =

φR
0
	
,
ψL =

0
φL
	
,
φR =

ψ1
ψ2
	
,
φL =

ψ3
ψ4
	
.
We consider the massless free Dirac ﬁeld ψ:
iγμ∂μψ = 0.
Then, we have
i ∂
∂tφR = −iσ · DφR,
i ∂
∂tφL = iσ · DφL.
An equation of this type is called a Weyl equation.
We note that, in the massless case M = 0, E(k) = |k|. So, suppose that
φR(t, x) = wR(k)e−it|k|+ik·x,
φL(t, x) = wL(k)e−it|k|+ik·x,
(t, x) ∈M4, k ∈R3 \ {0},
with wR, wL : R3 →C2. Then, the above equations give
|k|wR(k) = σ · kwR(k),
|k|wL(k) = −σ · kwL(k).
By (12.92), we obtain
h(k) ˜wR(k) = 1
2 ˜wR(k),
h(k) ˜wL(k) = −1
2 ˜wL(k),
where
˜wR(k) :=

wR(k)
0
	
∈C4,
˜wL(k) :=

0
wL(k)
	
∈C4.
Hence, in the massless case, there exist a right-handed ﬁeld ψR with helicity
+1/2 and a left-handed ﬁeld ψL with helicity −1/2.

Deﬁnition of a sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld

ﬁeld
on
the
four-dimensional Minkowski space-time M4. To deﬁne it, we introduce a
notation.
For an N-component operator-valued distribution ϕ = (ϕr)N
r=1 on Rd
(N, d ∈N) and f = (fr)N
r=1 ∈⊕NS (Rd), we deﬁne ϕ(f) and Djϕ (j =
1, . . . , d) by
ϕ(f) :=
N

r=1
ϕr(fr),
Djϕ = (Djϕr)N
r=1.
A sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld on M4
is deﬁned as a
four-component sharp-time quantum ﬁeld (ψr(t, ·))4
r=1 on R3 (t ∈R) acting
in a Hilbert space F (see Section 8.3.3) such that the following (D.1) and
(D.2) hold:
(D.1) For all f ∈⊕4S (R3), the operator
ψ(t, f) :=

equation
(12.8)
in
the

of
a
operator-valued distribution: for all Ψ ∈D (a common domain of
ψr(t, ·)) and f ∈S (R3), ψr(t, f)Ψ (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) is strongly diﬀer-
entiable in t ∈R, and
idψ(t, f)Ψ

= −i(α · Dψ)(t, f)Ψ + M(βψ)(t, f)Ψ,

with dψr(t, fr)Ψ/dt being the strong derivative of ψr(t, fr)Ψ in t,
and, for a 4 × 4 matrix T = (Trr′)r,r′=1,2,3,4,
(T ψ)r(t, g) :=
4

r′=1
Trr′ψr′(t, g),
g ∈S (R3).

(D.2) Let πr(t, f) := iψr(t, f)∗, t ∈R, f ∈S (R3) (see (12.51)). Then,
ψr(t, f) and πr(t, f) satisfy the equal-time CAR:
{ψr(t, x), πr′(t, x′)∗} = iδrr′δ(x −x′),
{ψr(t, x), ψr′(t, x′)} = 0, {πr(t, x), πr′(t, x′)} = 0,
r, r′ = 1, 2, 3, 4, x, x′ ∈R3,
where ψr(t, x) and πr(t, x) denote the operator-valued distri-
bution
kernel of
ψ(t, ·)
and πr(t, ·),
respectively: ψr(t, f)

Heuristic arguments
If one replaces the functions bcl
+(k, s) (resp., bcl
−(−k, s)) in the classical free
Dirac ﬁeld ψcl(t, x), given by (12.106), with an operator-valued distribution
kernel b(k, s) (resp., d(k, s)∗) satisfying the anti-commutation relations
{b(k, s), b(k′, s′)∗} = δss′δ(k −k′),
(12.110)
{d(k, s), d(k′, s′)∗} = δss′δ(k −k′),
(12.111)
{b(k, s), b(k′, s′)} = {d(k, s), d(k′, s′)} = 0,
(12.112)
{b(k, s), d(k′, s′)} = {b(k, s), d(k′, s′)∗} = 0,
(12.113)
in the sense of operator-valued distributions (k, k′ ∈R3, s, s′ = ±1/2),
then one has heuristically an object
ψ(t, x) :=

s=±1/2

(12.114)
which may be expected to be the operator-valued distribution kernel of
a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. Indeed, it is easily seen that ψ(t, x) formally
satisﬁes the above properties (D.1) and (D.2). With this scheme of heuris-
tics, we show in the following that there certainly exists an operator-valued
distribution whose kernel has the form ψ(t, x) given by (12.114).
12.3.3
Rigorous construction
By the heuristic arguments in the preceding section, we need only to
show that there exist operator-valued distributions b(·, s) and d(·, s) with
Free Quantum Dirac Field
809
properties (12.110)–(12.113). For this purpose, we apply the theory of
fermion Fock spaces developed in Chapter 6.
We take the Hilbert space
ˆ
HD := L2(R3
k; C4)
(12.115)
as the one-fermion space and consider the fermion Fock space
FD := Ff( ˆ
HD)
(12.116)
over
ˆ
HD.
We denote by B(f) (f = (f1, f2, f3, f4) ∈
ˆ
HD) the fermion annihilation
operator on FD and, for each f ∈L2(R3
k) and s = ±1/2, we deﬁne bounded
linear operators b(f, s) and d(f, s) on FD as follows:
b(f, 1/2) = B(f, 0, 0, 0),
b(f, −1/2) = B(0, f, 0, 0),
(12.117)
d(f, 1/2) = B(0, 0, f, 0),
d(f, −1/2) = B(0, 0, 0, f).
(12.118)
The CAR of B(·) and B(·)∗(see Theorem 6.13) imply that, for all f, g ∈
L2(R3
k) and s, s′ = ±1/2,
{b(f, s), b(g, s′)∗} = δss′ ⟨f, g⟩,
(12.119)
{d(f, s), d(g, s′)∗} = δss′ ⟨f, g⟩,
(12.120)
{b(f, s), b(g, s′)} = {d(f, s), d(g, s′)} = 0,
(12.121)
{b(f, s), d(g, s′)} = {b(f, s), d(g, s′)∗} = 0.
(12.122)
In particular, we have
∥b(f, s)#∥= ∥d(f, s)#∥= ∥f∥,
f ∈L2(R3
k).
Hence, the mapping S (R3
k) ∋f 	→b(f ∗, s) (resp., b(f, s)∗, d(f ∗, s),
d(f, s)∗) is an operator-valued distribution on R3. We denote the operator-
valued distribution kernels of b(f ∗, s) and d(f ∗, s) by b(k, s) and d(k, s),
respectively:
b(f, s) =

R3 b(k, s)f(k)∗dk,
d(f, s) =

R3 d(k, s)f(k)∗dk.
(12.123)
Corresponding to
these
expressions, we denote
the
operator-valued
distribution kernels of b(f, s)∗and d(f, s)∗by b(k, s)∗and d(k, s)∗,
respectively. Then, it is easy to see that (12.119)–(12.122) imply (12.110)–
(12.113).
810
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Note that, for each helicity s, two kinds of annihilation operator b(·, s)
and d(·, s) appear. Physically, b(·, s) (resp., b(·, s)∗) is the annihilation
(resp., creation) operator of a Dirac particle with helicity s and d(·, s)
(resp., d(·, s)∗) is the annihilation (resp., creation) operator of an anti-
Dirac particle with helicity s (see Section 12.5 for a justiﬁcation of this
interpretation).
Since ∥u(k, s)∥C4 = 1 and ∥v(k, s)∥C4 = 1 for all k ∈R3 and s = ±1/2,
it follows that
|ur(k, s)| ≤1,
|vr(k, s)| ≤1,
k ∈R3, s = ±1/2, r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
Hence, for all f ∈L2(R3
k),
ur(·, s)f, vr(·, s)f ∈L2(R3
k),
r = 1, 2, 3, 4, s = ±1/2.
Therefore, for each f ∈L2(R3
k) and t ∈R, one can deﬁne a bounded linear
operator ψr(t, f) on FD (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) by
ψr(t, f) :=

s=±1/2
 
b(eiEtur(·, s)∗!
f ∗, s) + d(eiEtvr(·, s) f, s)∗"
,
(12.124)
where ˆf is the three-dimensional Fourier transform of f and
vr(k, s) := vr(−k, s),
k ∈R3, s = ±1/2.
This is obtained by smearing ψr(t, x) given by (12.114) with f.
The operator
ψ(t, f) :=
4

r=1
ψr(t, fr),
f ∈⊕4L2(R3).
(12.125)
is a candidate for a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld.
We ﬁrst check if ψ(t, f) obeys the free Dirac equation (12.109).
Theorem 12.7. Let f ∈S (R3). The, for all n ∈N, the operator-valued
function ψr(t, f) (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) is n times uniformly diﬀerentiable in t ∈R.
Moreover, for all f ∈⊕4S (R3),
idψ(t, f)
dt
= −i(α · Dψ)(t, f) + M(βψ)(t, f),
t ∈R,
(12.126)
where dψ(t, f)/dt is the uniform derivative of ψ(t, f) in t.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
811
Proof. It is easy to see that, for all n ∈N, ur(·, s)∗!
f ∗and vr(·, s) ˆf are in
D(En). Hence, by Theorem 6.20, ψr(t, f) is n times uniformly diﬀerentiable
in t ∈R. In particular,
idψr(t, f)
dt
=

s=±1/2
 
b(eiEtEur(·, s)∗!

.
Hence,
idψ(t, f)
dt
=

s=±1/2
 
b(eiEtFs, s) + d(eiEtGs, s)∗"
,
where
Fs(k) := E(k)
#
u(k, s), !
f ∗(k)
$
C4 , Gs(k) := −E(k)
#
ˆf(k)∗, v(k, s)
$
C4.
We have, for all k ∈R3,
ˆhD(k)u(k, s) = E(k)u(k, s),
ˆhD(−k)v(k, s) = −E(k)v(k, s),
where we have used the fact that E(k) = E(−k). Using these relations and
the Hermiteness of ˆhD(k), we have
Fs(k) =
#
u(k, s), ˆhD(k)!
f ∗(k)
$
C4,
Gs(k) =
#
ˆhD(−k) f(k)∗, v(k, s)
$
C4.
Using (12.79), we see that
ˆhD(k)!
f ∗(k) =

(thDf)∗(k),
ˆhD(−k) f(k)∗= (
thDf)(k)∗,
where thD := i 3
j=1
tαjDj + M tβ. Hence,
idψ(t, f)
dt
= ψ(t, thDf).
This is equivalent to (12.126).
□
We next compute the anti-commutation relations of the operators
ψr(t, f), r = 1, 2, 3, 4, t ∈R, f ∈L2(R3):
Theorem 12.8. Let f, g ∈L2(R3), t, t′ ∈R and r, r′ = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then,

Proof. By anti-commutation relations (12.119), (12.120) and (12.122), we
have
{ψr(t, f), ψr′(t′, g)∗}

follows from (12.121) and (12.122).

As a corollary to Theorem 12.8, we obtain the equal-time anti-
commutation relations.
Corollary 12.3. Let f, g ∈L2(R3), t ∈R and r, r′ = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then,
{ψr(t, f), ψr′(t, g)∗} = δrr′ ⟨g, f⟩,
(12.129)
{ψr(t, f), ψr′(t, g)} = 0,
{ψr(t, f)∗, ψr′(t, g)∗} = 0.
(12.130)
Proof. Formula (12.129) follows from (12.127) and (12.105), while (12.130)
is just a special case of (12.128).
□
Corollary 12.4. For all f ∈L2(R3), t ∈R and r = 1, 2, 3, 4,
∥ψr(t, f)#∥≤∥f∥.
(12.131)
Proof. By (12.129), we have for all Ψ ∈FD,
∥ψr(t, f)Ψ∥2 + ∥ψr(t, f)∗Ψ∥2 = ∥f∥2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence, ∥ψr(t, f)#Ψ∥≤∥f∥∥Ψ∥. Hence, (12.131) follows.
□
By Theorem 12.7 and Corollary 12.3, we can conclude that ψ(t, f) (f ∈
⊕4S (R3)) is a sharp-time free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of mass M.
Let
ψD(t, f) := ψ(t, f ∗),
f ∈⊕4S (R3).
Then, ψD(t, f) is anti-linear in f.

Theorem 12.9. For each t ∈R,
πt := (FD, {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)})
(12.132)
is an irreducible representation of the CAR over ⊕4S (R3).
Proof. Corollary 12.3 implies that {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}
obeys the CAR over ⊕4S (R3).
We next prove the irreducibility of {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}.
Let T ∈{ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}′. For each ˆf ∈C∞
0 (R3
k \ {0}),
we deﬁne

3

f (−)
s
:= F −1
3
v(·, s)ˆf,
s = ±1
2.
By Remark 12.8, f (±)
s
are in ⊕4S (R3), for all M ≥0. By (12.125) and
(12.124), we have
ψD(t, f (+)
1/2 ) = B(eiEt ˆf, 0, 0, 0),
ψD(t, f (+)
−1/2) = B(0, eiEt ˆf, 0, 0),
ψD(t, f (−)
1/2 ) = B(0, 0, eiEt( ˆf)∗, 0)∗,
ψD(t, f (−)
−1/2) = B(0, 0, 0, eiEt( ˆf)∗)∗.
Hence, introducing Dt := {eiEt ˆf| ˆf
∈C∞
0 (Rk \ {0})}, one has that
T ∈{B(F), B(F)∗|F ∈⊕4Dt}′. It is easy to see that ⊕4Dt is dense in
in
ˆ
HD. Therefore, by Theorem 6.22, T = αI, for some α ∈C. Thus,
{ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)} is irreducible.

Anti-commutation relations at diﬀerent space-time
points and microscopic causality
In this section, we derive an explicit formula for the right-hand side of
(12.127) and show that the microscopic causality holds for the free quantum
Dirac ﬁeld.
Lemma 12.14. For all k = (k1, k2, k3) ∈R3,
P+(k) = (γμkμ + M)γ0

(12.135)
P−(k) = γ0(γμkμ −M)
2E(k)

(12.136)
where k0 := E(k) and kj := −kj, j = 1, 2, 3.
Proof. The orthogonal projection onto the eigenspace U+ (resp., U−) of
β is given by (1 ± β)2. Hence, by (12.61), we have
P±(k) = UD(k)∗1 ± β

Then, using αj = γ0γj, β = γ0 and αjβ = −βαj, we obtain (12.135) and
(12.136).

Vacuum expectation values
We denote by

Hamiltonian and Momentum Operator of the Free
Quantum Dirac Field
For a linear operator A on L2(R3
k), the direct sum operator ⊕4A on
ˆ
HD
will be denoted by A simply.
The fermion second quantization of the multiplication operator E
HD := dΓf(E)
(12.145)
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on FD. It follows from Theorem 6.18
and (12.124) that
ψr(t, f) = eitHDψr(0, f)e−itHD,
f ∈L2(R3). r = 1, 2, 3, 4.
(12.146)
By Theorem 12.9 and Proposition 8.2, HD can be interpreted as the
Hamiltonian of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of mass M up to
constant additions.
818
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 12.11. Let πt be given by (12.132). Then, for each pair (t, s) ∈
R2, πt is equivalent to πs.
Proof. By (12.146), we have
ψr(t, f) = ei(t−s)HDψr(f)e−i(t−s)HD.
Hence, {ψD(t, f), ψD(t, f)∗|f
∈
⊕4S (R3)} is unitarily equivalent to
{ψD(s, f), ψD(s, f)∗|f ∈⊕4S (R3)}. Therefore, πt is equivalent to πs.
□
The fermion second quantization of the multiplication operator kj (j =
1, 2, 3)
PD,j := dΓD(kj)
(12.147)
is also self-adjoint. The triple
PD := (P 1
D, P 2
D, P 3
D)
(P j
D := −PD,j, j = 1, 2, 3)
(12.148)
is strongly commuting. It is easy to see that, for all a = (a1, a2, a3) ∈R3,
f ∈L2(R3) and r = 1, 2, 3, 4,
ψr(t, fa)
= eia1PD,1eia2PD,2eia3PD,3ψr(t, f)e−ia1PD,1e−ia2PD,2e−ia3PD,3
(12.149)
Hence, PD can be interpreted as the momentum operator of the free
quantum Dirac ﬁeld.
Remark 12.9. Let us brieﬂy look at classical–quantum correspondence in
the theory of a free Dirac ﬁeld. Let Hformal be the formal operator, which
is obtained by replacing the classical ﬁeld ψ(x) in the classical Hamiltonian
Hcl (see (12.52)) with the symbolical (heuristic) expression (12.114) of the
free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. Then, formal manipulations give
Hformal =

s=±1/2

R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) −d(k, s)d(k, s)∗},
where the manipulations have to be made without changing the order of
the creation and annihilation operators. Using the CAR for d(k, s), we have
Hformal =

s=±1/2

R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) + d(k, s)∗d(k, s)}
−2δ(0)

R3 dkE(k),
a mathematically meaningless expression since the last term is divergent.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
819
On the other hand, by applying Theorem 6.19(i), we have
HD =

s=±1/2
∞

n=1
b(en, s)∗b(Een, s) +

s=±1/2
∞

n=1
d(en, s)∗d(Een, s)
(12.150)
on ∧ﬁn(D(E)), where {en}∞
n=1 ⊂D(E) is a CONS of L2(R3). Using (12.123)
and the relation
∞

n=1
en(k)en(k′)∗= δ(k −k′)
in the sense of distribution, we obtain a symbolical expression for HD:
HD =

s=±1/2

R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) + d(k, s)∗d(k, s)}.
This is just Hformal without the divergent term −2δ(0)

R3 dkE(k). Hence,
a proper form of the Hamiltonian of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld can
be found by an “inﬁnite renormalization” of Hformal. Note that the CAR
of d(k, s)# plays an essential role in ensuring that the Hamiltonian after
the renormalization is bounded from below; if d(k, s) and d(k, s)∗obeyed
the CCR [d(k, s), d(k′, s′)∗] = δ(k −k′)δss′, then we would have H′
D :=

s=±1/2

R3 dkE(k){b(k, s)∗b(k, s) −d(k, s)∗d(k, s)} as a renormalized
Hamiltonian. It is easy to see that H′
D is a symbolical expression of a
well-deﬁned operator, i.e.,
H′
D = dΓf(E ⊕E ⊕(−E) ⊕(−E)).
But this operator is neither bounded from below nor bounded from above.
Hence, H′
D is not suitable as a Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld system which
should be bounded from below.
It turns out that, in terms of the ﬁeld ψ(x), HD is formally written as
HD =

R3 : ψ(x)∗(−iα · ∇+ βM)ψ(x) : dx,
where : · : denotes Wick product for the Dirac ﬁeld deﬁned as follows:
: A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2) := A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2),
: B(k2, s2)A(k1, s1)∗:= −A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2),
: A(k1, s1)B(k2, s2) := A(k1, s1)B(k2, s2),
: A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2)∗:= A(k1, s1)∗B(k2, s2)∗,
820
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
for A, B = b or d and : (X+Y )(X′+Y ′) :
def
= : XX′ : + : XY ′ : + : Y X′ : + :
Y Y ′ :. Hence, heuristically, the inﬁnite renormalization mentioned above
corresponds to taking the Wick product in the Hamiltonian density.
12.5
Total Charge Operator
Corresponding to the classical total charge Qcl given by (12.56), the total
charge of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld ψ(t, x) may be heuristically of the
form
Qformal = q

R3 : ψ(0, x)∗ψ(0, x) : dx
= q

s=±1/2

R3 (b(k, s)∗b(k, s) −d(k, s)∗d(k, s)) dk.
This suggests the following rigorous deﬁnition for the total charge operator
QD of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld:
QD := qdΓf(I ⊕(−I)),
(12.151)
where I ⊕(−I) is the operator on
ˆ
HD, deﬁned by
(I ⊕(−I))f = (f1, f2, −f3, −f4),
f = (fr)4
r=1 ∈HD.
It is obvious that QD is self-adjoint and strongly commutes with HD and
PD,j (j = 1, 2, 3).
Introducing operators
N+ := dΓf(I ⊕0),
N−:= dΓf(0 ⊕I),
(12.152)
we have
QD = q(N+ −N−)
(12.153)
on D(N+) ∩D(N−).
Let n, m ≥0, fj, gℓ∈L2(R3), sj, tℓ= ±1/2 (j = 1, . . . , n, ℓ= 1, . . . , m)
and
Ψ (n,m) := b(f1, s1)∗· · · b(fn, sn)∗d(g1, t1)∗· · · d(gm, tm)∗Φ0.
Then, we have
N+Ψ (n.m) = nΨ (n,m),
N−Ψ (n,m) = mΨ (n,m).
Hence,
QDΨ (n,m) = q(n −m)Ψ (n,m).
Free Quantum Dirac Field
821
Therefore, Ψ (n,m) can be interpreted as a state vector consisting of
n Dirac particles and m anti-Dirac particles (note that the charge of an
anti-Dirac particle is −q). The operator N+ (resp., N−) counts the number
of Dirac (resp., anti-Dirac) particles in the state Ψ (n,m). Hence, N+ (resp.,
N−) is called the number operator for Dirac (resp., anti-Dirac) particles.
The one-particle space
ˆ
HD = L2(R3
k; C4) has the obvious orthogonal
decomposition
ˆ
HD =
ˆ
HD+ ⊕HD−,
ˆ
HD+ := L2(R3
k; C2),
ˆ
HD−:= L2(R3
k; C2).
According to the deﬁnitions of b(·, s)# and d(·, s)#, the Hilbert space
ˆ
HD+
(resp.,
ˆ
HD−) is interpreted as the Hilbert space for one Dirac (resp., anti-
Dirac) particle in the momentum representation. According to the isomor-
phism theorem (Theorem 6.21), FD is isomorphic to Ff( ˆ
HD+)⊗Ff(HD−).
We denote this isomorphism by U. Let Nf := dΓf(I) be the fermion number
operator on Ff(L2(R3
k; C2)) and
N +
f
:= Nf ⊗I,
N −
f
:= I ⊗Nf.
(12.154)
Then,
UN±U −1 = N ±
f ,
and hence
UQDU −1 = q(N +
f −N −
f )
(12.155)
on ∧0( ˆ
HD+)ˆ⊗∧0 ( ˆ
HD−).
Note that
Ff( ˆ
HD+) ⊗Ff( ˆ
HD−) = ⊕n,m≥0Fn,m,
where
Fn,m := ∧n( ˆ
HD+) ⊗∧m( ˆ
HD−).
We have
(N +
f −N −
f )Ψ = (n −m)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fn,m.
Hence, for each z ∈Z,
Hz := U −1 (⊕n,m≥0,n−m=zFn,m)
is the eigenspace of QD with eigenvalue qz:
Hz = ker(QD −qz).
(12.156)
It follows that
FD = ⊕z∈ZHz.
(12.157)
822
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Thus, FD is decomposed into the inﬁnite direct sum of the closed subspaces
with diﬀerent charges. Since HD strongly commutes with QD, it follows
that, for all t ∈R, e−itHD leaves each Hz invariant. This is a more detailed
statement of the charge conservation law in the system of the free quantum
Dirac ﬁeld.
12.6
Poincar´e Covariance
In this section, we prove the relativistic covariance of the free quantum
Dirac ﬁeld.
Theorem 12.12. Let S(A) be as in Lemma 12.9. Then, there exists a
strongly continuous unitary representation {U(a, A)|(a, A) ∈
P↑
+} of the
group 
P↑
+ such that, for all (a, A) ∈
P↑
+ and f ∈⊕4S (R4),
U(a, A)Φ0 = Φ0
(12.158)
and
U(a, A)ψ(f)U(a, A)−1 = S(A)−1ψ(f(a,Λ(A))),
(12.159)
where f(a,Λ(A)) : = ((fr)(a,Λ(A)))4
r=1.
We prove this theorem by constructing U(a, A) explicitly. We ﬁrst
describe a basic idea for that.
Let f ∈⊕4S (R4). Then, by (12.133) and the deﬁnition of b(·)# and
d(·)#, we have
ψ(f) = B(K+f ∗) + B(K−f)∗,
(12.160)
where
K+g := (u(·, 1/2)∗FEg, u(·, −1/2)∗FEg, 0, 0),
(12.161)
K−g := (0, 0, ˜v(·, 1/2)FEg, ˜v(·, −1/2)FEg), g ∈L2(R4
x; C4).
(12.162)
For notational simplicity, we set S := S(A)−1 and Λ := Λ(A). Then,
Sψ(f(a,Λ)) = ψ(tSf(a,Λ)) = B(K+S∗f ∗
(a,Λ)) + B(K−tSf(a,Λ))∗,
(12.163)
Hence, recalling Theorem 6.17, one needs only to show that there exists a
strongly continuous unitary representation {Y (a, A)|(a, A) ∈

P↑
+} on
ˆ

+ and g ∈
ˆ
HD,
Y (a, A)K+g = K+S∗g(a,Λ),
Y (a, A)K−g = K−
tSg(a,Λ).
(12.164)
Then, U(a, A) := Γf(Y (a, A)) gives the desired unitary representation.
We now proceed to showing the existence of such an operator Y (a, A).
In what follows, S(A) is assumed to be the one given in Theorem 12.12.
Lemma 12.15. For all g ∈L2(R4
x; C4),
∥K+S∗g(a,Λ)∥2 = ∥K+g∥2,
(12.165)
∥K−tSg(a,Λ)∥2 = ∥K−g∥2.
(12.166)
Proof. By (12.103) and (12.104), we have
∥K+g∥2 =

R3 ⟨(FEg)(k), P+(k)(FEg)(k)⟩C4 dk,
∥K−g∥2 =

R3

(FEg)(k), tP−(−k)(FEg)(k)

C4 dk.
Note that, in the second equation, the transposed matrix tP−(−k) appears.
It is easy to see that
(FEg(a,Λ))(k) = ei˜ka(FEg)(kΛ),
where ˜k := (E(k), k) and kΛ := ((Λ−1˜k)1, (Λ−1˜k)2, (Λ−1˜k)3). Hence,
∥K+S∗g(a,Λ)∥2 =

R3 ⟨(FEg)(kΛ), SP+(k)S∗(FEg)(kΛ)⟩C4 dk,
(12.167)
∥K−
tSg(a,Λ)∥2 =

R3

(FEg)(kΛ), StP−(−k)tS(FEg)(kΛ)

C4 dk
=

R3

(FEg)(kΛ), t(SP−(−k)S∗)(FEg)(kΛ)

C4 dk
By (12.135) and (12.42), we have
SP+(k)S∗= (SγμS−1kμ + M)γ0
2E(k)
.
By (12.40), we have
SγμS−1kμ = Λμ
νγνkμ = (Λ−1˜k)μγμ.
824
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By this fact and the Lorentz invariance of the measure dk/E(k), we see
that the right-hand side of (12.167) is equal to

R3 ⟨(FEg)(k), P+(k)(FEg)(k)⟩C4 dk = ∥K+g∥2.
Hence, (12.165) holds.
By (12.136) and (12.42), we have
SP−(k)S∗= γ0(SγμS−1kμ −M)
2E(k)
.
Hence, in the same way as in the case of SP+(k)S∗, we have

R3

(FEg)(kΛ), t(SP−(−k)S∗)(FEg)(kΛ)

C4 dk
=

R3

(FEg)(k), tP−(−k)(FEg)(k)

C4 dk.
Thus, (12.166) is obtained.

Let
D0 := {K+g + K−f|g, f ∈⊕4S (R4
x)}.
Then, it is easy to see that D0 is a subspace of
ˆ
HD.
Lemma 12.16. The subspace D0 is dense in
ˆ
HD.
Proof. Let G
=
(Gr)4
r=1
∈
D⊥
0 . Then, for all f, g
∈
⊕4S (R4),
⟨G, (K+g + K−f)⟩= 0. In particular, considering the cases f = 0 and
g = 0, respectively, we have ⟨G, K+g⟩= 0 and ⟨G, K−f⟩= 0, respectively.
Hence,
⟨w+, FEg⟩= 0,
⟨w−, FEf⟩= 0,
where
w+ := G1u(·, 1/2) + G2u(·, −1/2),
w−:= G3˜v(·, 1/2)∗+ G4˜v(·, −1/2)∗.
In the same way as in the proof of Lemma 10.9, one can show that
{FEg|g ∈⊕4S (R4)} is dense in
ˆ
HD. Hence, w± = 0. Since, for each
k ∈R3, {u(k, s), v(k, s)|s = ±1/2} is a basis of C4, it follows that
Gr = 0, r = 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence, G = 0. Thus, D0 is dense in
ˆ
HD.
□
For each (a, A) ∈
˜
P↑
+, we deﬁne a linear operator on
ˆ
HD as follows:
D(Y (a, A)) := D0,
Y (a, A)(K+g + K−f) := K+S∗g(a,Λ) + K−tSf(a,Λ), K+g + K−f ∈D0.
Free Quantum Dirac Field
825
By Lemma 12.15, Y (a, A) is well deﬁned (i.e., if K+g + K−f = K+g′ +
K−f ′ ∈D0, then K+S∗g(a,Λ) + K−tSf(a,Λ) = K+S∗g′
(a,Λ) + K−tSf ′
(a,Λ))
and
∥Y (a, A)(K+g + K−f)∥2 = ∥K+S∗g(a,Λ)∥2 + ∥K−tSf(a,Λ)∥2
= ∥K+g∥2 + ∥K−f∥2
= ∥K+g + K−f∥2.
Hence, Y (a, A) is a densely deﬁned isometric operator. Therefore, accord-
ing to the extension theorem, Y (a, A) has a unique extension as an every-
where deﬁned isometric operator on
ˆ
HD. We denote it by the same symbol
Y (a, A).
Lemma 12.17. The mapping Y :
˜
P↑
+ ∋(a, A) 	→Y (a, A) is a strongly
continuous unitary representation of P↑
+.
Proof. For each (a, A) ∈
˜
P↑
+, we deﬁne
η(a, A)g := g(a,Λ(A)),
g ∈L2(R4; C4).
Then, it is easy to see that η(·) is a strongly continuous unitary represen-
tation of
˜
P↑
+ on L2(R4; C4). We have
Y (a, A)K+g = K+S(A−1)∗η(a, A)g, g ∈⊕4S (R4).
Hence, for all (a, A), (b, B) ∈
˜
P↑
+,
Y (a, A)Y (b, B)K+g = Y (a, A)K+S(B−1)∗η(b, B)g
= K+S(A−1)∗η(a, A)(S(B−1)∗η(b, B)g)
= K+S(A−1)∗S(B−1)∗η(a, A)η(b, B)g
= K+S((AB)−1)∗η((a, A)(b, B))g
= Y ((a, A)(b, B))K+g.
Similarly, one ca show that
Y (a, A)Y (b, B)K−f = Y ((a, A)(b, B))K−f,
f ∈L2(R3; C4).
Hence, Y (a, A)Y (b, B) = Y ((a, A)(b, B)) on D0. Since D0 is dense and Y (·)
is bounded, it follows that Y (a, A)Y (b, B) = Y ((a, A)(b, B)). In particular,
this implies that Y (a, A) is surjective. Thus, Y (a, A) is unitary. The strong
continuity of Y (a, A) in (a, A) is easily proved.
□

Lemma 12.17 shows that Y (·) is the desired representation of ˜
P↑
+. Thus,
Theorem 12.12 is proved.
Remark 12.10. Formula (12.159) is symbolically written in terms of the
operator-valued distribution kernel ψr(x) of ψr(f) (f ∈S (R4)) as follows:
U(a, A)ψr(x)U(a, A)−1 =
4

r′=1
(S(A)−1)rr′ψr′(Λ(A)x + a).
Remark 12.11. A free quantum Dirac ﬁeld can be constructed in a
manifestly covariant way. See, for example, Bogoliubov et al. (1975), Chap-
ter 2, Section 4, and Dimock (2011), Chapter 8.
12.7
The Free Quantum Dirac Field with
Momentum Cutoﬀ
As in the case of a free quantum scalar ﬁeld and the free quantum radiation
ﬁeld, one can deﬁne a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀ.
Let g be a real-valued function in L2(R3
k) and, for each x ∈R3
x, deﬁne
gx ∈L2(R3
k) by
gx(k) :=
1

(2π)3 g(k)e−ik·x,
a.e. k ∈R3
k.
For r = 1, 2, 3, 4, we deﬁne an operator-valued function ψg
r : M4 →B(FD)
by
ψg
r(t, x) :=

s=±1/2
{b(eitEur(·, s)∗gx, s) + d(eitE˜v(·, s)gx, s)∗},
(12.168)
and set
ψg(t, x) := (ψg
r(t, x))4
r=1.
(12.169)
Note that
ψg(t, x) = ψ(t, ˇgx),
(12.170)
where, for h ∈L2(R3
k), ˇh is the inverse Fourier transform of h: ˇh := F −1
3
h.
By Corollary 12.4, we have
∥ψg
r(t, x)∥≤
1

(2π)3 ∥g∥.
(12.171)
Free Quantum Dirac Field
827
Theorem 12.13. Let g ∈D(E) and x = (t, x) ∈M4. Then, ψg(x) is
uniformly diﬀerentiable in xμ (μ = 0, 1, 2, 3) and satisﬁes the Dirac equation
(iγμ∂μ −M)ψg(x) = 0.
(12.172)
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 12.7.
□
We call ψg(x) the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum
cutoﬀg.
Corollary 12.5. Let g ∈D(E) and
Jμ
g (x) := ψg(x)∗γ0γμψg(x),
x ∈M4.
Then, Jμ
g (x) is uniformly diﬀerentiable in xμ and
∂μJμ
g (x) = 0.
(12.173)
Proof. By Theorem 12.13, Jg(x) is uniformly diﬀerentiable in xμ and
∂μJμ
g (x) = (∂μψg(x)∗)γ0γμψg(x) + ψg(x)∗γ0γμ∂μψg(x).
By (12.172), we have
γμ∂μψg(x) = −iMψg(x).
Taking the adjoint of both sides and using the basic properties of γ-matrices
and γ0(γμ)∗γ0 = γμ, we obtain
∂μψg(x)∗γ0γμ = iMψg(x)∗γ0.
Hence, (12.173) follows.
□
Equation (12.173) shows the conservation of the vector current Jg =
(Jμ
g )3
μ=0 of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀ.
The time-zero cutoﬀﬁeld ψg(0, x) can be used to obtain the operators
that describe the interactions of Dirac ﬁelds.
12.8
PCT Theorem
Finally, let us have a quick look at the PCT theorem in the theory of the
free quantum Dirac ﬁeld. In our formulation, the charge conjugation on
the one-particle level, which means the exchange of a particle state and
828
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
an anti-particle state, is described by the anti-unitary operator uD on
ˆ
HD,
deﬁned by
uD(f1, f2, f3, f4) := (f ∗
3 , f ∗
4 , f ∗
1 , f ∗
2 ),
(f1, f2, f3, f4) ∈
ˆ
HD.
It follows that
u2
D = I,
u−1
D = uD.
Hence, the Γ-operator
ΘD := Γf(uD)
is anti-unitary on Ff( ˆ
HD), with
Θ2
D = I.
It is easy to see that, for all f ∈L2(R3
k), s = ±1/2,
ΘDb(f, s)#Θ−1
D = d(f ∗, s)#, ΘDd(f, s)#Θ−1
D = b(f ∗, s)#.
For simplicity, we work with the standard representation of γ-matrices
(see Example 12.2). In this case, we have
β =

I2
0
0
−I2
	
αj =

0
σj
σj

Hence,
u1/2 =

I2

relates us (vs) to vs (us) by
Cus = vs,
Cvs = us,
s = ±1/2.
It is easy to see that
C∗= C,
C2 = I4,
C−1 = C.
We have
CβC−1 = −β,
CαjC−1 = αj,
j = 1, 2, 3.

829
Hence,
CUD(k)∗C−1 = UD(−k)∗,
k ∈R3.
Therefore, by (12.99), we obtain
Cu(k, s) = ˜v(k, s),
C˜v(k, s) = u(k, s).
Now, let f ∈⊕4S (R4) and ˜f(x) := f(I0Isx) = f(−x), x ∈R4. Then,
ψ(C ˜f)∗= b

Thus, we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 12.14 (PCT theorem for the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld).
For all f ∈⊕4S (R4),
ΘDψ(f)Θ−1
D = ψ(C ˜f)∗.
12.9
Notes
By Theorem 12.11, one has πt ∼= π0, for all t ∈R. The representation πt
depends on the mass M ≥0; let us write πt = π(M)
t
. Then, the following
fact is proved (Arai, 2017): if M1 ̸= M2 (M1, M2 ≥0), then π(M1)
0
is
inequivalent to π(M2)
0
. This may be the counterpart of the property of the
time-zero quantum scalar ﬁelds stated in Remark 10.1. Thus, the masses of
Dirac particles are parameters indexing a family of mutually inequivalent
irreducible representations of CAR. As in the case of the quantum scalar
ﬁeld, there is a general structure behind the fact. See Arai (2017) for the
details.

Van Hove–Miyatake Model
A model of a quantum scalar ﬁeld interacting with a ﬁxed external source is
analyzed in detail.
13.1
Introduction
We have constructed a free quantum scalar ﬁeld in Chapter 10. But this
model does not describe any interactions of elementary particles. In this
chapter, we construct a model of a quantum scalar ﬁeld interacting with a
ﬁxed external ﬁeld (source). This model is one of the simplest interacting
models in QFT, but it serves as a prototypical model in QFT in the sense
that it exhibits interesting features of models in QFT. For a comprehen-
sive understanding of the model, we ﬁrst look at its classical ﬁeld version.
Throughout this chapter, we use the physical unit system where c = 1
and ℏ= 1.
Let ϱ be a real tempered distribution on Rd, and consider the partial
diﬀerential equation
(□+ m2)ϕ(x) = ϱ(x),
x = (t, x) ∈R × Rd,
(13.1)
for a real scalar ﬁeld ϕ : R1+d →R. Physically, the distribution ϱ is inter-
preted as a given static source or static external ﬁeld (“static” means “time
independent”) and ϕ is a scalar ﬁeld generated by ϱ obeying (13.1). The
case d = 3 is the physical case in the conventional sense.
The Lagrangian which leads to the ﬁeld equation is given by
Lcl = 1
2

Rd dx

(∂tϕ(x))2 −|∇ϕ(x)|2 −m2ϕ(x)2

+

Rd dxϱ(x)ϕ(x).
835

Hence, the classical Hamiltonian takes the form
Hcl(t) = 1
2

Rd dx

π(t, x)2 + |∇ϕ(t, x)|2 + m2ϕ(t, x)2

−

Rd dxϱ(x)ϕ(t, x),
(13.2)
where π = ∂tϕ. As is easily seen, Hcl is independent of t (Problem 2).
Namely, the total energy of the ﬁeld is conserved. Hence, Hcl is written in
terms of the time-zero ﬁelds ϕ(0, x) and π(0, x):
Hcl(t) = Hcl(0)
= 1
2

Rd dx

π(0, x)2 + |∇ϕ(0, x)|2 + m2ϕ(0, x)2

−

Rd dxϱ(x)ϕ(0, x).
(13.3)
This model describes an interaction between a classical scalar ﬁeld and
a classical source. But it has no relativistic symmetry, i.e., it is a non-
relativistic model (Problem 1).
The quantum ﬁeld theoretical version of the above classical ﬁeld model
with ϱ ̸= 0 is called the ﬁxed source model, or the van Hove–Miyatake
(vHM) model, with mass m and source ϱ van Hove (1952) and Miyatake
(1952a, 1952b) (usually, this model is called the van Hove model).
In the context of classical ﬁeld theory with d = 3, the tempered distri-
bution ϱ denotes the density of the distribution of nucleons in the space R3,
and ϕ is the ﬁeld of the nuclear force that ϱ generates. According to the
meson theory by Hideki Yukawa, the nuclear force comes from the exchange
of mesons. Hence, in quantum theory, the ﬁeld of nuclear force is described
by the quantum meson ﬁeld.
Example
13.1. Suppose
that
N
nucleons
are
ﬁxed
at
points
x1, . . . , xN ∈Rd, where xj ̸= xℓfor j ̸= ℓ. Then, the distribution den-
sity of the nucleons is given by
ϱ(p)(x) :=
N

n=1
λnδd(x −xn),
(13.4)
where each λn ∈R\{0} is a constant and δd(x) is the d-dimensional delta
distribution. This type of source is called a point source.
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
837
The point source ϱ(p) can be approximated by an extended source as
follows. Let vn be a real-valued Lebesgue integrable function on Rd such
that

Rd vn(x)dx = 1 and, for κ > 0, deﬁne
ϱv,κ(x) :=
N

n=1
λnκdvn(κ(x −xn)).
(13.5)
Then, by Example D.6 in Appendix D, we have
lim
κ→∞ϱv,κ(x) = ϱ(p)(x)
in S ′(Rd).
We refer the reader to Henley and Thirring (1962), Chapter 9, for further
physical discussions of the model.
13.2
A Realization of the vHM Model
As mentioned above, the classical Hamiltonian Hcl(t) is independent of
time t. Hence, the Hamiltonian of the corresponding quantum ﬁeld model
may be deﬁned by replacing ϕ(0, x) and π(0, x) in Hcl(0) with the time-
zero ﬁelds of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld. This is a basic idea for the
construction of the vHM model given as follows.
We take the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) over L2(Rd
k) as the Hilbert
space for the vHM model to be constructed. We assume that the real tem-
pered distribution ϱ satisﬁes the condition
ϱ ∈H−1/2
ω,R (Rd)
(13.6)
(see (10.9)) and deﬁne the Hamiltonian of the model by
Hϱ := H0 −φ0(ϱ),
(13.7)
where
H0 := Hb = dΓb(ω),
the Hamiltonian of the free neutral quantum KG ﬁeld (see Section 10.2 and
(10.14)), and φ0(·) is deﬁned by (10.15).1 As suggested above, the time-zero
1By the reality of ϱ, φ0(ϱ) is essentially self-adjoint on Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
838
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
ﬁeld and its conjugate momentum in the formulation under consideration
are taken, respectively, to be φ0(f) (f ∈SR(Rd)) and π0(f), deﬁned by
(10.16). We call (Hϱ, {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}), with ϱ ̸= 0, the concrete
vHM model based on the representation {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} of
the Heisenberg CCR over SR(Rd). We remark that the above class of ϱ
does not contain the point source ϱ(p) (Problem 3) since
ϱ(p)(k) =
1

(2π)d
N

n=1
λne−ik·xn,
k ∈Rd.
As is seen, Hϱ is an example of an operator, which is obtained by per-
turbing a boson second quantization operator by a Segal ﬁeld operator.
Hence, Hϱ has an abstract version.
Generally, in the case where a physical concrete model has an abstract
version, it is better to consider the abstract version. This approach makes it
possible to understand what are general and what are special in the model
and hence may bring a deeper and wider cognition for the model under
consideration. With this philosophy, in what follows, we deﬁne the abstract
version of the concrete vHM model and analyze it in detail. The properties
of the concrete vHM model are derived as simple applications of theorems
on the abstract vHM model.
Before giving the deﬁnition of the abstract vHM model, we ﬁrst intro-
duce a general concept of abstract Bose ﬁeld models.
13.3
Abstract Form of Bose Field Models in the Canonical
Formalism in QFT
In general, an abstract Bose ﬁeld model in the canonical formalism in
QFT is deﬁned by a triple M = (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) consisting
of a self-adjoint operator H on a Hilbert space F and a representation
(F, D, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) (on F) of the Heisenberg CCR over a real
inner product space W , with the interpretation that H is the Hamiltonian
of the model, φ(f) is the time-zero ﬁeld and π(f) is the time-zero conjugate
momentum. The time-t ﬁelds (t ∈R) are deﬁned by
φ(t, f) := eitHφ(f)e−itH,
π(t, f) := eitHπ(f)e−itH.
The model M is an abstract form of the model discussed in Section 8.6.
Remark 13.1. An abstract Fermi ﬁeld model in the canonical formalism
in QFT is deﬁned by replacing {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W } by a representation of
CAR over a complex inner product space.
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
839
There may exist many Bose ﬁeld models based on the representations of
the Heisenberg CCR over a real inner product space W . Hence, it is natural
to classify them into equivalent and inequivalent ones. For this purpose, we
introduce a concept of equivalence of Bose ﬁeld models.
Deﬁnition 13.1. Two Bose ﬁeld models M := (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W })
and M′ := (F ′, H′, {φ′(f), π′(f)|f ∈W }) are said to be equivalent if
there exist a unitary operator U : F →F ′ and a real constant E such that
UHU −1 = H′ + E (cf. Proposition 8.1) and
Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f),
Uπ(f)U −1 = π′(f),
f ∈W .
In this case, we write M ∼= M′.
Remark 13.2. It is obvious that M ∼= M and that, if M ∼= M′, then M′ ∼= M.
Moreover, it is easy to see that if three Bose ﬁeld models M1, M2 and M3
satisfy M1 ∼= M2 and M2 ∼= M3, then M1 ∼= M3. Therefore, the relation ∼=
in the set of Bose ﬁeld models is certainly an equivalence relation. Thus,
the above deﬁnition is meaningful.
As is seen, the concept of equivalence deﬁned above is stronger than
the equivalence of the two representations (F, D, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W })
and (F ′, D′, {φ′(f), π′(f)|f
∈W }) of the Heisenberg CCR over W .
Also, it should be kept in mind that only the unitary equivalence of
the Hamiltonians up to constant additions does not imply the equivalence
of the models.
A Bose ﬁeld model M = (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) is said to be regu-
lar if H is bounded from below and has a unique ground state Ω (∥Ω∥= 1)
with property Ω ∈∩∞
n=1 ∩(t1,f1),...,(tn,fn)∈R×W D(X(t1, f1) · · · X(tn, fn)),
where X = φ or π.
Proposition 13.1. Let M = (F, H, {φ(f), π(f)|f ∈W }) and M′ =
(F ′, H′, {φ′(f), π′(f)|f
∈W }) be regular Bose ﬁeld models. Suppose
that they are equivalent. Then, for all n ∈N and (tj, fj) ∈R × W
(j = 1, . . . , n),
⟨Ω, X(t1, f1) · · · X(tn, fn)Ω⟩= ⟨Ω′, X′(t1, f1) · · · X′(tn, fn)Ω′⟩,
(13.8)
where Ω′ is a ground state of the model M′, with ∥Ω′∥= 1.
840
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Under the present assumption, there exist a unitary operator U :
F →F ′ and a real constant E such that UHU −1 = H′ + E · · · (∗) and
Uφ(f)U −1 = φ′(f), Uπ(f)U −1 = π′(f),
f ∈W .
By (∗), E0(H) = E0(H′) + E (recall that E0(A) := inf σ(A) for a self-
adjoint operator A). Since H′Ω′ = E0(H′)Ω′, it follows that HU −1Ω′ =
E0(H)U −1Ω′. Hence, U −1Ω′ is a ground state of H. Hence, U −1Ω′ = αΩ,
for some α ∈C with |α| = 1.
Now, let L be the left-hand side of (13.8). Then,
L =
	
U −1Ω′, X(t1, f1) · · · X(tn, fn)U −1Ω′
=
	
Ω′, (Ueit1HU −1)(UX(f1)U −1)(Uei(t2−t1)HU −1)(UX(f2)U −1) · · ·
× (Uei(tn−tn−1)HU −1)(UX(fn)U −1)(Ue−itnHU −1)Ω′
.
We have UeisHU −1 = eis(H′+E) (s ∈R) and UX(fj)U −1 = X′(fj). Hence,
L is equal to the right-hand side of (13.8).
□
Proposition 13.1 gives a suﬃcient condition for two regular Bose ﬁeld
models to be inequivalent.
Corollary 13.1. Let M and M′ be regular Bose ﬁeld models. Suppose that
there exist an n ∈N and (t1, f1), . . . , (tn, fn) ∈R×W such that (13.8) does
not hold. Then, M is inequivalent to M′.
13.4
Deﬁnition of the Abstract vHM Model
Let H be a complex Hilbert space and Fb(H ) be the boson Fock space
over H (see Chapter 5). We carry over the notation in Chapter 5.
Let T be a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on H and,
for each g ∈H \{0}, deﬁne
HT (g) := dΓb(T ) + ΦS(g).
(13.9)
This is an abstract version of Hϱ (the case of HT (g) with H = L2(Rd
k),
T = ω and g = −ϱ/√ω gives Hϱ).
From a perturbation theoretical point of view (see Remark 7.11), HT (g)
is viewed as the perturbation of dΓb(T ) by ΦS(g), and it may be better to
introduce a perturbation parameter λ ∈R by replacing g with λg so
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
841
that HT (g) takes the form
H(λ) := HT (λg) = dΓb(T ) + λΦS(g).
(13.10)
The parameter λ is also called the coupling constant. The reader should
keep in mind this point of view in what follows, although the presentation
is non-perturbative in the sense that no restriction is given to the strength
|λ| of the coupling parameter (in the standard perturbation theory, it is
usual that |λ| must be suﬃciently small).
It is easy to see that HT (g) is a symmetric operator, with D(HT (g)) ⊃
Fb,ﬁn(D(T )). From a quantum theoretical point of view, it should be exam-
ined if HT (g) is self-adjoint or essentially self-adjoint. We ﬁrst consider this
problem.
Lemma 13.1. Let K be a Hilbert space, A be a non-negative self-adjoint
operator on K and B be a symmetric operator on K such that D(A1/2) ⊂
D(B) and, for all Ψ ∈D(A1/2),
∥BΨ∥≤c∥A1/2Ψ∥+ d∥Ψ∥,
where c ≥0 and d ≥0 are constants. Then:
(i) A + B is self-adjoint with D(A + B) = D(A), bounded from below and
essentially self-adjoint on any core of A.
(ii) For all Ψ ∈D(A) and ε ∈(0, 1),
∥AΨ∥≤
1
1 −ε∥(A + B)Ψ∥+
1
1 −ε
 c2
4ε + d

∥Ψ∥.
(13.11)
(iii) Let M be a real constant such that A + B + M ≥0. Then, for all
Ψ ∈D((A + B + M)1/2) and ε ∈(0, 1), it holds that Ψ ∈D(A1/2) and
∥A1/2Ψ∥2 ≤
1
1 −ε∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2
+
1
1 −ε
 c2
4ε + d −M

∥Ψ∥2.
(13.12)
(iv) D(A1/2) = D((A + B + M)1/2).
Proof. (i) Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then, by the Schwarz inequality, we have
∥A1/2Ψ∥≤∥Ψ∥1/2∥AΨ∥1/2.
842
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Using the inequality (5.87), we have for any ε > 0,
c∥A1/2Ψ∥≤ε∥AΨ∥+ c2
4ε∥Ψ∥.
Hence,
∥BΨ∥≤ε∥AΨ∥+
 c2
4ε + d

∥Ψ∥.
Let 0 < ε < 1. Then, we can apply the Kato–Rellich theorem (Theorem
1.17) to conclude that A + B is self-adjoint with D(A + B) = D(A),
bounded from below and essentially self-adjoint on any core of A.
(ii) Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then,
∥AΨ∥≤∥(A + B)Ψ∥+ ∥BΨ∥
≤∥(A + B)Ψ∥+ ε∥AΨ∥+
 c2
4ε + d

∥Ψ∥.
Hence, (13.11) follows.
(iii) Let Ψ ∈D(A). Then,
∥A1/2Ψ∥2 = ⟨Ψ, (A + B + M)Ψ⟩−⟨Ψ, BΨ⟩−M∥Ψ∥2
≤∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥Ψ∥∥BΨ∥−M∥Ψ∥2
≤∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 + ∥Ψ∥(c∥A1/2Ψ∥+ d∥Ψ∥) −M∥Ψ∥2
≤∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 + ε∥A1/2Ψ∥2 +
 c2
4ε + d −M

∥Ψ∥2.
Hence, (13.12) with Ψ ∈D(A) holds. Since D(A) = D(A+ B + M) is a core
of (A + B + M)1/2, (13.12) with Ψ ∈D((A + B + M)1/2) follows from a
limiting argument.
(iv) It follows from (iii) that D((A + B + M)1/2) ⊂D(A1/2). On the
other hand, for all Ψ ∈D(A),
∥(A + B + M)1/2Ψ∥2 = ⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩+ ⟨Ψ, BΨ⟩+ M∥Ψ∥2
≤∥A1/2Ψ∥2 + (c∥A1/2Ψ∥+ d∥Ψ∥)∥Ψ∥+ M∥Ψ∥2
≤(1 + ε)∥A1/2Ψ∥2 +
 c2
4ε + d + M

∥Ψ∥2,
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
843
where ε > 0 is arbitrary. Since D(A) is a core of A1/2, the above inequality
extends to all Ψ ∈D(A1/2) through a limiting argument, implying that
D(A1/2) ⊂D((A + B + M)1/2).
□
In what follows, we assume the following:
g ∈D(T −1/2).
(13.13)
Theorem
13.1. Assume
(13.13).
Then,
HT (g)
is
self-adjoint
with
D(HT (g)) = D(dΓb(T )) and bounded from below. Moreover, any core of
dΓb(T ) is a core of HT (g) and, for all M ∈R such that HT (g) + M ≥0,
D((HT (g) + M)1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2).
Proof. By
Proposition
5.16,
D(dΓb(T )1/2)
⊂
D(ΦS(g)).
Hence,
D(HT (g)) = D(dΓb(T )). Moreover, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2),
∥ΦS(g)Ψ∥≤
√
2∥T −1/2g∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥+ ∥g∥
√
2 ∥Ψ∥.
(13.14)
Hence, we can apply Lemma 13.1 to the case where A = dΓb(T ) and
B = ΦS(g) to obtain the desired results.
□
By Theorem 13.1, the lowest energy
ET (g) := E0(HT (g)) = inf σ(HT (g))
(13.15)
is ﬁnite. Hence,
HT (g) := HT (g) −ET (g)
(13.16)
is a non-negative self-adjoint operator. By Theorem 13.1, one has
D( HT (g)1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2).
In what follows, we assume that there exists a conjugation C on H
such that
CT ⊂T C.
(13.17)
Let HC, φF(f) and πF(f) (f ∈HC) be as in Section 5.13. Then, by The-
orem 5.28, {φF(f), πF(f)|f ∈HC} is an irreducible representation (on
Fb(H )) of the Heisenberg CCR over HC. For each real number s ≥0,
we deﬁne
Ds(T ) := D(T −s) ∩D(T s) ∩HC,
which is dense in HC.
844
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Lemma 13.2. For each s ≥0, {eiφF(T −sf), eiπF(T sf) | f ∈Ds(T )} is
an irreducible Weyl representation over Ds(T ). In particular, {φF(T −sf),
πF(T sf) | f ∈Ds(T )} is an irreducible representation of the Heisenberg
CCR over Ds(T ).
Proof. Apply Theorem 5.47 with T replaced by T s.
□
By Theorem 13.1 and Lemma 13.2, for each g ∈D(T −1/2), we can
deﬁne a Bose ﬁeld model by the triple (Fb(H ), HT (g), {φF(T −1/2f),
πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈D1/2(T )}). We call the model with g ̸= 0 the abstract
vHM model with the pair (T, g).
If g = 0, then HT (g) = dΓb(T ). We call the triple (Fb(H ), dΓb(T ),
{φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f) |f ∈D1/2(T )}) the abstract free Bose ﬁeld
theory with one-particle Hamiltonian T (see (5.14)).
The following theorem shows that the abstract vHM model is non-
trivial.
Theorem 13.2. The abstract vHM model with the pair (T, g) is inequiva-
lent to the abstract free Bose ﬁeld theory (Fb(H ), dΓb(T ), {φF(T −1/2f),
πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈D1/2(T )}).
Proof. Suppose that they were equivalent. Then, there exist a unitary
operator U on Fb(H ) and a real constant E such that UHT (g)U −1 =
dΓb(T ) + E and, for all f ∈D1/2(T ),
UφF(T −1/2f)U −1 = φF(T −1/2f),
UπF(T 1/2f)U −1 = πF(T 1/2f).
The last two operator equations imply that, for all f ∈D1/2(T ),
UφF(T −1/2f) ⊂φF(T −1/2f)U,
UπF(T 1/2f) ⊂πF(T 1/2f)U.
Hence, by Lemma 13.2, U = cI for some c ∈C. Hence, HT (g) = dΓb(T )+E,
implying that ΦS(g) = E. But, since g ̸= 0, ΦS(g) is not a scalar operator.
Thus, we arrive at a contradiction.
□
In fact, the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to any free Bose ﬁeld
theory under suitable conditions. We prove this later (see Theorem 13.13).

The Heisenberg Fields
The Heisenberg operators of φF(T −1/2f) and πF(T 1/2f) with respect to
HT (g) (see Section 5.17) are deﬁned by
Φ(t, f) := eitHT (g)φF(T −1/2f)e−itHT (g),
(13.18)
Π(t, f) := eitHT (g)πF(T 1/2f)e−itHT (g),
t ∈R, f ∈D1/2(T ).
(13.19)
We call Φ(t, f) the Heisenberg ﬁeld of the abstract vHM model and
Π(t, f) its conjugate ﬁeld. Let us derive the diﬀerential equations they
obey. For this purpose, we prove a general fact about the strong diﬀeren-
tiability of Heisenberg operators in t.
Lemma 13.3. Let K be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator
on K . Let A be a linear operator on K satisfying the following (i)–(iii):
(i) For some constant α > 0, D(|H|α) ⊂D(A) and, for all Ψ ∈D(|H|α),
∥AΨ∥≤c∥|H|αΨ∥+ d∥Ψ∥,
where c and d are non-negative constants.
(ii) AD(|H|α+1) ⊂D(H).
(iii) There exists a subspace D ⊂D(|H|α+1) such that, for all t ∈R,
Ae−itHD ⊂D(H).
Let
A(t) := eitHAe−itH,
t ∈R,
the Heisenberg operator of A with respect to H. Then, for all Ψ ∈D, A(t)Ψ
is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and
d
dtA(t)Ψ = ieitH[H, A]e−itHΨ.
(13.20)
Remark 13.3. Using functional calculus, we have that, for all β > 0 and
t ∈R, e−itHD(|H|β) = D(|H|β). Hence, the right-hand side of (13.20)
is well deﬁned. Equation (13.20) is written in the form of a Heisenberg
equation:
d
dtA(t)Ψ = i[H, A(t)]Ψ.
Hence, the assumption of Lemma 13.3 gives a suﬃcient condition for A(t)
to satisfy the Heisenberg equation with respect to H.

We estimate each term on the right-hand side.
It follows from functional calculus that, for any Borel measurable
function f on Rd and β > 0,
|H|βf(H)Ψ = f(H)|H|βΨ,
Ψ ∈D(|H|βf(H)) ∩D(f(H)|H|β).
Using this fact and condition (i), we have

e−itHΨ = 0.
Similarly, one can show that the third term on the right-hand side
of (13.21) tends to 0 as s →0. The second term on the right-hand side of
(13.21) converges to −ieitHAHe−itHΨ as s →0. Thus, the desired result
follows.

2. Hence, part (i)
follows from (iii) in Lemma 13.1.
Concerning part (ii), we proceed as follows. For notational simplicity,
we set H := HT (g) and H0 := dΓb(T ). Let f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2) and
Ψ ∈D(H3/2). Then, D(H) = D(H0) ⊂D(A(f)#). Using Theorem 5.18(i),
we see that, for all η ∈D(H),
⟨Hη, A(f)Ψ⟩= ⟨A(f)∗η, HΨ⟩−⟨η, A(T f)Ψ⟩
+ ⟨ΦS(g)η, A(f)Ψ⟩−⟨A(f)∗η, ΦS(g)Ψ⟩.
Since A(f)Ψ and ΦS(g)Ψ are in D(H0), we have

Also, note that HΨ ∈D(H1/2) = D(H1/2

The ﬁeld equations for (Φ(t, f), Π(t, f)) are given in the following
theorem.
Theorem 13.3. Let f ∈HC ∩D(T 3/2) ∩D(T −1/2). Then, for any Ψ ∈

Proof. Throughout the proof, we set H := HT (g). By (13.22) and the

constants c1 and c2 such that
∥ΦS(f)Ψ∥≤c1∥H1/2Ψ∥+ c2∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H1/2), f ∈D(T −1/2).
By this fact and Lemma 13.4, we can apply Lemma 13.3 to the case where
A = ΦS(T −1/2f), α = 1/2 and D = D(H3/2). Hence, for all Ψ ∈D(H3/2),
Φ(t, f)Ψ is strongly diﬀerentiable in t and, by Lemma 13.4(iv),

Spectral Properties of HT (g) (I): The Case g ∈D(T −1)
As we see in the following, the spectral properties of HT (g) depend on the
regularity of g with respect to T (i.e., the property of which D(T α) (α ∈R)
the vector g belongs to). We ﬁrst discuss the case where g ∈D(T −1). A
basic idea to analyze the spectral properties of HT (g) is to perform a unitary
transformation of HT (g) to bring it to a simpler form.
Lemma 13.5. Let f ∈D(T ). Then, the operator equality
eiΦS(if)dΓb(T )e−iΦS(if) = HT (T f) + 1
2 ⟨f, T f⟩
(13.25)
holds. In particular,
eiΦS(if)Nbe−iΦS(if) = Nb + ΦS(f) + ∥f∥2

,
f ∈H ,
(13.26)
where Nb is the boson number operator on Fb(H ).
Remark 13.5. Using functional calculus, condition f ∈D(T ) implies that
T f ∈D(T −1/2). Hence, by Theorem 13.1, HT (T f) (the case g = T f) is
self-adjoint on D(dΓb(T )) and essentially self-adjoint on any core of dΓb(T ).

Since Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )), it follows that, for all n ∈N, ΦS(if)nΨ ∈
D(dΓb(T )). To show that e−iΦS(if)Ψ
is in D(dΓb(T )), we estimate
∥dΓb(T )ΦS(if)nΨ∥.
We note that, for all elements A, B in an algebra, the following identities
hold:
ABn = [A, B]Bn−1 + B[A, B]Bn−2 + · · ·

By Theorem 5.18(ii), we have
[dΓb(T ), ΦS(if)]Ψ = iΦS(T f)Ψ.
(13.28)
Hence, by applying (13.27) to the case where A = dΓb(T ) and B = ΦS(if),
we obtain
dΓb(T )ΦS(if)nΨ =
n−1

ad2(ΦS(if))dΓb(T )Ψ = −⟨f, T f⟩Ψ,

Since D(T ) is a core of T , Fb,ﬁn(D(T )) is a core of dΓb(T ). Hence, by

(13.29) implies operator equality (13.25). Taking T = I in (13.25), we obtain

σp(HT (g)) = σp(dΓb(T )) + E(T, g),
(13.34)
where, for a subset D ⊂R and a ∈R, D + a := {x + a|x ∈D}.
Moreover, for each eigenvalue E ∈σp(dΓb(T )), the multiplicity of E
is the same as that of E + E(T, g) ∈σp(HT (g)).
(iii) If σp(T ) = ∅, then
σp(HT (g)) = {E(T, g)}.
(iv) (existence and uniqueness of ground states) The Hamiltonian HT (g)
has a unique ground state given by
ΩT (g) := eiΦS(iT −1g)ΩH

up to constant multiples, where ΩH is the Fock vacuum in Fb(H ),
and
ET(g) = E(T, g).
(13.36)
Namely, ΩT (g) ∈D(HT (g)) and
HT (g)ΩT (g) = ET (g)ΩT (g).

13.7. Since
σ(dΓb(T ))
and
σp(dΓb(T ))
are
known
in
Theorem 5.3, the facts stated in Theorem 13.4(ii) completely clarify
the structure of the spectrum and the point spectrum of HT (g) with
g ∈D(T −1).
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
853
Proof. (i) By taking f = T −1g in Lemma 13.5, we obtain (13.32).
(ii) This part follows from (i) and the unitary invariance of the spectra
of a linear operator.
(iii) This follows from (13.34) and that σp(dΓb(T )) = {0} in the case
where σp(T ) = ∅(see (5.16)).
(iv) By (13.32) and the non-negativity of dΓb(T ), we have HT (g) ≥
E(T, g). Since dΓb(T )ΩH = 0, (13.32) implies (13.37) with (13.36). Hence,
ΩT (g) is a ground state of HT (g). Since ΩH is the unique ground state of
dΓb(T ) up to constant multiples, it follows that ΩT (g) is a unique ground
state of HT (g).
Formula (13.38) is due to the fact that ΩH is an entire analytic vector
for Φ(f) (f ∈H ).
□
We want to mention some remarks on Theorem 13.4 from a perturbation
theoretical point of view:
(1) We ﬁrst consider the case where T is strictly positive, i.e., T ≥m for
some constant m > 0. In this case, T −1 is a everywhere deﬁned bounded
operator with ∥T −1∥≤1/m. Hence, condition (13.31) is automati-
cally satisﬁed. By Theorem 5.3, inf σ(dΓb(T ))\{0} ≥m > 0. Hence,
0 is a simple isolated eigenvalue of dΓb(T ). As already seen, ΦS(g)
is relatively bounded with respect to dΓb(T ). Hence, one can apply
the analytic perturbation theory (Kato, 1976, Chapter 7; Reed and
Simon, 1978, Chapter XII) to the self-adjoint operator H(λ) deﬁned
by (13.10) to conclude that there exists a constant r0 > 0 such that,
for all |λ| < r0, H(λ) has a simple eigenvalue E(λ) analytic in λ with
E(0) = 0 and there exists an eigenvector Ω(λ) ∈ker(H(λ) −E(λ))
which is analytic in λ. Moreover, it is shown by an application of a gen-
eral theorem (Arai, 2006b, Theorem 5.20) that Ω(λ) is a ground state
of H(λ). Thus, in the case where T is strictly positive, the existence
of a ground state of H(λ) is shown by an application of the standard
analytic perturbation theory; however, the strength |λ| of the coupling
constant λ is restricted. Theorem 13.4(iv) shows that, in fact, H(λ) has
a unique ground state for all λ ∈R, and the ground state is analytic
in λ. We also note that ground state energy, with g replaced by λg,
is given by
ET (λg) = −λ2
2 ∥T −1/2g∥2,
which is obviously analytic in λ.
854
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(2) We next consider the case where T is not strictly positive, i.e., 0 ∈σ(T ).
In this case, 0 is not an isolated point of σ(T )2 and T −1 is unbounded
(Problem 4). Hence, it is non-trivial if g ∈D(T −1). By Theorem 5.3, in
the present case, 0 ∈σp(dΓb(T )) is not an isolated eigenvalue. Hence,
one cannot apply the standard analytic perturbation theory to H(λ) (in
the standard analytic perturbation theory, an eigenvalue of the unper-
turbed operator A in question must be an isolated eigenvalue of A
with a ﬁnite multiplicity). Theorem 13.4(iv) shows that, in this case
too, H(λ) has a ground state analytic in λ ∈R, and the ground state
energy is also analytic in λ ∈R if g ∈D(T −1).
(3) As a typical case of T in (2), let us consider the case where σ(T ) =
[0, ∞). Then, by Theorem 5.3, we have
σ(dΓb(T )) = [0, ∞).
Hence, in this case, the eigenvalue 0 of the unperturbed operator dΓb(T )
is an embedded eigenvalue of dΓb(T ). Generally, it is very subtle if an
embedded eigenvalue is stable under a perturbation. Theorem 13.4(iv)
shows that, if g ∈D(T −1), then 0 ∈σp(dΓb(T )) is stable under the
perturbation ΦS(g). But, if g ̸∈D(T −1), then it is unstable, i.e., it
disappears under the perturbation (see Theorem 13.7).
13.7
Spectral Properties of HT (g) (II): The Case g ̸∈D(T −1)
We next consider the case where (13.31) does not hold:
g ̸∈D(T −1).
(13.39)
In this case, the method of the preceding section cannot be used since
Φ(iT −1g) is not deﬁned. The spectral analysis of HT (g) under condition
(13.39) becomes more complicated as seen in the following.
We ﬁrst remark that situation (13.39) is possible only if the lowest
energy E0(T ) = inf σ(T ) of T is equal to zero:
E0(T ) = 0,
(13.40)
because, if E0(T ) > 0, then 0 ∈ϱ(T ) (recall that σ(T ) ⊂[E0(T ), ∞)), and
hence T −1 is bounded with D(T −1) = H so that g ∈D(T −1) contradicts
(13.39). Moreover, 0 is not an isolated point of σ(T ) (if 0 is an isolated
2If 0 is an isolated point of σ(T), then 0 is an eigenvalue of T, and hence T is not
injective; however, this contradicts the original assumption.

point of σ(T ), then it is an eigenvalue of T , contradicting the injectivity
of T ). Hence, inf(σ(T )\{0}) = 0.
13.7.1
Spectrum of HT (g)
The following theorem shows that the spectrum of HT (g) is itself indepen-
dent of whether g is in D(T −1) or not (cf. Theorem 13.4(ii)).
Theorem 13.5. Assume (13.13) and (13.39). Then,
σ(HT (g)) = σ(dΓb(T )) + E(T, g).
Proof. For a Borel set B, we denote the characteristic function of B by χB
and consider the operator χB(T ) deﬁned by functional calculus. It follows
that χB(T ) = ET (B), where ET is the spectral measure of T . For a > 0,
we deﬁne ga ∈H by
ga := χ[a,∞)(T )g.
(13.41)
We have

λ2 d∥ET (λ)ga∥2 =

[a,∞)
1
λ2 d∥ET (λ)g∥2 ≤1
a2 ∥ET ([a, ∞))g∥2 < ∞.
Hence,
ga ∈D(T −1).
Hence, one can apply the results in the preceding section with g replaced
by ga. Therefore, we introduce an operator
Ha := HT (ga)
(13.42)
and
Ha := Ha −E(T, ga).
(13.43)
Let
Ua := e−iΦS(iT −1ga).
Then, by Lemma 13.5, we have

For notational simplicity, we set H := HT (g) and E0 = E(T, g). Note
that
H −E0 −λ = Ha −λ + ΦS(ha) −E(T, ha),
where ha := χ[0,a)(T )g ∈D(T −1/2). Hence,
∥(H −E0 −λ)Φn,a∥≤∥( Ha −λ)Φn,a∥
+ ∥ΦS(ha)Φn,a∥+ |E(T, ha))|.
Using Theorem 5.30, we have

∥T −1/2ham∥< 1
m, ∥ham∥< 1
m, |E(T, ham)| < 1
m
By (13.45), there exists a constant nm ∈N such that
∥( Ham −λ)Φnm,am∥< 1
m.
Therefore, we obtain
∥(H −E0 −λ)Φnm,am∥≤C1
m ,
where C1 is a constant independent of m. Hence,
lim
m→∞∥(H −E0 −λ)Φnm,am∥= 0.
Therefore, λ ∈σ(H −E0). Thus,
σ(dΓb(T )) + E0 ⊂σ(H).
(13.46)
To show that the converse inclusion relation of (13.46), let λ ∈σ(H−E0).
We note that, for all Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )),
lim
a→0
HaΨ = (H −E0)Ψ.
Since D(dΓb(T )) is a common core of Ha, it follows from a general theorem
(Reed and Simon (1980), Theorem VIII.25-(a)) that Ha converges to H−E0
in the strong resolvent sense. Hence, by a general theorem again (Reed
and Simon (1980), Theorem VIII.24-(a)), there exist a real sequence {ak}k
converging to 0 and λk ∈σ( Hak) such that limk→∞λk = λ.
On the other hand, by Theorem 13.4(ii), σ( Hak) = σ(dΓb(T )). Hence,
λk ∈σ(dΓb(T )). By this fact and the closedness of σ(dΓb(T )), we conclude
that λ ∈σ(dΓb(T )). Thus, σ(dΓb(T )) + E0 ⊃σ(H).

Lemma 13.6. Let K be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator on

the following conditions:
(X.1) For each t ∈R, D(H) ⊂D(X(t)) ∩D(X(t)∗) and, for all Ψ ∈D(H),
the vector-valued functions X(t)e−itHΨ and X(t)∗Ψ are strongly con-

Proof. Let Φ(t) := e−itHΦ and Ψ(t) := e−itHΨ (t ∈R). For any s ∈R,

Lemma 13.7. Let f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )).
(i) The vector-valued function A(e−itT f)#Ψ is strongly continuous in

(ii) The vector-valued function A(e−itT f)#e−itHT (g)Ψ is strongly continu-

Theorem 5.17,
∥F(t + s) −F(t)∥≤∥T −1/2(e−isT −1)f(t)∥∥dΓb(T )1/2Ψ∥.
Using functional calculus again,
∥T −1/2(e−isT −1)f(t)∥= ∥(e−isT −1)T −1/2f(t)∥

Hence, lims→0 F(t + s) = F(t). Thus, F(t) is strongly continuous in t ∈R.
Similarly, one can prove the strong continuity of A(e−itT f)∗Ψ in t ∈R.
(ii) We set H = HT (g). Let G(t) := A(e−itT f)e−itHΨ and Ψ(t) :=

Theorem 13.6.
(i) For all t ∈R, f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D(dΓb(T )1/2),
eitHT (g)C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψ = C(eitT f)Ψ,
(13.50)
eitHT (g)C(f)∗e−itHT (g)Ψ = C(eitT f)∗Ψ.
(13.51)
(ii) Let g ∈D(T −1). Then, for all t ∈R and f ∈D(T −1/2),
C(f)ΩT (g) = 0.
(13.52)
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst consider the case where f ∈D(T ) ∩D(T −1/2). Let
Ψ, Φ ∈D(HT (g))[= D(dΓb(T ))] and
v(t) :=
	
Φ, eitHT (g)C(e−itT f)e−itHT (g)Ψ

Then, by Lemmas 5.22, 13.6, and 13.7, v(t) is diﬀerentiable:

By Theorem 5.18(i) and the CCR for A(·)#, the right-hand side is equal to
zero. Hence, v(t) = v(0) = ⟨Φ, C(f)Ψ⟩. Therefore,
eitHT (g)C(e−itT f)e−itHT (g)Ψ = C(f)Ψ.
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
861
Note that e−itT D(T −1/2) = D(T −1/2). Replacing e−itT f by f, we obtain
(13.50). Since D(T )∩D(T −1/2) is a core for T −1/2, it follows from a limiting
argument that (13.50) extends to the case f ∈D(T −1/2).
We next extend (13.50) to the case of Ψ
∈D(dΓb(T )1/2). Since
D(dΓb(T )) is a core of dΓb(T )1/2, there exists a sequence {Ψn}n in
D(dΓb(T )) such that
Ψn →Ψ,
dΓb(T )1/2Ψn →dΓb(T )1/2Ψ (n →∞).
By the preceding result, we have
C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψn = e−itHT (g)C(eitT f)Ψn.
Using Theorem 5.17, we see that {C(eitT f)Ψn}n is a Cauchy sequence. By
the closedness of C(f), limn→∞C(eitT f)Ψn = C(eitT f)Ψ. Hence,
C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψn →e−itHT (g)C(eitT f)Ψ (n →∞).
It is obvious that e−itHT (g)Ψn →e−itHT (g)Ψ (n →∞). Hence, e−itHT (g)Ψ ∈
D(C(f)) and C(f)e−itHT (g)Ψ = e−itHT (g)C(eitT f)Ψ. Thus, (13.50) holds.
Formula
(13.51)
can
be
derived
by
considering
the
adjoint
of
(13.50). In that case, note that D(|HT (g)|1/2)
=
D(dΓb(T )1/2) and
e−itHT (g)D(dΓb(T )1/2) = D(dΓb(T )1/2).
(ii) By Theorem 5.30, we have
C(f) = eiΦS(iT −1g)A(f)e−iΦS(iT −1g).
By this fact and (13.35), we obtain (13.52).
□
Theorem 13.7. Assume (13.13) and (13.39) and that T is absolutely con-
tinuous. Then, HT (g) has no eigenvectors. In particular, HT (g) has no
ground states.
Remark 13.9. This theorem shows that, under the present assumption,
the formal perturbation theory breaks down for the ground state of dΓb(T ).
Proof. We prove the theorem by reductio ad absurdum. So, suppose that
HT (g) has an eigenvalue E ∈R and ΨE = {Ψ (n)
E }∞
n=0 ̸= 0 is an eigenvector:
862
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
HT (g)ΨE = EΨE. Then, by Theorem 13.6,
eit(HT (g)−E)C(f)ΨE = C(eitT f)ΨE.
Hence,
∥C(f)ΨE∥= ∥C(eitT f)ΨE∥.
By Lemma 8.7 and Theorem C.2 in Appendix C, the right-hand side con-
verges to 0 as t →∞. Hence, C(f)ΨE = 0. This implies that
A(f)ΨE = −1

ΨE.
Under the condition ΨE ̸= 0, there exists a number n ∈N such that Ψ (n)

0. Hence, cn := ∥Ψ (n)
E ∥2 is not zero and

E ∥∥ΨE∥
≤∥f∥∥(N + 1)1/2Ψ (n)
E ∥∥ΨE∥

n + 1∥f∥∥ΨE∥.
Hence, F : D(T −1/2) →C is a continuous linear functional. Since D(T −1/2)
is dense in H , F extends uniquely to a continuous linear functional on
H . Hence, by Riesz’s representation theorem, there exists a unique vector
u ∈H such that F(f) = ⟨u, f⟩, f ∈D(T −1/2). Hence,
⟨f, u⟩= −cn
√

f ∈D(T −1/2).
This means that T −1/2g ∈D((T −1/2)∗) = D(T −1/2) — hence, g ∈
D(T −1) — and T −1g = −
√
2u/cn. But this contradicts (13.39).
□
Remark 13.10. It is well known that, even if the spectrum of a linear
operator A on a Hilbert space coincides with that of a linear operator B
on a Hilbert space, they are not necessarily unitarily equivalent. Theorems
13.7 and 13.5 imply that the pair (HT (g), dΓb(T ) + E(T, g)) is an example
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
863
of such pair (A, B) of linear operators. Note that, in this case, the absolute
continuity of T and domain property (13.39) are crucial (see the following
theorem).
Theorems 13.4 and 13.7 lead one to the following interesting fact.
Theorem 13.8. Assume (13.13) and that T is absolutely continuous. Then,
HT (g) has no ground states if and only if (13.39) holds.
We now consider the physical meaning of the absence of ground states,
as stated in Theorem 13.8. We ﬁrst remark that the property g ∈D(T α), for
some α ∈R, can be interpreted as a regularity condition for g with respect
to T . From this point of view, Theorem 13.8 shows that the existence of
ground states of HT (g) depends on the regularity of g with respect to T .
Suppose that T is absolutely continuous and E0(T ) = 0. Then, accord-
ing to the Radon–Nikod´ym theorem, there exists a non-negative integrable
function fT,g such that, for all B ∈B1,
∥ET (B)g∥2 =

B
fT,g(λ)dλ.
Hence, if g ∈D(T −s) (s > 0), then
∥T −sg∥2 =

[0,∞)
fT,g(λ)
λ2s
dλ < ∞.
It is easy to see that, for any ε > 0,

[ε,∞)
fT,g(λ)
λ2s
dλ ≤1
ε2s ∥ET ([ε, ∞))g∥2 < ∞.
Hence, g ∈D(T −1) if and only if

[0,ε)
fT,g(λ)
λ2
dλ < ∞,
for some ε > 0. Therefore, the behavior of the function fT,g(λ)/λ2 for
small λ ≈0 determines whether g ∈D(T −1) or not. In quantum physics, a
neighborhood of the zero energy of a quantum particle is called an infrared
region because it corresponds to a region of long wavelengths of the quan-
tum particle. With this picture in mind, we deﬁne a notion independently
of whether T is absolutely continuous or not.
864
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A vector f ∈H is said to be infrared regular with respect to T if
f ∈D(T −1) and infrared singular with respect to T if f ̸∈D(T −1).
Theorem 13.8 is rephrased as follows.
Assume (13.13) and that T is absolutely continuous. Then,
HT (g) has no ground states if and only if g is infrared singular
with respect to T .
As already remarked, infrared singularity with respect to T occurs only
if (13.40) holds. Generally, in a quantum ﬁeld theory with a quantum par-
ticle whose Hamiltonian T satisﬁes (13.40), there may be structures due to
infrared singularity, such as the absence of ground states. Problems related
to infrared singularity are generically called infrared problems.
Example 13.2. Consider the case where H = L2(Rd
k) and T is the mul-
tiplication operator by the function ω(k) =
√
k2 + m2, k ∈Rd (m ≥0).
Then, E0(ω) = m. Hence, the infrared singularity with respect to ω occurs
only if m = 0, i.e., the massless case. Therefore, in relativistic QFT with a
massless quantum ﬁeld, infrared problems can occur (see Theorem 13.9(iv)).
Example 13.3. Consider the case where T is the one-particle Hamiltonian
h0 of the free quantum de Broglie ﬁeld given by (9.9). Then, E0(h0) = 0.
Hence, in a quantum de Broglie ﬁeld with an interaction (e.g., the abstract
vHM model with H = L2(Rd) and T = h0), infrared problems can occur.
13.8
Application to the Concrete vHM Model
We now apply the results on the abstract vHM model established in the
preceding sections to the concrete vHM model.
Theorem 13.9. Assume (13.6) and
ϱ ∈H−1
ω,R.
(13.53)
Then:
(i) Hϱ is self-adjoint with D(Hϱ) = D(H0) and bounded from below.
(ii) Let
φϱ(t, f) := eitHϱφ0(f)e−itHϱ,

tively. Then, for all Ψ ∈D((Hϱ −E0(Hϱ))3/2) (E0(Hϱ) := inf σ(Hϱ)),
φϱ(t, f)Ψ is twice strongly diﬀerentiable in t and

(iii) Consider the case where ϱ ∈H−3/2
ω
(Rd) (i.e., ϱ/ω3/2 ∈L2(Rd)). Let
E(ϱ) := −1
2

ϱ
ω

2
and Ω0 be the Fock vacuum in Fb(L2(Rd
k)) (see (10.21)). Then, Hϱ
has a unique ground state given by
Ωϱ := e−iφ0(iϱ/ω)Ω0
(13.55)
up to constant multiples and E(ϱ) is the ground state energy of Hϱ:
HϱΩϱ = E(ϱ)Ωϱ. Moreover,
σ(Hϱ) = {E(ϱ)} ∪[E(ϱ) + m, ∞),
σp(Hϱ) = {E(ϱ)}.
(iv) Consider the case where ϱ ̸∈H−3/2
ω
. Then, m = 0 and Hϱ has no
ground states. Moreover,
σ(Hϱ) = [E(ϱ), ∞),
σp(Hϱ) = ∅.
Proof. We apply the results on the abstract vHM model to the following
case:
H = L2(Rd
k),
T = ω,
g = −ϱ
√ω .
By (13.53), condition (13.13) with g = −ϱ/√ω and T = ω is satisﬁed.
As a conjugation C satisfying (13.17) with T = ω, we take the Fourier
transform of the complex conjugation Cd on L2(Rd
x): C := FdCdF −1
d
(Cdu = u∗, u ∈L2(Rd
x)). We have
(Cf)(k) = f(−k)∗,
f ∈L2(Rd
k).
Hence, Cω ⊂ωC. Therefore, one can apply Theorem 13.1 to obtain (i).

If f ∈SR(Rd), then f/√ω ∈D(T 2) ∩D(T −1/2) with T = ω. Hence, by

ω
is
absolutely
continuous
(see
Example C.2 in Appendix C) with
σ(ω) = σac(ω) = [m, ∞),
σp(ω) = ∅.
Hence, we can apply Theorem 13.4 to obtain (iii).
Let ϱ ̸∈H−3/2
ω
(Rd). Then, ϱ/√ω ̸∈D(ω−1). Hence, as remarked at the
beginning of Section 13.7, E0(ω) = 0. Hence, by Example 13.2, m = 0. The
other statements in (iv) follow from Theorems 13.5 and 13.7.
□
Part (ii) in the above theorem shows that φϱ(t, f) is a quan-
tum ﬁeld satisfying an equation corresponding to the classical ﬁeld
equation (13.1) and πϱ(t, f) is the canonical conjugate momentum to
φϱ(t, f). In view of Theorem 13.9(iii) and (iv), the concrete vHM model

Infrared Catastrophe
We return to the abstract vHM model again. We continue to assume (13.13).
For each a > 0, we call Ha, deﬁned by (13.42), the Hamiltonian of the
abstract vHM model with infrared cutoﬀa.
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
867
By (13.44), the vector
Ωa := U −1
a ΩH
is a unique ground state of Ha up to constant multiples. As we have seen in
the proof of Theorem 13.5, Ha converges to HT (g) in the strong resolvent
sense as a →0. But, if T is absolutely continuous and g is infrared singular
with respect to T , then HT (g) has no ground states (Theorem 13.8). Then,
a natural question arises: How does Ωa behave as a →0 ? The following
theorem answers the question.
Theorem 13.10. Assume (13.13). Then, the weak limit w- lima→0 Ωa = 0
if and only if g is infrared singular with respect to T .
Proof. Let f1, . . . , fn ∈H (n ∈N) and ga be as in (13.41). Then, by
(5.204) and Theorem 5.29,
⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , Ωa⟩= (−1)n

.
(13.56)
Suppose that w−lima→0 Ωa = 0. Then, considering (13.56) with n = 0,
we have lima→0 e−∥T −1ga∥2/4 = 0. Hence,
lim
a→0 ∥T −1ga∥2 = ∞.
(13.57)
This implies that g ̸∈D(T )−1. Hence, g is infrared singular with respect
to T .
Conversely, suppose that T ̸∈D(T −1). Then, (13.57) holds. By (13.56),
we have
| ⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , Ωa⟩| ≤
1
√
2
n ∥T −1ga∥ne−∥T −1ga∥2/4

For any n ∈N, limt→∞tne−t2/4 = 0. Hence, the above estimate implies
that
lim
a→0 ⟨A(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH , Ωa⟩= 0.
Hence, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(H ), lima→0 ⟨Ψ, Ωa⟩= 0. Since Fb,ﬁn(H ) is dense
and ∥Ωa∥= 1, we can apply Proposition A.1 in Appendix A to conclude
that w−lima→0 Ωa = 0.
□

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 13.10 means the following: the ground state Ωa of Ha has
no non-trivial weak limit within the boson Fock space Fb(H ) as a →0.
This corresponds to the absence of ground states of HT (g) with g infrared
singular with respect to T . Taking the limit a →0 physically corresponds
to the removal of the infrared cutoﬀ. We remark that lima→0 T −1ga does
not exist by (13.57), but
lim
a→0 T −sga = T −sg,
s ∈[0, 1/2].
(13.58)
Let us look at the behavior of other physically interesting quantities as
a →0. Let Nb be the boson number operator on Fb(H ). Then, by (13.26),
for all a > 0, Ωa ∈D(Nb) and
⟨Ωa, NbΩa⟩= 1
2∥T −1ga∥2.
From this, we obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 13.2. Assume (13.13). Then,
lim
a→0 ⟨Ωa, NbΩa⟩= ∞.
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1).
This proposition shows that if g is infrared singular with respect to T ,
then the expectation value of the number operator Nb in the ground state
Ωa with infrared cutoﬀa diverges in the limit of removing the infrared
cutoﬀ.
To see this result in more detail, for each E > 0, we introduce an
operator NE(T ) by
NE(T ) := dΓb(χ[0,E)(T )).
This operator physically measures the number of the bosons, each of which
has an energy less than E.
Let a < E. Then, by an application of (13.25) (replace T and f by
χ[0,E)(T ) and −iT −1ga, respectively), we have
⟨Ωa, NE(T )Ωa⟩= 1
2∥T −1χ[a,E)(T )g∥2.
It is easy to see that
lim
a→0 ∥T −1χ[a,E)(T )g∥2 = ∞
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1). Thus, we obtain the following result.
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
869
Proposition 13.3. Assume (13.13) and E > 0. Then,
lim
a→0 ⟨Ωa, NE(T )Ωa⟩= ∞
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1).
On the other hand, it is easy to see that, for all E > 0,
⟨Ωa, (Nb −NE(T ))Ωa⟩= 1
2∥T −1χ[E,∞)(T )ga∥2
a→0

Thus, we see that the above divergence is caused by bosons with lower
energies (longer wave lengths). Such bosons are called soft bosons. In the
context of QFT, this kind of divergence is called an infrared divergence,
or an infrared catastrophe.
13.10
A General Structure behind the Infrared
Catastrophe
In this section, we show that the infrared catastrophe mentioned in the pre-
ceding section can be regarded as a special realization of a general structure
of the abstract vHM model. To describe it, we consider a family {g(κ)}κ>0,
with g(κ) ∈D(T −1). By Theorem 13.4(iv), HT (g(κ)) has a unique ground
state, which is given by ΩT (g(κ)) up to constant multiples. The following
theorem states a general structure of the abstract vHM model.
Theorem 13.11. The weak limit w- limκ→∞ΩT (g(κ)) = 0 if and only if
lim
κ→∞∥T −1g(κ)∥= ∞.
(13.59)
Proof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 13.10 (we need only to replace ga
by g(κ)).
□
We emphasize that, in Theorem 13.11, the existence of limκ→∞g(κ) is
not assumed.
If g ∈H is infrared singular with respect to T , then g(κ) := χ[1/κ,∞)g
satisﬁes (13.59), as already seen.
There is another important case which is related to the behavior of the
model in higher energy regions.
870
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Example 13.4. Suppose that T is unbounded and strictly positive, i.e.,
T ≥γ, for some constant γ > 0. Then, T −1 is bounded with D(T −1) = H .
Hence, g is trivially infrared regular with respect to T . Moreover, we ﬁx a
vector v ∈H such that v ̸∈D(T p), for some p ∈N. Note that χ[0,κ](T )v ∈
C∞(T ), for all κ > 0. Hence, one can deﬁne
g(κ) := T p+1χ[0,κ](T )v,
κ > 0.
Since v ̸∈D(T p), it follows that
∥T −1g(κ)∥2 =

[0,κ]
λ2pd∥ET (λ)v∥2 →∞(κ →∞).
(13.60)
Hence, by Theorem 13.11,
w- lim
κ→∞ΩT (g(κ)) = 0.
(13.61)
We note that, in this example, there are no subsequences {κn}n tending
to ∞as n →∞such that w- limn→∞g(κn) exists in H . To see this, suppose
that w- limn→∞g(κn) = g ∈H . Then, by the boundedness of T −(p+1),
w- limn→∞T −(p+1)g(κn) = T −(p+1)g. On the other hand, it follows from the
deﬁnition of g(κ) that T −(p+1)g(κn) →v (n →∞). Hence, v = T −(p+1)g.
Therefore, v ∈D(T p+1) ⊂D(T p). But this is a contradiction.
The fact just shown implies that, for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(T )), {ΦS(g(κ))Ψ}κ
has no subsequences which weakly converge. Hence, HT (g(κ))Ψ has no weak
limit as κ →∞. Thus, in this example, in contrast to the case of the
infrared catastrophe (see (13.58)), it is suggested that a Hamiltonian which
may correspond to κ = ∞cannot be deﬁned as an operator on the boson
Fock space Fb(H ).
As is seen from (13.60), the divergences related to g(κ) as κ →∞
come from higher energy regions, or, in other words, regions of shorter
wave lengths — ultraviolet regions. Hence, this kind of divergences is called
ultraviolet divergence, or ultraviolet catastrophe. The parameter κ
is called an ultraviolet cutoﬀ. Property (13.61) for the present type of
g(κ) is called the ultraviolet van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon in the
abstract sense.3
By abuse of notation, we call the property w- lima→∞Ωa = 0 the
infrared van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon in the abstract sense.
3For the concrete case, see van Hove (1952), Miyatake (1952a, 1952b), and Ezawa
(1963).

Example 13.5. In the concrete vHM model with ϱ = ϱ(p), ϱ(p)/√ω is not
in L2(Rd). In this case, one can deﬁne a source ϱκ with an ultraviolet cutoﬀ

Van Hove–Miyatake Phenomena and Inequivalent
Representations of CCR
In this section, we investigate van Hove–Miyatake phenomena from a view
point of the representation theory of CCR with inﬁnite degrees of freedom.
We freely use the mathematical terms introduced in Chapter 5.
13.11.1
The infrared case
We assume (13.13) and that T −1 is unbounded. Let C(f) (f ∈D(T −1/2))
be as in (13.49). Then, C(f) is a Bogoliubov translation (see Section 5.29.2)
with the translation functional
LT,g(f) :=
1
√
2

T −1/2g, T −1/2f

.
It follows that
πT,g := (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {C(f)|f ∈V })
is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V (see also Example 5.10).
Proposition 13.4.
(i) The representation πT,g is equivalent to the Fock representation πF(V )
(see Example 5.9) if and only if g ∈D(T −1). In that case,
C(f) = eiΦS(iT −1g)A(f)e−iΦS(iT −1g),
f ∈V ,
(13.62)
(ii) There exists a second quantization operator of T associated with πT,g,
and it is given by HT (g) −E(T, g) on Fb,ﬁn(V ).
872
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. (i) It is easy to see that there exists a vector h ∈H such that
LT,g(f) = ⟨h, f⟩, f ∈V if and only if g ∈D(T −1), and in that case,
h = T −1g/
√
2. Hence, by Theorem 5.49, πT,g is equivalent to πF(V ) if and
only if g ∈D(T −1).
Formula (13.62) follows from Theorem 5.30.
(ii) This follows from Example 5.16.
□
Proposition 13.4(i) gives a characterization of the absence of ground
states of HT (g) and the infrared van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon from a
representation theoretical point of view on CCR:
(i) Suppose that T is absolutely continuous. Then, the absence of ground
states of HT (g) exactly corresponds to the case where πT,g is inequiv-
alent to πF(V ) (see Theorem 13.8).
(ii) The infrared van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon exactly corresponds to
the case where πT,g is inequivalent to πF(V ).
The absence of ground states and the infrared van Hove–Miyatake phe-
nomenon may be singular from a conventional point of view; however, from
another point of view, they may be regarded as characteristic phenomena.
It is very interesting to know that the representation πT,g describes phys-
ically inequivalent phases depending on whether it is equivalent to πF(V )
or not.
13.11.2
The ultraviolet case
In this section, we assume that the self-adjoint operator T is strictly positive
and unbounded. Then, for all s > 0, T −s is bounded with D(T −s) = H .
Hence, one can deﬁne an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩−s : H × H →C of H by
⟨f, g⟩−s :=
	
T −sf, T −sg

H
(f, g ∈H ).
The inner product space (H , ⟨·, ·⟩−s) is not complete (Problem 5). We
denote its completion by H−s(T ).
We set H0 := H , and for s > 0, Hs(T ) := D(T s) is a Hilbert space
with inner product ⟨f, g⟩s := ⟨T sf, T sg⟩H (f, g ∈D(T s)). Thus, we have a
family {Hs(T )}s∈R of Hilbert spaces satisfying
Hs(T ) ⊂Hs′(T ),
s′ < s, s, s′ ∈R.
It is called the Hilbert scale of H with respect to T .
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
873
For all s > 0 and f ∈D(T s), g ∈H , we have, by the Schwarz inequality,
| ⟨g, f⟩H | = |
	
T −sg, T sf

H | ≤∥g∥−s∥f∥s.
Hence, the inner product ⟨·, ·⟩H is uniquely extended to the sesquilinear
form −s ⟨·, ·⟩s: H−s(T ) × Hs(T ) →C such that
|−s ⟨g, f⟩s | ≤∥g∥−s∥f∥s,
g ∈H−s(T ), f ∈Hs(T )
and
−s ⟨g, f⟩s = ⟨g, f⟩H ,
f ∈D(T s), g ∈H .
It is obvious that, for each g ∈H−s(T ), the functional φg : Hs(T ) →C,
deﬁned by
φg(f) := −s ⟨g, f⟩s ,
f ∈Hs(T ),
is a continuous linear functional, i.e., φg ∈Hs(T )∗(the dual space of
Hs(T )). It is shown that ∥φg∥= ∥g∥−s. Conversely, by using the Riesz
representation theorem, one can show that, for each φ ∈Hs(T )∗, there
exists a unique g ∈H−s(T ) such that φ = φg. The mapping H−s(T ) ∋
g →φg ∈Hs(T )∗is bijective and anti-linear. In this sense. we identify
Hs(T )∗with H−s(T ) and write g(f) for φg(f):
g(f) := −s ⟨g, f⟩s ,
g ∈H−s(T ), f ∈Hs(T ).
(13.63)
Let n ∈Z+. Then, for any φ ∈H−(n+1)(T ), there exists a sequence
{φj}j in H such that ∥φj −φ∥−(n+1) →0 (j →∞). Hence, {T −(n+1)φj}j
is a Cauchy sequence in H . Hence, {T −1φj}j is a Cauchy sequence in
H−n(T ). Therefore, there exists a unique vector fφ ∈H−n(T ) such that
∥T −1φj −fφ∥−n →0 (j →∞). Thus, the correspondence φ →fφ deﬁnes a
mapping from H−(n+1)(T ) to H−n(T ). We denote this mapping by T −1:
T −1φ := fφ.
Note that, if φ ∈H , then T −1φ = T −1φ.
Since ∥fφ∥−n = ∥φ∥−(n+1), we have
∥T −1φ∥−n = ∥φ∥−(n+1).
Hence, T −1 is an isometry from H−(n+1) to H−n. Moreover, T −1 is surjec-
tive. Thus, T −1 is a unitary operator from H−(n+1) to H−n.
874
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Now, suppose that, for some natural number p ≥1, g ∈H−(p+1)(T ).
Let
w := T −1g ∈H−p(T ).
Then, there exists a sequence {wj}j in H such that ∥wj −w∥−p →0
(j →∞). Hence, {T −pwj}j is a Cauchy sequence in H . Therefore, the
limit
ug := lim
j→∞T −pwj ∈H
exists. It is easy to see that this limit is independent of the choice of {wj}j.
Therefore, one can deﬁne a linear functional ℓg on D(T p) by
ℓg(f) :=
1
√
2 ⟨ug, T pf⟩H = lim
j→∞
1
√
2 ⟨wj, f⟩H , f ∈D(T p).
Note that, if g ∈H , then
ℓg(f) =
	
T −1g, f

,
f ∈H .
We consider the Bogoliubov translation with the translation functional
equal to ℓg:
Bg(f) := A(f) + ℓg(f)∗,
f ∈D(T p).
Let W be a dense subspace of H such that W ⊂D(T p). Then, we have an
irreducible representation
πT,g := {Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(W ), {Bg(f)|f ∈W }}
of the CCR over W .
Proposition 13.5. The representation πT,g is equivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation πF(W ) if and only if T −1g ∈H .
Proof. Suppose that πT,g is equivalent to πF(W ). Then, by Theorem 5.49,
there exists a vector h ∈H such that ℓg(f) = ⟨h, f⟩H , f ∈W . Hence,
ug ∈D(T p) and T pug =
√
2h. Therefore, ug =
√
2T −ph so that ∥wj −
√
2h∥−p →0 (j →∞). Hence, w =
√
2h. Thus, T −1g ∈H .
Conversely, suppose that w = T −1g ∈H . Then, ∥T −pwj −T −pw∥→0
(j →∞). Hence, for any f ∈D(T p), ⟨wj, f⟩= ⟨T −pwj, T pf⟩
j→∞
−→
⟨T −pw, T pf⟩= ⟨w, f⟩. Therefore, ℓg(f) =
	
w/
√
2, f

. Hence, by Theo-
rem 5.49, πT,g is equivalent to πF(W ).
□
The contraposition of Proposition 13.5 immediately gives the following
proposition.
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
875
Proposition 13.6. The representation πT,g is inequivalent to the Fock rep-
resentation πF(W ) if and only if T −1g ̸∈H .
Example 13.6. Let g(κ) ∈H (κ > 0) and (13.59) be satisﬁed. Then,
T −1g(κ) does not converge in H as κ →∞, and hence g(κ) does not either.
Assume that there exists an element g ∈H−(p+1)(T ) with some p ∈N
such that limκ→∞∥g(κ) −g∥−(p+1) = 0 and there exists no vector h ∈H
such that, for all f ∈D(T p), limκ→∞
	
T −1g(κ), f

= ⟨h, f⟩. Then, πT,g is
an inequivalent representation to the Fock representation πF(W ). This is
proved as follows.
By Theorem 5.49, the representation πT,g(κ) is equivalent to the Fock
representation πF(W ). It follows from the discussion leading to the deﬁni-
tion of ℓg(f) that, for all f ∈D(T p),
lim
κ→∞ℓg(κ)(f) = ℓg(f),
with ug := limκ→∞T −p−1g(κ). Hence,
lim
κ→∞Bg(κ)(f)Ψ = Bg(f)Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fﬁn,b(H ), f ∈D(T p).
We next show that T −1g ̸∈H . Suppose that T −1g ∈H . Then,
g ∈H−1(T ). Hence, for all f ∈D(T p),
	
T −1g(κ), f

=
	
T −(p+1)g(κ), T pf

 κ→∞
→
	
T −p T −1g, T pf

=
	 T −1g, f

.
But this contradicts the present assumption. Hence, T −1g ̸∈H . Therefore,
by Proposition 13.6, πT,g is inequivalent to the Fock representation πF(W ).
Thus, we see that the ultraviolet van Hove–Miyatake phenomenon with
additional conditions implies the inequivalence of πT,g to the Fock repre-
sentation πF(W ).
Example 13.7. Let us consider the concrete vHM model with the point
source ϱ(p), with d ≥3. Let ϱκ be as in Example 13.5. Let g(κ) := ϱκ/√ω
and g := ϱ(p)/√ω. Then, for all p > (d −3)/2, it holds that g(κ),
g ∈D(ω−(p+1)) and
lim
κ→∞∥ω−(p+1)(g(κ) −g)∥= 0.
We have, for all f ∈D(ωp),
lim
κ→∞
	
ω−1g(κ), f

ω−(p+1)g, ωpf

But g/ω ̸∈L2(Rd). Hence, there exists no vector h ∈L2(Rd
k) such that,
for all f ∈D(ωp), limκ→∞
	
ω−1g(κ), f

= ⟨h, f⟩. Thus, g(κ) and g under
consideration satisfy the conditions of (g(κ), g) in Example 13.6.

Heisenberg Field and VEVs
13.12.1
An explicit form of Heisenberg ﬁeld of the abstract
vHM model
Using Theorem 13.6, one can derive an explicit form of the Heisenberg ﬁeld
Φ(t, f) and the conjugate ﬁeld Π(t, f) (see (13.18) and (13.19)).
Let C(f) (f ∈D(T −1/2)) be deﬁned by (13.49) and
ΦT,g(f) :=
1
√
2 {C(f)∗+ C(f)} ,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
Explicitly, we have
ΦT,g(f) = ΦS(f) + RT,g(f),
where
RT,g(f) := Re
	
T −1/2f, T −1/2g

.
Hence,
φF(f) = ΦT,g(f) −RT,g(f),
(13.64)
πF(f) = ΦT,g(if) −RT,g(if),
f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩HC,
on D(A(f)) ∩D(A(f)∗). By Theorem 13.6, we have
eitHT (g)ΦT,g(f)e−itHT (g) = ΦT,g(eitT f).
Thus, we obtain the following result.
Theorem 13.12. For all t ∈R, f ∈D(T −1) ∩HC, f ′ ∈D(T 1/2) ∩HC

VEVs
The free Heisenberg ﬁeld Φfree(t, f) (f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩HC) is deﬁned by
Φfree(t, f) := eitdΓb(T )φF(T −1/2f)e−itdΓb(T ),
t ∈R.
By (5.179), we have
Φfree(t, f) = φF(eitT T −1/2f) = ΦS(eitT T −1/2f)
(13.66)
on Fb,0(H ). Hence, by (13.64) and (13.65), we have
Φ(t, f) = Φfree(t, f) + RT,g((eitT −1)T −1/2f)
on Fb,0(H ).
For (tj, fj) ∈R × (D(T −1/2) ∩HC) (j = 1, . . . , n, n ∈N), the VEVs of

orem 5.34). Here, we do not write down the explicit representation of W free

Assume (13.31). Then, by Theorem 13.4(iv), HT (g) has a unique ground
state ΩT (g). This can be regarded as a variant of the Fock vacuum ΩH
under the interaction ΦS(g) (note that ΩT (0) = ΩH ). We call the ground
state ΩT (g) the physical vacuum of the abstract vHM model to
distinguish it from the Fock vacuum.
By (13.65), the physical vacuum ΩT (g) is in the domain of the products
of any number of the Heisenberg ﬁelds. Hence, for all n ∈N and (tj, fj) ∈
R × (D(T −1) ∩HC) (j = 1, . . . , n), we can deﬁne the physical VEVs

This formula tells us that the physical VEVs of the Heisenberg ﬁelds of the
abstract vHM model can be explicitly represented in terms of VEVs in the
abstract free Bose ﬁeld theory.

Using these results, one can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 13.13. Assume that (i) g ̸∈D(T −1) and T is absolutely contin-
uous or (ii) g ∈D(T −1). Then, the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to
any free Bose ﬁeld theory.
Proof. In case (i), by Theorem 13.7, HT (g) has no ground states. Hence,
the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to any free Bose ﬁeld theory since
the latter has a ground state.
In case (ii), HT (g) has a ground state ΩT (g), as already seen. By (13.68)
and g ̸= 0, W (g)
1
̸= 0 as a function on R × D(T −1). On the other hand, in
any free Bose ﬁeld theory, the one-point VEV is zero. Hence, by Corollary
13.1, the abstract vHM model is inequivalent to Mfree.

Removal of Cutoﬀs
Suppose that there exists a natural number n0 ∈N and a net {g(κ)}κ>0
with g(κ) ∈D(T −1) such that, for all f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T n0),
ℓT,∞(f) := lim
κ→∞

T −1/2g(κ), T −1/2f

(13.69)
exists. This setting includes the removal of both infrared and ultraviolet
cutoﬀs, as the following examples show.
Example 13.8. Consider the case where g ∈D(T −1/2). For each κ > 0,
the vector g(κ) := χ[1/κ,∞)(T )g is in D(T −1). It is easy to see that
ℓT,∞(f) =

T −1/2g, T −1/2f

f ∈D(T −1/2).
If g ̸∈D(T −1), then the limit κ →∞corresponds to the removal of the
infrared cutoﬀ1/κ.
Example 13.9. Let T be a strictly positive unbounded self-adjoint oper-
ator on H and {Hs(T )}s∈R be the Hilbert scale of H with respect to T .

Suppose that, for some n0 ∈N, g ∈H−n0−1(T ). Let g(κ) ∈H be such
that limκ→∞∥g(κ) −g∥−(n0+1) = 0. Then,

Construction of the vHM Model Without Cutoﬀs
As already seen, the abstract vHM model with g ̸∈D(T −1) (g ∈D(T −1/2))
has no ground states if T is absolutely continuous, and the abstract vHM
model without ultraviolet cutoﬀs may not be deﬁned in Fb(H ) as a limit
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
881
of the abstract vHM model with ultraviolet cutoﬀs, as suggested in Exam-
ple 13.4. But Theorem 13.14 suggests the existence of the vHM model
without cutoﬀs, whose physical VEVs are equal to {W ∞
n }∞
n=0. In fact, the
existence itself follows from an application of Wightman’s reconstruction
theorem.4 But here, we give an explicit construction of the vHM model
without cutoﬀs. The idea for that is to employ (13.49) and Theorem 13.6
to deﬁne a new representation of CCR for the time-zero ﬁelds diﬀerent from
the Fock representation of CCR. This is done by replacing (HT (g), C(f))
(see (13.49)) by (dΓb(T ), A(f)) and introducing a new operator correspond-
ing to the operator A(f) in (13.49), i.e.,
B∞(f) := A(f) −1
√
2
ℓT,∞(f)∗,
f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T n0),
where ℓT,∞(f) is deﬁned by (13.69). Note that the sign in front of
ℓT,∞(f)∗/
√
2 in the above deﬁnition is minus.
We ﬁx a dense subspace V ⊂D(T −1) ∩D(T n0). Then,
π∞:= (Fb(H ), Fb,ﬁn(V ), {B∞(f)|f ∈V })
is an irreducible representation of the CCR over V . By Theorem 5.49, we
have the following fact.
Lemma 13.8. The representation π∞is equivalent to the Fock represen-
tation πF(V ) if and only if there exists a vector h ∈H such that, for all
f ∈V , ℓT,∞(f) = ⟨h, f⟩H .
Example 13.10. For ℓT,∞in Example 13.8, π∞is inequivalent to πF(V )
if and only if g ̸∈D(T −1).
Example 13.11. For ℓT,∞in Example 13.9, π∞is inequivalent to πF(V )
if and only if φg ̸∈D(T n0).

4Originally, Wightman’s reconstruction theorem is established in the context of a rel-
ativistic QFT. However, as far as the construction of a Hilbert space, a quantum ﬁeld
and a Hamiltonian with a ground state is concerned, it is not restricted to relativistic
QFTs. The construction is essentially an application of the idea of the GNS construction
described in Section 15.1.6.
882
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that (Fb(H ), {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC} (VC := V ∩HC) is an
irreducible representation of the Heisenberg CCR over VC. Explicitly, we
have
φ∞(f) = φF(T −1/2f) −Re ℓT,∞(T −1/2f),
π∞(f ′) = πF(T 1/2f) + Im ℓT,∞(T 1/2f).
We construct a QFT whose time-zero ﬁeld and conjugate ﬁeld are equal
to φ∞(·) and π∞(·), respectively. As the Hamiltonian of the model to be
constructed, we take
H := dΓb(T ).
Then, H has a unique vacuum
Ω := ΩH .
Thus, the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) has a unique ground state.
It is easy to see that the Heisenberg operators
φ∞(t, f) := eitHφ∞(f)e−itH,
π∞(t, f) := eitHπ∞(f)e−itH
(t ∈R, f ∈D(T −1) ∩D(T n0) ∩HC) take the form
φ∞(t, f) = ΦS(eitT T −1/2f) −Re ℓT,∞(T −1/2f),
(13.71)
π∞(t, f) = ΦS(ieitT T 1/2f) + Im ℓT,∞(T 1/2f).
(13.72)
on D(N 1/2
b
).
In quite the same way as in the computations in Section 13.12.2, we can
prove the following formula: for all n ∈N, tj ∈R, fj ∈D(T −1) ∩D(T n0) ∩
HC, j = 1, . . . , n,
W ∞
n (t1, f1, t2, f2, . . . , tn, fn) = ⟨Ω, φ∞(t1, f1) · · · φ∞(tn, fn)Ω⟩.
Thus, the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) can be regarded as an
abstract vHM model describing the limit κ →∞of the cutoﬀmodel
(HT (g(κ)), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}).
We remark that, although the Hamiltonian H of the model con-
structed above is given by the second quantization dΓb(T ) of T , the model
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
883
(H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) is not equivalent to the free Bose ﬁeld model
(dΓb(T ), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}), provided that Re ℓT,∞̸= 0. In
the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}), the eﬀect of the interaction is in
the time-zero ﬁelds (φ∞(·), π∞(·)), not in H. As emphasized in Section 13.4,
a unitary equivalence of Hamiltonians is not suﬃcient for the quantum ﬁeld
models with them to be equivalent.
Let us derive the equations of φ∞(t, f). Let f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T 2) ∩
D(T n0) ∩HC. Then, by (13.71), (13.72) and Theorem 5.33, for all Ψ ∈
D(N 1/2
b
), φ∞(t, f)Ψ is twice strongly diﬀerentiable, with
d

and
d2
dt2 φ∞(t, f)Ψ = −

φ∞(t, T 2f) + Re ℓT,∞(T 3/2f)

Ψ.
Hence,
d2
dt2 φ∞(t, f) + φ∞(t, T 2f) = −Re ℓT,∞(T 3/2f)
(13.73)
on D(N 1/2
b
). Note that (13.14) and (13.73) are extensions of Theorem 13.3.
Example 13.12. Consider the situation in Example 13.8 with g ̸∈D(T −1).
Then, the model (HT (g), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}) has no ground
state, but the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) does. By Example 13.8,
we have ℓT,∞(f) =
	
T −1/2g, T −1/2f

. Hence, the ﬁeld equation takes the
following form: for all f ∈D(T −1/2) ∩D(T 2) ∩HC
d2
dt2 φ∞(t, f) + φ∞(t, T 2f) = −Re

g, T 1/2f

H
on D(N 1/2

), which is the same as (13.24).
Example 13.13. Consider the situation in Example 13.9 with g ̸∈H
and g ∈H−n0−1(T ), for some n0 ≥1. In this case, the vHM model
cannot be deﬁned in such a way that the Hamiltonian is of the form
HT (g). But the model (H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) can be regarded as
a model for such a case, describing the limit κ →∞of the model
884
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(HT (g(κ)), {φF(T −1/2f), πF(T 1/2f)|f ∈VC}). In the present case, the ﬁeld
equation is given by
d2
dt2 φ∞(t, f) + φ∞(t, T 2f) = −Re g(T 1/2f)
on D(N 1/2
b
).
The concrete vHM model with the point source ϱ(p) is a special case
of the present example with T = ω (m > 0) and g = ϱ(p)/√ω. Thus, we
have constructed the concrete vHM model with a point source, which has
a unique ground state.
From the analyses performed so far, we see that the representations of
time-zero ﬁelds as those of CCR play important roles:
(1) Even in the case where a quantum ﬁeld model has no ground state
in a representation of time-zero ﬁelds, it may have a ground state in
another representation of time-zero ﬁelds which is inequivalent to the
former one.
(2) In the case where the Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld model, with
the ultraviolet cutoﬀκ > 0, does not converge in a “natural” sense
to an operator within the Hilbert space under consideration in the
limit κ →∞of removing the ultraviolet cutoﬀ, but the VEVs con-
verge as κ →∞, the model without the ultraviolet cutoﬀmay be
constructed in a representation of time-zero ﬁelds inequivalent to the
Fock representation.
It is interesting that, in both cases, the representations of CCR inequivalent
to the Fock representation play essential roles.

of the model (see Theorem 13.9). Here, we assume that d ≥3 in the massless
case m = 0. Then, ϱκ/ω ∈L2(Rd) in the case of m = 0 too. By direct
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
885
computations, we have
Eκ = Sκ + Vκ(x1, . . . , xN),

It is obvious that, if d ≥2 in the case of m > 0 and d ≥3 in the case of
m = 0,
Sκ →−∞(κ →∞).
Concerning the limit κ →∞of Vκ, we consider only the case of d = 3
for simplicity (for other cases, see Remark 13.11). So, let d = 3. By change
of variables to the polar coordinate in R3, we have for x ̸= 0,

The above results may be interpreted as follows. Suppose that the point
sources at x1, . . . , xN are ﬁxed nucleons. Then, as mentioned before, the
concrete vHM model describes a model of bosons (neutral pions) interact-
ing with the ﬁxed nucleons. The interaction generates nuclear forces as a
result of exchanges of pions by nucleons. The ground state energy Eκ up to
constant additions may be interpreted as expressing the potential energy
of the nuclear forces in the ground state. It follows from (13.74) that
lim
κ→∞(Eκ −Sκ) =

j<n
λjλnVm(xj −xn).
Hence, 
j<n λjλnVm(xj −xn) is interpreted as the potential energy of
the nuclear forces in the ground state. The quantity Sκ diverging to −∞as
κ →∞is interpreted as a self-energy of the ﬁxed nucleons. The prescription
subtracting Sκ from Eκ to obtain a ﬁnite quantity in the limit κ →∞is an
example of the so-called energy renormalization. In this way, a quantum
ﬁeld theoretical derivation of the Yukawa-type potential or the Coulomb-
type potential is done.
13.16
Scattering Theory
In concluding this chapter, we consider the scattering theory in the abstract
vHM model (see Section 8.15 for a general theory of scattering). For nota-
tional simplicity, we use the following symbols:
H(g) := HT (g),
Hb := dΓb(T ).
We set
H(g) := H(g) −E(T, g) ≥0.
As we have seen, H(g) has no ground state if g ̸∈D(T −1) and T is abso-
lutely continuous. Hence, in this case, the scattering theory presented in
Van Hove–Miyatake Model
887
Section 8.15 cannot be applied.5 Taking this fact into account, in what fol-
lows, we assume (13.31). Under this condition, H(g) has a unique ground
state ΩT (g) (see Theorem 13.4).
Following the scheme of the scattering theory in Section 8.15, we deﬁne,
for (f, t) ∈D(T −1/2) × R,
At(f) := eitH(g)e−itHbA(f)eitHbe−itH(g)
= eitH(g)A(e−itT f)e−itH(g).
Theorem 13.15. Assume (13.31) and that T is absolutely continuous.
Then, for all f ∈D(T −1/2) and Ψ ∈D( H(g)1/2),
A±,0(f)Ψ :=
lim
t→±∞At(f)Ψ = C(f)Ψ,
(13.76)
A†
±,0(f)Ψ :=
lim
t→±∞At(f)∗Ψ = C(f)∗Ψ,
(13.77)
where C(f) is deﬁned by (13.49).
Proof. Let U := eiΦS(iT −1g). Then, by Theorem 13.4,
H(g) = UHbU −1.
Hence, by the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we have
eit 
H(g) = UeitHbU −1,
for all t ∈R. Therefore,
At(f) = UeitHbU −1A(e−itT f)Ue−itHbU −1
= UeitHb

A(e−itT f) −1
√
2
	
e−itT f, g


e−itHbU −1,
where we have used Theorem 5.30. Using the formula
eitHbA(e−itT f)e−itHb = A(f)
and Theorem 5.30 again, we obtain
At(f) = C(f) −1
√
2
	
e−itT f, g

.
Since T is absolutely continuous, it follows from Theorem C.2 in Appendix
C that limt→±∞
	
e−itT f, g

= 0. Hence, (13.76) follows. Similarly, (13.77)
is obtained.
□
5In this case, one can develop a diﬀerent type of scattering theory for the model
(H, {φ∞(f), π∞(f)|f ∈VC}) constructed in Section 13.14, employing the idea of the
so-called Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmermann(LSZ) formalism (see, for example, Bogoli-
ubov et al., 1975, Chapter 4, Section 2).

Formula (13.76) shows that, for all f ∈D(T −1/2),
A±(f) := A±,0(f) = C(f).
and
A±(f)∗= C(f)∗.
Note that
UA(f)U −1 = A±(f).
Hence, for all n ≥0 and fj ∈D(T −1/2) (j = 1, . . . , n),
UA(f1)∗· · · A(fn)∗ΩH = A±(f1)∗· · · A±(fn)∗ΩT (g).
Therefore,
Fin = Fout = Fb(H )
in the present case. But we have
A+(f)∗= A−(f)∗,
f ∈D(T −1/2).
Hence, the scattering operator S is the identity I on Fb(H ). Thus, in the
vHM model, there is no scattering.
Remark 13.12. One can also use the method in Section 8.15.7 to prove
(13.76) and (13.77). But, in this method, one needs an additional condition

Models in QFT
Some interacting quantum ﬁeld models are described.
14.1
Introduction
The vHM model discussed in the preceding chapter is a simple model in
QFT. Of course, there are other interacting quantum ﬁeld models which
are more complicated and/or more physically realistic. In this chapter, for
further studies, we present a list of interacting quantum ﬁeld models which
have been investigated so far in the ﬁeld of mathematical QFT, although
it is not a complete one.1 Interacting quantum ﬁeld models are mainly
classiﬁed into four categories:
(i) Purely bosonic ﬁeld models.
(ii) Purely fermionic ﬁeld models.
(iii) Boson–fermion interaction models.
(iv) Models of particle–ﬁeld interactions.
Here, models which are neither completely relativistic nor completely
Galilean symmetric are also included. Such models may play roles as
“approximate” versions of “true” models, which are expected to exist, or
phenomenological models, for example, in condensed matter physics. We
explain these categories one by one in the following. But, before doing that,
we remark on a common strategy for constructing quantum ﬁeld models.
To be deﬁnite, let us consider the case of constructing a relativistic
interacting neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld model in the (1 + d)-dimensional
space-time. In this case, a formal Hamiltonian of the model heuristi-
cally given in correspondence to the classical ﬁeld theory is ill-deﬁned
1There exist quantum ﬁeld models other than those mentioned in this chapter.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
since a point-wise quantum ﬁeld does not exist as a Hilbert space oper-
ator by Wightman’s theorem (see Remark 8.3(1); see also Example 10.2
and Remark 10.6). To avoid this diﬃculty, one usually proceeds as
follows:
Step 1. One introduces a momentum cutoﬀκ > 0 and a space cutoﬀL > 0
in the formal Hamiltonian to obtain a well-deﬁned operator H(L, κ) acting
in the boson Fock space Fb(L2(Rd
k)) and considers it as an approximate
Hamiltonian of the “true” Hamiltonian to be constructed, where L is a size
such that, only in the cubic box {x ∈Rd| |xj| ≤L/2, j = 1, . . . , d} or in
its neighborhood, the interaction of the quantum ﬁeld under consideration
occurs. Usually the time-zero ﬁelds are taken to be the Fock represen-
tation {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)}. In this way, one ﬁrst deﬁnes a cutoﬀ
model.
Step 2. One shows that H(L, κ) is essentially self-adjoint and bounded from
below. For notational simplicity, here we denote the closure of H(L, κ) by
the same symbol.
Step 3. Suppose that H(L, κ) contains parameters λ(j) ∈R, j = 1, . . . , J
(masses, charges, coupling constants, . . .) and write H(L, κ) = H(s) with
s := (L, κ, λ(1), . . . , λ(J)). Let Hn := H(sn) −En with sn := (Ln, κn, λ(1)
n ,
. . . , λ(J)
n ) and En ∈R (n ∈N). Then, one investigates if there exist a
sequence {(sn, En)}n and a self-adjoint operator H on Fb(L2(Rd
k)) such
that s- limn→∞e−itHn = e−itH, t ∈R.
In this step, one needs to perform detailed operator-theoretical analyses
of H(L, κ). However, in most cases (in particular, in models of relativis-
tic QFT), it is not expected that such a self-adjoint operator H exists.
This is closely related to the fact that, in non-trivial interacting quantum
ﬁeld models without cutoﬀs, inﬁnite renormalizations are necessary on the
level of perturbation theories. The sequence {(sn, En)}n is for a renormal-
ization of H(L, κ) which includes divergences (e.g., usually En →−∞as
n →∞).
Step 4. If a self-adjoint operator H in Step 3 exists, then one deﬁnes a
model without cutoﬀs, whose Hamiltonian is given by H, and investigates
the properties of this model (e.g., the spectral properties of H).
In the case where a self-adjoint operator H in Step 3 does not exist or
H is not expected to exist, one proceeds as follows:
Step

Step 4′. Let ϕ0(f) := φ0(f1) + iφ0(f2), f = f1 + if2 ∈S (Rd), f1, f2 ∈
SR(Rd). Then, one shows that, for all u ∈S (R) and f ∈S (Rd), the
Bochner integral2 ϕ(n)(u × f) :=

R u(t)eitHnϕ0(f)e−itHndt exists on a
suitable subspace and that the Wightman distributions with cutoﬀs


can be deﬁned (N ∈N, uj ∈S (R), fj ∈S (Rd), j = 1, . . . , N).
Step 5′. One shows that, for some {(sn, En)}n,
WN(u1 × f1, . . . , uN × fN) := lim
n→∞W (n)
N (u1 × f1, . . . , uN × fN)
exists and that it can be extended to a tempered distribution 
WN on
(R1+d)N.
Step 6′. One shows that {
WN}∞
N=0 (W0 := 1) satisﬁes the Wightman
axioms.
Similar strategies apply to other types of quantum ﬁeld models. Con-
cerning relativistic models, one can also adopt a strategy, called the
Euclidean strategy (see Section 8.12), whose goal is to construct Schwinger
functions of each model and show that they satisfy the Osterwalder–
Schrader axioms. For this approach, functional integration methods are
very useful (see, for example, Arai et al., 2016; Derezi´nski and G´erard,
2013, Chapter 21; Ezawa and Arai, 2023; Fern´andez et al., 1992; Glimm
and Jaﬀe, 1987; L¨orinczi et al., 2020; Hiroshima and L¨orinczi, 2020; Simon,
1974, 1979). A pedagogical and comprehensive review on mathematical
methods to study quantum ﬁeld models is found in Arai (2002).
With the above remarks, in what follows, we deﬁne only models with
cutoﬀs which form starting points for the construction of models without
cutoﬀs or models with more symmetries.
14.2
Purely Bosonic Field Models
A purely bosonic ﬁeld model is a model which describes only a
self-interaction of a Bose ﬁeld and/or an interaction among Bose ﬁelds
of diﬀerent kinds. In this category, there are two classes: relativistic and
non-relativistic.

14.2.1
P (φ)1+d model
In the classical ﬁeld theory, one can consider a real scalar ﬁeld φcl :
M1+d →R on the (1 + d)-dimensional Minkowski space-time M1+d sat-
isfying a nonlinear KG equation—a nonlinear perturbation of the free
KG equation:
(□+ m2)φcl(x) = −4λφcl(x)3 −2σφcl(x) + μ,
x = (t, x) ∈M1+d,
(14.1)
where m > 0, λ > 0, σ ∈R and μ ≥0 are parameters. The right-hand side
gives a form of nonlinear self-interactions of the ﬁeld φcl. A model of this
type is called a classical φ4
1+d model.
A generalization of this model is given by a real scalar ﬁeld φcl satisfying
a more general non-linear KG equation
(□+ m2)φcl(x) = −P ′(φcl(x)),
x ∈M1+d,
(14.2)
where P : R →R is a real polynomial of the form
P(φ) =
2p

r=0
arφr,
φ ∈R
(14.3)
with coeﬃcients a2p > 0, ar ∈R, r = 0, 1, . . . , 2p −1 (p ∈N, p ≥2) and P ′
is the derivative of P. Note that P is bounded from below (Problem 2(i)).
This model is called the classical P(φ)1+d model.
It is easy to see that the Lagrangian density for (14.2) is given by
LP(x) := 1
2

˙φ(x)2 −(∇φcl(x))2 −m2φcl(x)2
−P(φcl(x)).
Hence, the canonical conjugate momentum πcl := ∂LP/∂˙φcl is found to be
πcl = ˙φcl.
Therefore, the Hamiltonian Hcl
P of the model is given by
Hcl
P :=
	
Rd{πcl(x) ˙φcl(x) −LP (x)}dx
= 1
2
	
Rd{πcl(x)2 + (∇φcl(x))2 + m2φcl(x)}dx +
	
Rd P(φcl(x))dx.
By using (14.2), it is shown that, under suitable conditions for φcl and πcl,
dHcl
P /dt = 0, i.e., Hcl
P is independent of time t. Hence, Hcl
P is written in
Models in QFT
897
terms of the time-zero ﬁelds:
Hcl
P = 1
2
	
Rd{πcl(0, x)2 + (∇φcl(0, x))2 + m2φcl(0, x)}dx
+
	
Rd P(φcl(0, x))dx.
(14.4)
With these preliminaries, we now deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld version of the
above classical model. As the time-zero ﬁelds of the quantum ﬁeld model,
we take the representation {φ0(f), π0(f)|f ∈SR(Rd)} of the Heisenberg
CCR over SR(Rd) given by (10.15) and (10.16).3 Then, the regularized
quantum version of the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (14.4) is given
by the second quantization Hb of ω (see (10.14)), which is the Hamilto-
nian of the relativistic free neutral KG ﬁeld (for heuristic arguments, see
Problem 2 in Chapter 10). To deﬁne a quantum version of the second term

Rd P(φcl(0, x))dx on the right-hand side of (14.4), however, we need some
regularizations because the rth power φ0(x)r of the operator-valued distri-
bution kernel φ0(x) of φ0(f) has no mathematical meaning for all r ≥2.
To avoid this diﬃculty, we use the operator
φκ(x) := φκ(0, x),
(14.5)
the time-zero operator of the free quantum KG ﬁeld φκ(t, x) with momen-
tum cutoﬀκ > 0 (see (10.78)). Then, φκ(x)r is well deﬁned for all
r ≥1 and x ∈Rd. By (10.78) and estimate (5.119), we see that, for all
Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)),

L2(Rd) =
CΨ,r

L2(Rd)
,
where CΨ,r ≥0 is a constant independent of x ∈Rd. Hence, for all g ∈
L1(Rd) and r ∈N, the Bochner integral4 
Rd g(x)φκ(x)rΨdx exists because

Rd ∥g(x)φκ(x)rΨ∥dx ≤C

Rd |g(x)|dx < ∞with a constant C > 0.
We also need a Wick product regularization of φκ(x)r, i.e., instead of
φκ(x)r, we use the Wick product
: φκ(x)r : (=: ΦS(gκ,x)r :)
3Of course, one can take other representations of the Heisenberg CCR. Generally, it
may be an interesting theme to clarify the dependencies of model constructions on the
representations of CCR.

form:
: φκ(x)r := φκ(x)r +
r−1

j=0
crφκ(x)j,
where each cr is a constant independent of x. Hence, for all Ψ
∈
Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)), the Bochner integral

Rd g(x) : φκ(x)r : Ψdx exists. There-
fore, for the Wick product : P(φκ(x)) : deﬁned by
: P(φκ(x)) :=
2p

r=0
ar : φκ(x)r :,
the Bochner integral

Rd g(x) : P(φκ(x)) : Ψdx exists. Thus, we can deﬁne
an operator Vκ,g on Fb(L2(Rd
k)) as follows:
D (Vκ,g) := Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)),
(14.6)
Vκ,gΨ :=
	
Rd g(x) : P(φκ(x)) : Ψdx,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)).
(14.7)
The operator Vκ,g is a regularized quantum version corresponding to the
second term (the self-interaction term of φcl) on the right-hand side of
(14.4). The operator Vκ,g is symbolically written as
Vκ,g =
	
Rd g(x) : P(φκ(x)) : dx.
The function g is called a space cutoﬀ, or a volume cutoﬀ.
Let g ∈L1(Rd) and g ≥0. Then, the Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld
model corresponding to the classical theory described by (14.2) is deﬁned by
Hκ,g := Hb + Vκ,g.
(14.8)
It is easy to see that Fb,ﬁn(D(ω)) ∩Fb,0(L2(Rd
k)) is a subset of D(Hκ,g) =
D(Hb) ∩D(Vκ,g). Hence, Hκ,g is densely deﬁned. Moreover, Vκ,g is a
symmetric operator and bounded from below (Problem 2(ii)–(iii)). Thus, we
Models in QFT
899
see that Hκ,g is a symmetric operator and bounded from below. The
quantum ﬁeld model with the Hamiltonian Hκ,g is called the P(φ)1+d
model with momentum cutoﬀκ and space cutoﬀg (or, simply, a
cutoﬀP(φ)1+d model). This model is not fully relativistic and only “approx-
imately” relativistic because it has cutoﬀs. The analysis of this model should
be regarded as a ﬁrst step toward the construction of a P(φ)1+d model with-
out cutoﬀs, which is expected to be a completely relativistic P(φ)1+d model.
With regard to the cutoﬀP(φ)1+d model, functional integral methods are
useful, in addition to operator-theoretical methods.
The goal of the analysis of the cutoﬀmodel Hκ,g is to show that the
cutoﬀtheory has a limit in a suitable sense as κ →∞(the removal of
the ultraviolet cutoﬀ) and g(x) →1 (the removal of the space cutoﬀ) and
to prove that the limiting theory is non-trivial (i.e., inequivalent to a free
QFT), satisfying the axioms of relativistic QFT. But it turns out that this
is a very diﬃcult problem. So far, the following results are known (only
rough statements are given; for more exact statements, see the references

(1) In the case of d = 1 (i.e., the case of the two-dimensional space-time),
a P(φ)2 model without cutoﬀs exists and is non-trivial, satisfying the
Wightman axioms (Glimm and Jaﬀe, 1985, 1987; Simon, 1974).

(3) In the case of d ≥4, a construction of φ4

a lattice approximation gives a trivial theory (Aizenman, 1981, 1982;
Ezawa and Arai, 2023; Fern´andez et al., 1992; Fr¨ohlich, 1982; Arai

The result (3) with d = 4 (the most interesting case) may discourage one
because it suggests the absence of non-trivial φ4

in its conventional form. But one can also consider it as a suggestion that
a completely new approach may be needed to construct a non-trivial rela-

the conventional notion of the quantum ﬁeld. The problem of constructing

Scalar quantum electrodynamics
Charged spin-zero particles (e.g., π± mesons) interact with the quantum
radiation ﬁeld. The quantum ﬁeld of charged spin-zero particles is given
by a charged quantum scalar ﬁeld (see Section 10.16). Therefore, one is
led to consider a model of a charged quantum scalar ﬁeld interacting with
the quantum radiation ﬁeld. This class of QFT is called scalar quantum
electrodynamics, or the (abelian) Higgs–Kibble model, in the context
of the electro-weak part in the standard model of particle physics.
See, for example, Itzykson and Zuber (1980), 6-1-4 for heuristic physical
arguments and Arai (1991b) for a rigorous deﬁnition of the Hamiltonian of
a scalar quantum electrodynamics with momentum and space cutoﬀs.
14.2.3
Non-Relativistic Bose ﬁeld theories
We have considered a self-interacting non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld in Section
9.7.2, which is deﬁned through a perturbation of the free bosonic quantum
de Broglie ﬁeld. In this section, we deﬁne its ﬁnite volume version, which is a
starting point for the construction and analysis of inﬁnite volume theories of
a self-interacting non-relativistic Bose ﬁeld. So, let us consider the QFT on
the cubic box VL described in Section 9.9. We use the notation introduced
there. For each κ > 0, we introduce the point-like quantum ﬁeld ψκ(x) on
VL (x ∈VL) with momentum cutoﬀκ by
ψκ(x) :=

k∈ΓL,κ
aL(k)φk(x)
(14.9)
acting in the boson Fock space Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), where
ΓL,κ := {k ∈ΓL||kj| ≤κ, j = 1, . . . , d}.
The

commutation
relations
which
{ψκ(x), ψκ(x)∗|x ∈VL} obeys (see Problem 3).
Let W : VL →R be continuous satisfying W(x) = W(−x), ∀x ∈VL.
Then, it is easy to see that, for all x, y ∈Rd,
Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)) ⊂D(ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y))
Models in QFT

and, for all Ψ ∈Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)),
	
VL×VL
|W(x −y)| ∥ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y)Ψ∥dxdy < ∞.
Hence, the Bochner integral
	
VL×VL
W(x −y)ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y)Ψdxdy
exists. Therefore, we can deﬁne a linear operator H(L)
I,κ (W) on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL))
as follows:
D(H(L)
I,κ (W)) := Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)),
(14.10)
H(L)
I,κ (W)Ψ :=
	
VL×VL
W(x −y)ψκ(x)∗ψκ(y)∗ψκ(x)ψκ(y)Ψdxdy,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
(14.11)
Note that
H(L)
I,κ (W) = 0
on C ⊕ℓ2(ΓL) ⊕{0} ⊕{0} ⊕· · · ⊂Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
It is easy to see that H(L)
I,κ (W) is a symmetric operator.
Since H(L)
I,κ (W) annihilates two particles and creates two particles, it
follows that H(L)
I,κ (W) leaves each n-particle space left invariant, i.e., it
preserves the particle number.
As a generalization of the kinetic energy ENR of a non-relativistic free
particle (see (9.35)), we take as the kinetic energy function of a non-
relativistic free boson a non-negative continuous function ϵ : Rd →[0, ∞).
Then, we consider a model of self-interacting bosons whose Hamiltonian is
of the form
HL,κ(W) := H(L)
0
+ H(L)
I,κ (W),
(14.12)
where

:= dΓ(L)
b (ϵ) =

k∈ΓL
ϵ(k)aL(k)∗aL(k)
(see Proposition 9.12). It is easy to see that HL,κ(W) is a symmetric oper-
ator. By direct computations, we see that

a considerable number of articles on the model have been published. Here,

Purely Fermionic Field Models
A purely fermionic ﬁeld model is a model which describes only a
self-interaction of a Fermi ﬁeld and/or an interaction among Fermi ﬁelds
of diﬀerent kinds. As in the case of purely bosonic ﬁeld models, purely
fermionic ﬁeld models are also classiﬁed into relativistic and non-relativistic
ones.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
14.3.1
A model of a self-interacting quantum Dirac ﬁeld
In Chapter 12, we considered a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld on the four-
dimensional space-time. As in the case of quantum scalar ﬁelds, one can
consider models of a self-interacting quantum Dirac ﬁeld. Here, we consider
only one model whose classical ﬁeld equation is given by a nonlinear Dirac
equation
(iγμ∂μ −M)ψ(x) = λ[ψ(x)γμψ(x)]γμψ(x)
for ψ : M4 →C4, where λ ∈R denotes a coupling constant. A Lagrangian
density for this equation is given by
ψ(x)(iγμ∂μ −M)ψ(x) −λ
2 [ψ(x)γμψ(x)][ψ(x)γμψ(x)].
It follows that the interaction part in the classical Hamiltonian is
(λ/2)

R3[ψ(x)γμψ(x)][ψ(x)γμψ(x)]dx. But the quantum ﬁeld version of
this quantity makes no sense unless a momentum cutoﬀand a space cut-
oﬀare introduced. Hence, in what follows, we ﬁrst deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld
Hamiltonian with cutoﬀs.
Let ψg(t, x) be given by (12.169) and, for each κ > 0,
Ψκ(x) := ψχκ(0, x),
(14.19)
where χκ is given by (10.77). The operator Ψκ(x) is called the time-zero
quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀκ. It follows that Ψκ(x)
is a bounded linear operator on the fermion Fock space FD (see (12.116))
(see also Problem 4). By (12.171), we have
∥Ψκ(x)∥≤Cκ,
where Cκ := ∥χκ∥L2(R3)/

(2π)3 = 4πκ3/3

(2π)3. Hence,
∥[Ψκ(x)γμΨκ(x)][Ψκ(x)γμΨκ(x)]∥≤C4
κ.
Therefore, for each real-valued function g ∈L1(R3), the Bochner integral
HI(g, κ) :=
	
R3 g(x)[Ψκ(x)γμΨκ(x)][Ψκ(x)γμΨκ(x)]dx
exists as a bounded operator on FD. Using the property
γ0(γμ)∗γ0 = γμ,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3,
Models in QFT
905
one sees that Ψκ(x)γμΨκ(x) is a bounded self-adjoint operator. Hence, it fol-
lows that HI(g, κ) is a bounded self-adjoint operator. The operator HI(g, κ)
describes a self-interaction of a quantum Dirac ﬁeld with cutoﬀs. Let HD be
the Hamiltonian of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of mass M (see (12.145)).
Then, the Hamiltonian of the quantum ﬁeld model with cutoﬀs correspond-
ing to the above classical model is deﬁned by
Hg,κ := HD + HI(g, κ).
Since HI(g, κ) is bounded, it follows from the Kato–Rellich theorem that
Hg,κ is a self-adjoint operator on FD and bounded from below.
Remark 14.1. There is a two-dimensional space-time version of the above
model, called the Thirring model (Thirring, 1958). The massless Thirring
model (the case of M = 0) without cutoﬀs is exactly soluble in a sense and
has been extensively studied in both the physics and mathematical physics
literatures (e.g., Carey et al., 1985; Ruijsenaars, 1982 for mathematically
rigorous analyses). Also, the massive Thirring model (the case of M > 0)
without cutoﬀs has interesting structures (see, for example, Benfatto et al.,
2009 for a recent mathematical study).
14.3.2
A non-relativistic self-interacting Fermi ﬁeld model:
The BCS model
One can consider a fermionic version of the model discussed in Section
14.2.3. A diﬀerence from the bosonic ﬁeld model is in taking into account
the spin degrees of freedom. For simplicity, we consider a quantum ﬁeld of
non-relativistic fermions with spin 1/2 (typically, non-relativistic electrons)
on a cubic box VL (see (9.87)). The Hilbert space of state vectors for a
fermion of spin 1/2 can be taken to be
HL := ℓ2(ΓL) ⊕ℓ2(ΓL)
in the momentum representation. Then, the Fermion Fock space
FNRF := Ff(HL)
over HL becomes the Hilbert space for a Fermi ﬁeld to be considered.
We denote by bL(f) (f = (f+, f−) ∈HL) the fermion annihilation
operator on FNRF. For each k ∈ΓL and s = ±, we deﬁne an operator
bs(k) by
b+(k) := bL(δk, 0),
b−(k) := bL(0, δk),
906
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where δk ∈ℓ2(ΓL) is deﬁned by δk(k′) := δkk′, k′ ∈ΓL. It follows that, for
all s, s′ = ± and k, k′ ∈ΓL, bs(k)# is bounded with ∥bs(k)#∥= 1 and
{bs(k), bs′(k′)∗} = δss′δkk′,
{bs(k), bs′(k′)} = 0,
{bs(k)∗, bs′(k′)∗} = 0.
For each κ > 0 and s = ±, we deﬁne a cutoﬀFermi ﬁeld ψκ,s(x) (x ∈VL) by
ψκ,s(x) :=

k∈ΓL,κ
bs(k)φk(x).
(14.20)
This is a bounded operator with
∥ψκ,s(x)∥≤

k∈ΓL,κ
1
Ld/2 ≤

Ld/2
Lκ
π + 1
d
.
One can also ﬁnd anti-commutation relations which {ψκ,s(x), ψκ,s(x)∗|s =
±, x ∈VL} obeys (see Problem 5).
Let W : VL →R be as in Section 14.2.3. Then, as in the case of the
operator H(L)
I,κ (W) in Section 14.2.3, one can show that
GI,κ(W) :=

s,s′=±
	
VL×VL
W(x −y)ψκ,s(x)∗ψκ,s′(x)∗ψκ,s′(y)ψκ,s(y)dxdy
is a bounded self-adjoint operator on FNRF. This operator describes a self-
interaction of the Fermi ﬁeld ψκ,s(x). It follows that
GI,κ(W) := 1
Ld

ˆW(k1 −k3)δk1+k2,k3+k4
×bs(k1)∗bs′(k2)∗bs′(k3)bs(k4).
The total Hamiltonian of the model we consider is deﬁned by
HBCS := dΓf(ϵ) + GI,κ(W),
where dΓf(ϵ) denotes the fermion second quantization operator of ϵ on
FNRF. Since GI,κ is a bounded self-adjoint operator, it follows from the
Kato–Rellich theorem that HBCS is self-adjoint and bounded from below.
The Hamiltonian HBCS is called the Bardeen–Cooper–Schriefer (BCS)
Hamiltonian (Bardeen et al., 1957). It is used as a starting point to explain
superconductivity, a phenomenon in which the electric resistance of a
metal vanishes below a critical temperature. The mathematical analyses
of HBCS (spectral properties, removal of the ultraviolet cutoﬀκ and the
Models in QFT
907
space cutoﬀL, in relation to the so-called mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian, etc.) are
non-trivial. There is a large number of articles on the analysis of HBCS.
An earlier important contribution to the mathematical analysis of the BCS
model was presented by Kato (1965). For recent studies, see, for example,
Hainzl and Seiringer (2016) and references therein.
14.4
Models of Bose Fields Interacting with Fermi Fields
14.4.1
Yukawa model
We consider a model of a quantum Dirac ﬁeld interacting with a quantum
scalar ﬁeld in the four-dimensional space-time. One can take as the Hilbert
space of state vectors of such a model the tensor product Hilbert space
FDS := FD ⊗Fb(L2(R3
k)),
of the fermion Fock space FD for a free quantum Dirac ﬁeld (see (12.116))
and the boson Fock space Fb(L2(R3
k)) for a free quantum scalar ﬁeld. We
denote by HD and Hb the Hamiltonians of the free quantum Dirac ﬁeld of
mass M ≥0 and the free quantum scalar ﬁeld of mass m ≥0, respectively
(see (12.145) and (10.14)). Then, the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the model
to be considered is deﬁned by
H0 := HD ⊗I + I ⊗Hb,
which is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on FDS.
As in the previous interacting ﬁeld models, one has to introduce a space
cutoﬀand a momentum cutoﬀto deﬁne an interaction between a quantum
Dirac ﬁeld and a quantum scalar ﬁeld. Let φκ(x) and Ψκ(x) (κ > 0, x ∈R3)
be given by (14.5) and (14.19), respectively. Let χ ∈L1(R3) be real-valued.
Then, for all Ψ ∈FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3
k)), the Bochner integral
	
R3 χ(x)(: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x) :) ⊗φκ(x)Ψdx
exists, where : · : denotes the Wick product for Ψκ(x)#. Hence, one can
deﬁne an operator HI,χ,κ as follows:
D(HI,χ,κ) := FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3
k)),
HI,χ,κΨ :=
	
R3 χ(x)(: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x) :) ⊗φκ(x)Ψdx.
908
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It follows that HI,χ,κ is a symmetric operator on FDS. We denote the
closure of HI,χ,κ by the same symbol. The total Hamiltonian of the model
is deﬁned by
Hχ,κ := H0 + HI,χ,κ.
The subspace
DE,ω := ∧ﬁn(D(E))ˆ⊗Fb,ﬁn(D(ω))
is dense in FDS and DE,ω ⊂D(Hχ,κ). Hence, Hχ,κ is symmetric. With
regard to the self-adjointness of Hχ,κ, one has the following fact.
Theorem 14.2. The Hamiltonian Hχ,κ is self-adjoint with D(Hχ,κ) =
D(H0) and bounded from below.
Proof. Let Ψ ∈DE,ω. Then, since ∥: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x) : ∥≤Cκ (a constant
independent of x), we have
∥HI,χ,κΨ∥≤Cκ
	
R3 |χ(x)| ∥I ⊗φκ(x)Ψ∥dx.
By an application of (13.14), we have for all Φ ∈D(H1/2

∥φκ(x)Φ∥≤

where C1κ and C2κ are positive constants. It is easy to see that
∥I ⊗H1/2

Ψ∥≤∥H1/2

Ψ∥.
Hence,
∥HI,χ,κΨ∥≤C1κ∥H1/2

For any ε > 0,
C1κ∥H0Ψ∥1/2∥Ψ∥1/2 ≤ε∥H0Ψ∥+ C2
1κ
4ε ∥Ψ∥.
Hence,
∥HI,χ,κΨ∥≤ε∥H0Ψ∥+ bε,κ∥Ψ∥
with a constant bε,κ > 0. Note that DE,ω is a core for H0. Hence, by a
limiting argument, the above inequality extends to all Ψ ∈D(H0), showing
that HI,χ,κ is inﬁnitesimally small with respect to H0. Therefore, by the
Kato–Rellich theorem, the desired result follows.
□
The quantum ﬁeld model whose Hamiltonian is Hχ,κ is called a Yukawa
model with momentum and space cutoﬀs.
The two-dimensional space-time version of the Yukawa model, denoted
Yukawa2, was extensively studied, and the existence of a Yukawa2 model
without cutoﬀs which satisﬁes the Wightman axioms was shown. For a
review, see Glimm and Jaﬀe (1987), Section 23.4. For recent studies of
Yukawa models with cutoﬀs, see, for example, Aschbacher et al. (2011),
Barbaroux and Guillot (2009), and Takaesu (2011).
14.4.2
Quantum electrodynamics
The quantum theory describing the interaction of a quantum Dirac
ﬁeld (typically, the relativistic quantum electron ﬁeld) with the quantum
radiation ﬁeld is called quantum electrodynamics (QED). The QED
of the quantum electron ﬁeld, as a physical theory, predicts quantum
electromagnetic phenomena with surprisingly high precision (Kinoshita,
1990), although the predictions are based on formal perturbations theo-
ries with renormalization procedures (e.g., Scharf, 1989; Steinmann, 2000).
Despite the success of QED as a physical theory, it still remains to show the
existence of QED in the four-dimensional space-time as a mathematically
well-deﬁned theory. This is one of the most important (but most diﬃcult)
problems in mathematical physics. An axiomatic treatment of QED is found
in Strocchi (2013).
As is mentioned in Remark 11.1, one needs an indeﬁnite metric space to
construct a model of QED in a manifestly covariant way. Here, for simplic-
ity, we present the Hamiltonian of a cutoﬀmodel of QED in the Coulomb

and the boson Fock space Frad with d = 3 (see (11.17)) for the quantum
radiation ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge.
Let Ψκ(x) (x ∈R3) be the time-zero quantum Dirac ﬁeld with momen-
tum cutoﬀκ > 0 (see (14.19)) and
Aκ
j (x) := Aρκ,j(0, x),
(14.21)
where Aρκ,j(t, x) (t ∈R) is deﬁned by (11.36) with d = 3 and ρκ(k) =
χ[0,κ](|k|), k ∈R3. The operator Aκ
j (x) is self-adjoint. As in the case of
the Yukawa interaction HI,χ,κ in Section 14.4.1, it is shown that, for each
g ∈L1(R3) and Ψ ∈FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3) ⊕L2(R3)), the Bochner integral
	
R3 g(x) : Ψκ(x)∗αjΨκ(x) : ⊗Aκ
j (x)Ψdx (j = 1, 2, 3)
exists. Hence, one can deﬁne an operator HI as follows:
D(HI) := FD ˆ⊗Fb,0(L2(R3) ⊕L2(R3)),
HIΨ :=
3

j=1
	
R3 g(x) : Ψκ(x)∗αjΨκ(x) : ⊗Aκ
j (x)Ψdx, Ψ ∈D(HI).
It is easy to see that HI is symmetric and hence closable. We denote the
closure of HI by the same symbol. The closed symmetric operator HI rep-
resents the interaction between the quantum Dirac ﬁeld and the quantum
radiation ﬁeld with momentum cutoﬀκ and space-cutoﬀg.
In the Coulomb gauge, the self-interaction term of the quantum Dirac
ﬁeld appears in the form
HIIΨ := 1
8π
	
R3×R3
h(x)h(y)
|x −y|
: Ψκ(x)∗Ψκ(x)Ψκ(y)∗Ψκ(y) : Ψdxdy
(Bochner integral), where Ψ ∈FQED and h ∈L2(R3) is a space cutoﬀ
such that h ≥0 and

R3 |ˆh(k)|2/|k|2dk < ∞. Since Ψκ(x) is bounded with
Models in QFT
911
an operator norm independent of x, one can show that the norm of the
right-hand side is less than or equal to
C∥Ψ∥
	
R3×R3
h(x)h(y)
|x −y| dxdy ≤4πC∥Ψ∥
	
R3
|ˆh(k)|2
|k|2
dk < ∞,
where C > 0 is a constant. Hence, it follows that HII is a bounded self-
adjoint operator on FQED.
The total Hamiltonian of the model is deﬁned by
H := HD ⊗I + I ⊗Hrad + qHI + q2HII,
where HD and Hrad are the free Hamiltonian of the quantum Dirac ﬁeld
and the quantum radiation ﬁeld, respectively (see (12.145) and (11.34)),
and q ∈R denotes the charge of the Dirac particle under consideration.
In the same way as in the proof of Theorem 14.2, one can prove that H is
self-adjoint and bounded from below, with D(H) = D(HD⊗I)∩D(I⊗Hrad).
For further analyses of the model and related ones, see, for example, Wakita
(1976), Barbarroux et al. (2004), and Takaesu (2009, 2018).
Remark 14.2. There is a two-dimensional space-time version of QED,
called the Schwinger model (Schwinger, 1962). This model can be solved
exactly (e.g., the quantum ﬁelds involved are explicitly represented) and
is used as a simpliﬁed model for the original QED or other more com-
plex interacting quantum ﬁeld models. The Schwinger model is interest-
ing in that it exhibits characteristic phenomena, such as conﬁnement of
the fermions, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the U(1) symmetry (see
Chapter 15) and the Higgs mechanism (a photon becomes massive), and
has been extensively studied (hence there are many articles on the model).
We only refer the reader to Ito (1977), Strocchi (2013), Section 8.3 and
references therein.
14.4.3
Supersymmetric quantum ﬁelds
In Section 7.14, we mentioned supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theory
(SQFT) as supersymmetric quantum mechanics with inﬁnite degrees of
freedom and constructed an abstract supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld model
(F(H , K ), Γ, QS, dΓ(S∗S, SS∗)) (see Remark 7.9). This abstract model
produces concrete supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld models according to the
choice of (H , K , S) (see, for example, Arai, 1993b, 2022). A feature of
912
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld models is that they may be less singular
than non-supersymmetric ones in the sense that, in supersymmetric quan-
tum ﬁeld models, some cancellations of ultraviolet divergences may occur.
Supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld models in the two-dimensional space-time
without ultraviolet cutoﬀ(but with space cutoﬀ) have been constructed
(see, for example, Jaﬀe et al., 1988 and references therein). It seems, how-
ever, that no completely relativistic supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld mod-
els with interactions have been constructed even in the two-dimensional
space-time.
14.5
Particle–Field Interaction Models
There are models which describe interactions of quantum particles with
a quantum ﬁeld (mainly a Bose ﬁeld). One of the most important
classes of models in this category is non-relativistic QED, which is
the quantum theory describing non-relativistic charged particles (typically,
non-relativistic electrons) interacting with the quantum radiation ﬁeld,
explaining with relatively high precision electromagnetic phenomena in
“non-relativistic regions” (for the physics of non-relativistic QED, see, for
example, Barut, 1980; Healy, 1982 and, for mathematically rigorous theo-
ries, see, for example, Spohn, 2004).
For simplicity, let us consider the case where the quantum ﬁeld under
consideration is a Bose ﬁeld. The Hilbert space of state vectors of a model
of this type is taken to be of the form
Fpb := Hp ⊗Fb(H ),
where Hp is a Hilbert space for the particle system and H is a one-particle
Hilbert space for the Bose ﬁeld. A general form of the Hamiltonian of such
a model is given by
Hpb := Hp ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb) + Hint,
where Hp is a self-adjoint operator on Hp, denoting the Hamiltonian of
the particle system, dΓb(hb) is the boson second quantization operator of
a non-negative injective self-adjoint operator hb on H (the one-particle
Hamiltonian of the Bose ﬁeld) and Hint is a symmetric operator, denoting
an interaction of the particle system with the Bose ﬁeld.
Remark 14.3. From a more general point of view, the Hilbert space
Hp can be a Hilbert space of state vectors of any quantum system (not
Models in QFT
913
necessarily a quantum-particle system in its concrete realization). For exam-
ple, Hp may be taken to be H ′ ⊗Ff(K ), the tensor product of a Hilbert
space H ′ and the fermion Fock space over a Hilbert space K , so that
Fpb = H ′ ⊗Ff(K ) ⊗Fb(H ). As is seen, this Hilbert space may be the
most general Hilbert space in the sense that it gives a framework for a
quantum theory describing an interaction of a quantum system (associated
with H ′) with a Bose ﬁeld and a Fermi ﬁeld.
Before discussing concrete models in the category under consideration,
we make a remark on a general feature concerning the spectral analysis
of Hpb. To be deﬁnite, we consider the case where Hp and hb have the
following spectral structures:
σd(Hp) = {En}N
n=1,
E1 < E2 < · · · < En < En+1 < · · · < Σ,
σess(Hp) = [Σ, ∞),
σ(hb) = σc(hb) = [m, ∞)
with N < ∞or N = ∞(we use the convention that σess(Hp) = ∅⇐⇒Σ =
∞, the case where the spectrum of Hp is purely discrete) and m ≥0. In
this case, we have by an application of Theorem 5.3
σp(dΓb(hb)) = {0},
σc(dΓb(hb)) = [m, ∞),
where the eigenvalue 0 is simple and its eigenvector is the Fock vacuum ΩH
up to constant multiples. Hence, by the spectral theory of tensor products
of self-adjoint operators (see Theorems 3.8 and 3.13), the spectrum of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian
Hpb,0 := Hp ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb)
is identiﬁed as follows (Fig. 14.1):
σp(Hpb,0) = {En}N
n=1,
σc(Hpb,0) = [E1 + m, ∞).
As is seen, any eigenvalue Ej more than or equal to E1 +m is embedded
in the continuous spectrum of Hpb,0, i.e., it is an embedded eigenvalue of
Hpb,0. In particular, if m = 0 (the massless case), then all the eigenvalues
of Hpb,0 are embedded ones. Hence, the spectral analysis of Hpb includes
the perturbation problem of embedded eigenvalues, which are diﬃcult to
treat in general because, in this case, the method of the standard analytic
(regular) perturbation theory (e.g., Kato, 1976; Reed and Simon, 1978) is
914

not valid any more. One must seek essentially new methods to solve the
perturbation problem of embedded eigenvalues in quantum ﬁeld theory.6
In the late 1990s, breakthroughs in this problem have been made by Arai
and Hirokawa (1997) and Bach et al. (1998a, 1998b). For a review on this
aspect, we refer the reader to Hiroshima (2005b, 2019).
We now describe some models.
14.5.1
Nelson model
In the vHM model in the context of nuclear physics, the ﬁxed sources are
nucleons (see Section 13.1). But one can consider more realistic models by
taking into account the motion of nucleons and the iso-spin of the π-meson.
In the following, we deﬁne the simplest one among such models.
We consider a d-dimensional system of N non-relativistic quantum
particles of mass M > 0 interacting with a neutral quantum scalar ﬁeld.
We suppose that the particles are in a potential V : (Rd)N →R, a Borel
measurable function a.e. ﬁnite. A choice of (Hp, Hp, H , hb) for the model
is given as follows:
Hp = L2((Rd)N), Hp = −
N

j=1
1
2M Δxj + V (a Schr¨odinger operator),
H = L2(Rd), hb = ω,
where Δxj is the generalized Laplacian in the variable xj ∈Rd (we write
a point x ∈(Rd)N as x = (x1, . . . , xN), xj ∈Rd, j = 1, . . . , N) and ω
is deﬁned by (10.2) (if the quantum scalar ﬁeld under consideration is the
π0-meson ﬁeld, then m > 0, denoting the mass of a π0-meson). Hence, in
6As for quantum mechanics using Schr¨odinger operators, methods to analyze the per-
turbation problem of embedded eigenvalues have been established (see, for example,
Reed and Simon, 1978, Section XII.6).
Models in QFT
915
the present case,
Fpb = L2((Rd)N) ⊗Fb(L2(Rd)) ∼=
	 ⊕
(Rd)N Fb(L2(Rd))dx,
where
 ⊕
(Rd)N Fb(L2(Rd))dx is the constant ﬁbre direct integral over
((Rd)N, dx) with ﬁbre Fb(L2(Rd)) (see Section 2.8).
Remark 14.4. If one takes into account the statistics of the N particles
(fermions or bosons), then L2((Rd)N) should be replaced by ∧NL2(Rd) in
the case of fermions and by L2
sym((Rd)N) in the case of bosons.
To deﬁne an interaction of the quantum particles with the quantum
ﬁeld, it turns out that it is more convenient to use the identiﬁcation
of Fpb with
 ⊕
(Rd)N Fb(L2(Rd))dx. Hence, in what follows, we use this
identiﬁcation.
Let φκ(x) be given by (14.5) as before. Then, for each j = 1, . . . , N, one
can deﬁne a mapping φκ,j : (Rd)N →L(Fb(L2(Rd))) by
φκ,j(x) := φκ(xj),
x = (x1, . . . , xN).
Since, for each x ∈Rd, φκ(x) is self-adjoint, it follows that φκ,j is a self-
adjoint mapping. Hence, by Theorem 2.7, the direct integral operator
ˆφκ,j :=
	 ⊕
Rd φκ,j(x)dx
is self-adjoint. An interaction of the quantum particles with the quantum
scalar ﬁeld is given by N
j=1 gj ˆφκ,j, with gj’s being real parameters denoting
coupling constants. Thus, one arrives at a model whose Hamiltonian is
deﬁned by
HN(κ) := Hp + Hb +
N

j=1
gj ˆφκ,j,
where Hb = dΓb(ω). This model is called the Nelson model (Nelson,
1964). One usually assumes the following:
(N) The Schr¨odinger operator Hp is self-adjoint and bounded from below.7
7For self-adjointness of Schr¨odinger operators, see, for example, Reed and Simon (1975).
916
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem
14.3. Under assumption (N), HN(κ) is self-adjoint
with
D(HN(κ)) = D(Hp) ∩D(Hb) and bounded from below.
Proof. Let HI := N
j=1 gj ˆφκ,j. Then, it follows from the proof of Theorem
14.2 that D(Hb) ⊂D(HI) and, for any ε > 0, there exists a constant cε > 0
such that
∥HIΨ∥≤ε∥HbΨ∥+ cε∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(Hb).
Since Hp is self-adjoint, bounded from below and Hb ≥0, it follows that
H0 := Hp + Hb is self-adjoint and bounded from below. In particular, H0
is closed. Therefore, by Theorem 1.6, there exists a constant C > 0
∥HpΨ∥+ ∥HbΨ∥≤C(∥H0Ψ∥+ ∥Ψ∥),
Ψ ∈D(H0).
Hence,
∥HIΨ∥≤εC∥H0Ψ∥+ (cε + εC)∥Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(H0).
Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, it follows from the Kato–Rellich theorem that
HN(κ) = H0 + HI is self-adjoint with D(HN(κ)) = D(H0) and bounded
from below.
□
Nelson (1964) proved that, in the case where m > 0, d = 3 and V = 0,
the ultraviolet cutoﬀκ can be removed in the following sense: there exist
a constant Eκ ∈R (this is explicitly given) and a self-adjoint operator H∞
on
 ⊕
(R3)N Fb(L2(R3))dx such that Eκ →−∞(κ →∞) and
s- lim
κ→∞e−it(HN(κ)−Eκ) = e−itH∞,
t ∈R.
(14.22)
This is a surprising result because it shows that the removal of the
ultraviolet cutoﬀκ can be carried out within the same Hilbert space, while,
in a conventional heuristic picture, the removal of the ultraviolet cutoﬀ
may change the Hilbert space of the representation of CCR (recall, for
example, the case of the vHM model discussed in Chapter 13). Nelson’s
result also shows the importance of the topology of convergence for the
nets of (unbounded) operators.8 Note also that (14.22) is equivalent to the
8In the present case, the strong convergence of one-parameter unitary groups. It is easy
to see that, for all f ∈L2((R3)N) with ∥f∥= 1,

f ⊗ΩL2(R3), (HN(κ) −Eκ)f ⊗ΩL2(R3)

Hence, in the weak topology, {HN(κ) −Eκ}κ does not converge.
Models in QFT
917
strong resolvent convergence of {HN(κ) −Eκ}κ to H∞as κ →∞, i.e.,
limκ→∞(HN(κ) −Eκ −z)−1 = (H∞−z)−1, z ∈C \ R (see, for example,
Reed and Simon, 1980, Theorem VIII.21). A reﬁned analysis of the Nelson
model was given by Cannon (1971).
It is immediately apparent from Nelson’s paper (Nelson, 1964) that
(14.22) also holds in the case where m > 0, d = 1, 2, 3 and V belongs to a
suitable class of functions. For further developments on the removal of the
ultraviolet cutoﬀ(ultraviolet renormalization) in the Nelson model, see, for
example, G´erard et al. (2012), Gubinelli et al. (2014), Miyao (2019), and
Hiroshima and Matte (2022).
As in the case of other models, the existence of a ground state of HN(κ)
has been discussed, mainly in the massless case of m = 0 (Bach et al.,
1998b; G´erard, 2000; Hiroshima and Sasaki, 2008; Spohn, 1998). In the
massive case of m > 0, it is not so diﬃcult to show the existence and
uniqueness of a ground state of HN(κ) under a suitable condition for V
because, in this case, one can employ the method of constructive quantum
ﬁeld theory (Glimm and Jaﬀe, 1968b, 1970, 1985, 1987; Gross, 1972). But,
in the massless case of m = 0, infrared problems may occur, as mentioned
in the case of the massless vHM model in Chapter 13 (for a pioneering
work on this aspect, see Fr¨ohlich, 1973, 1974). In fact, it is shown that, in
the case d = 3 and N = 1, HN(κ) without infrared cutoﬀhas no ground
state (L¨orinczi et al., 2002a). But, if one uses a non-Fock representation for
the time-zero ﬁeld and its canonical conjugate momentum, one can show
that the Hamiltonian without infrared cutoﬀin this representation has a
ground state (Arai, 2001b; L¨orinczi et al., 2002b). This shows that, in the
Nelson model, the existence of a ground state depends on the choice of rep-
resentations of the time-zero ﬁeld and its canonical conjugate momentum
(we have seen this kind of phenomena in the vHM model in Chapter 13).
Sasaki (2005a) extended the result to the case where V is in a more general
class of functions. Also, the existence of a ground state of the renormalized
Hamiltonian H∞without infrared cutoﬀhas been shown in Hirokawa et al.
(2005). For a general mathematical formulation on the absence of ground
states, see Arai et al. (1999).
14.5.2
Pauli–Fierz model in non-relativistic QED
We consider a quantum system of a non-relativistic spin-less charged
particle with charge q and mass M > 0 (typically, a non-relativistic electron
with spin degree excluded) interacting with the quantum radiation ﬁeld in
918
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
the d-dimensional space Rd with d ≥2. A Hilbert space for the system is
taken to be
FPF := L2(Rd) ⊗Frad,
where Frad is the boson Fock space for the quantum radiation ﬁeld (see
(11.17)). As in the case of the Nelson model, we use the identiﬁcation
FPF =
	 ⊕
Rd Fraddx.
We denote the d-dimensional version of the quantum radiation ﬁeld
Aκ
j (x) (j = 1, . . . , d) with an ultraviolet cutoﬀκ > 0 (see (14.21)) by the
same symbol. Since Aκ
j (·) : Rd →L(Frad) is a self-adjoint mapping, the
direct integral operator
ˆAj,κ :=
	 ⊕
Rd Aκ
j (x)dx.
is self-adjoint.
Suppose in addition that the charged particle is in a potential V : Rd →
R, which is Borel measurable and a.e. ﬁnite. Then, a Hamiltonian of such
a quantum system is deﬁned by
HPF :=
d

j=1
1
2M (ˆpj −q ˆAj,κ)2 + V + Hrad,
(14.23)
where ˆpj := −iDj (the jth momentum operator) and Hrad is the free Hamil-
tonian of the quantum radiation ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge (see (11.34)).
This model is called the Pauli–Fierz model for a spin-less charged particle
with an ultraviolet cutoﬀκ (Pauli and Fierz, 1938) (originally d = 3).
It is easy to see that the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (14.23) can
be expanded as
DPF := D(Δ) ∩D(V ) ∩D(Hrad) ∩[∩d
j=1D(ˆpj ˆAj,κ) ∩D( ˆAj,κˆpj) ∩D( ˆA2

j=1 ˆAj,κpj on
DPF, which follows from the Coulomb gauge condition k · e(r)(k) = 0,
k ∈Rd \ {0}, r = 1, . . . , d −1 (Problem 7). Concerning the self-adjointness
Models in QFT
919
of HPF, we present only a result in the small coupling case (i.e., the case
where |q| is suﬃciently small). Let
HS(V ) := −1
2M Δ + V,
which is a Schr¨odinger operator.
Theorem 14.4. Suppose that HS(V ) is self-adjoint and bounded from
below. Then, there exists a constant q0 > 0 such that, for all |q| < q0,
HPF is self-adjoint and bounded from below with D(HPF) = D(HS(V )) ∩
D(Hrad).
Proof. We can write HPF = HPF,0 + Hint on DPF, where
HPF,0 := HS(V ) + Hrad = −1
2M Δ + Hrad + V,
the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the model, and
Hint := −q

Under the present assumption, we can assume that HS(V ) ≥0 without loss
of generality.9 Then, HPF,0 ≥0. Hence,
∥Ψ∥≤∥(HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(HPF,0).
It follows from an application of Theorem 1.6 that there exists a constant
C > 0 such that

Ψ ∈D(HPF,0).
By an application of Proposition 5.16(iii), there exists a constant cj(κ) > 0
such that, for all Ψ ∈D(Hrad), ∥ˆA2
j,κΨ∥≤cj(κ)∥(Hrad + 1)Ψ∥. Hence,
∥ˆA2
j,κΨ∥≤cj(κ)(C∥HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥+ ∥Ψ∥), Ψ ∈D(HPF,0).
9If it is not the case, then one needs only to replace HS(V ) with HS(V )′ := HS(V ) −
inf σ(HS(V )) ≥0 so that HS(V ) = HS(V )′ + inf σ(HS(V )).

Therefore, DPF = D(HPF,0), and there exist positive constants a and b
depending on κ such that
∥HintΨ∥≤(a|q| + b|q|2)∥(HPF,0 + 1)Ψ∥.
Let q0 := (−a +
√
a2 + 4b)/2b > 0. Then, (a|q| + b|q|2) < 1 for all |q| < q0.
Hence, for all |q| < q0, we can apply the Kato–Rellich theorem to conclude
that HPF ↾D(HPF,0) is self-adjoint and bounded from below. Since a self-
adjoint operator has no non-trivial symmetric extension, HPF is self-adjoint
with D(HPF) = D(HPF,0) and bounded from below.
□
By using other methods, one can show that, for all q ∈R, HPF is
self-adjoint and bounded from below for a class of V . This result can be
extended to a many-particle system interacting with the quantum radiation
ﬁeld. For the details, see Hiroshima (2000), Hasler and Herbst (2008), and
Falconi (2015).
The Pauli–Fierz-type models have been extensively studied. Blanchard
(1969) may be the ﬁrst who studied the infrared problem of the Pauli–Fierz
model Hdipole in the dipole approximation (i.e., Hdipole is the operator HPF
with ˆAj,κ replaced by Aκ
j (0)). Arai (1983a) gave the ﬁrst complete analysis
of the model Hdipole in the case where d = 3 and V (x) = Mω0x2/2 (a har-
monic oscillator potential; ω0 > 0 is a constant), including the existence of
a ground state without an infrared cutoﬀand of resonances, the identiﬁca-
tion of the spectra of the Hamiltonian, scattering theory and the removal of
the ultraviolet cutoﬀ. See also Arai (1983b), where the Compton scattering
Models in QFT
921
in the dipole approximation is investigated with the need of electron mass
renormalization. A scaling limit on Hdipole is considered in Arai (1990) to
obtain an eﬀective quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. For the model Hdipole
with a general class of V , the asymptotic completeness for Rayleigh scat-
tering was proved by Spohn (1997).
The existence of a ground state of the original Pauli–Fierz model
without infrared cutoﬀwas shown in Griesemer et al. (2001). Related stud-
ies are found in, for example, Hiroshima and Spohn (2001), Hiroshima
(2001), Lieb and Loss (2003), Loss et al. (2007), Hiroshima (2007) and
Hiroshima and L¨orinczi (2008). For reviews on mathematical analysis of
non-relativistic QED and related topics, see, for example, Derezi´nski and
Siedentop (2006) and Hiroshima (2004, 2019). There are semi-relativistic
versions of the Pauli–Fierz model (Miyao and Spohn, 2009; Hiroshima,
2011, 2014; K¨onenberg et al., 2011; Hidaka and Hiroshima, 2016; Hidaka
et al., 2021).
There are investigations of non-relativistic QED using non-Coulomb
gauge and indeﬁnite metric Hilbert space (Suzuki, 2008; Hiroshima and
Suzuki, 2009) (recall Remark 11.1).
An interesting (but diﬃcult) open problem involving the Pauli–Fierz
model is to remove the ultraviolet cutoﬀ, where an inﬁnite mass renormal-
ization may be necessary (see, for example, Hainzl and Seiringer, 2002; Lieb
and Loss, 2002; Hiroshima and Spohn, 2005; Hiroshima and Ito, 2007).
14.5.3
Generalized spin-boson model
One can consider a general quantum system S interacting with a Bose ﬁeld
acting in the abstract boson Fock space Fb(Hb) over a Hilbert space Hb
(a one-particle Hilbert space). The Hilbert space for the composite system
is given by
FGSB := HS ⊗Fb(Hb),
where HS is a Hilbert space for the quantum system S. We denote by HS
the Hamiltonian of the quantum system S which is a self-adjoint operator
on HS and by hb the one-particle Hamiltonian of the Bose ﬁeld which is
a non-negative and injective self-adjoint operator on Hb. We suppose that
the interaction between the quantum system S and the Bose ﬁeld is given
by an operator of the form
HI(B, g) :=
J

j=1
Bj ⊗ΦS(gj),
922
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
where, J ∈N, Bj is a symmetric operator on HS and ΦS(gj) is the Segal
ﬁeld operator with test vector gj ∈Hb (we set B = (B1, . . . , BJ), g :=
(g1, . . . , gJ)). Then, the total Hamiltonian of the interacting system is
given by
HGSB := HS ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb) + HI(B, g).
This model is called a generalized spin-boson (GSB) model (Arai and
Hirokawa, 1997), which covers a range of particle–boson interaction models
(for recent studies on the GSB model, see, for example, Takaesu, 2010;
Teranishi, 2015, 2018; Lonigro, 2022).
Example 14.1. The standard spin-boson model is realized by taking
(HS, HS, Hb, hb, B, g) as follows:
HS = C2,
HS = μ
2 σ1 (μ > 0),
Hb = L2(Rd
k),
hb = ω,
J = 1,
B1 = σ3,
g1 = g ∈L2(Rd
k) (g∗= g),
where σ1 and σ3 are two of the Pauli matrices (see (12.2)) and ω is a
non-negative Borel measurable function on Rd
k. Hence, HGSB in this case
takes the form
HSB = μ
2 σ1 ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(ω) + σ3 ⊗ΦS(g).
This model is used as a model of an atom with two energy levels whose gap
is μ, interacting with a photon ﬁeld (in this case, ω(k) = |k|, k ∈Rd). There
are many articles on the spin-boson model. See, for example, Fannes et al.
(1988), Spohn (1989), Arai (1990), Arai and Hirokawa (1996), Hirokawa
(1999), Bach et al. (2017), De Roecka et al. (2015), Hasler and Herbst
(2011), Hirokawa et al. (2014), Hasler (2021, 2022) and references therein.
14.5.4
Pauli–Fierz Hamiltonian
Derezi´nski and G´erard (1999) introduced a
uniﬁed version of the
Nelson-type model and the GSB model in an abstract form, as shown in
the following. We continue to use the notation in the preceding section. To
deﬁne the model, it is easier to employ the natural identiﬁcation
FGSB = ⊕∞
n=0Fn,
Fn := HS ⊗(⊗n
s Hb)
Models in QFT
923
so that each vector Ψ ∈FGSB is represented as Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0, with
Ψ (n) ∈Fn satisfying
∞

n=0
∥Ψ (n)∥2 < ∞.
Let v be a densely deﬁned closed operator from HS to HS ⊗Hb. Then,
one can deﬁne a linear operator a∗(v) on FGSB as follows:
D (a∗(v)) :=

Ψ = {Ψ (n)}∞
n=0 ∈FGSB
Ψ (n−1) ∈D (v ⊗I) , n ≥1,
∞

n=0
∥√n(I ⊗Sn)(v ⊗I)Ψ (n−1)∥2 < ∞

,
(a∗(v)Ψ)(0) := 0,
(a∗(v)Ψ)(n) := √n(I ⊗Sn)(v ⊗I)Ψ (n−1), n ≥1, Ψ ∈D(a∗(v)).
Note that (v ⊗I)Ψ (n−1) ∈HS ⊗

Hb ⊗(⊗n−1
s


.
Remark 14.5. In Derezi´nski and G´erard (1999), a∗(v) is deﬁned only in
the case where v is bounded with D(v) = HS. But, as far as the deﬁnition
of a∗(v) is concerned, the boundedness of v is not necessary, as just shown
above.
The operator a∗(v) is an extended version of the creation operator A(f)∗
on Fb(Hb). Indeed, for a vector f ∈Hb and a densely deﬁned closed
operator B on HS, one deﬁnes a linear operator vf,B ∈L(HS, HS ⊗Hb)
by vf,B(u) := Bu ⊗f, u ∈D(B) ⊂HS. Then, it is easy to see
a∗(vf,B) = B ⊗A(f)∗.
on D(B)ˆ⊗D(A(f)∗).
The adjoint
a(v) := (a∗(v))∗
(14.24)
of a∗(v) gives an extended version of the annihilation operator A(f) (f ∈
Hb). An analogue of the Segal ﬁeld operator is deﬁned by
φ(v) :=
1
√
2(a∗(v) + a(v)).
(14.25)
924
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
A generalization of the Hamiltonian HGSB is given by
HDG := HS ⊗I + I ⊗dΓb(hb) + φ(v),
which is called a Pauli–Fierz Hamiltonian (Derezi´nski and G´erard,
1999). For recent studies on Pauli–Fierz Hamiltonians and related subjects,
see, for example, Møller (2014) and references therein.
14.5.5
A particle–ﬁeld interaction model in relativistic
QED
One can consider also a system of a Dirac particle interacting with the
quantum radiation ﬁeld. A Hilbert space for such a system is taken to be
FDM := L2(R3; C4) ⊗Frad =
	 ⊕
R3 ⊕4Fraddx.
We denote the mass and charge of the Dirac particle by M > 0 and q ∈R,
respectively. Then, a natural total Hamiltonian is given by
HDM :=
3

j=1
αj(ˆpj −q ˆAj,κ) + βM + V + Hrad.
where V
=
(Vij)i,j=1,2,3,4 (Vij
:
R3
→
C ∪{±∞}) is a 4 × 4
Hermitian matrix-valued function on R3. The operator HDM is called
a Dirac–Maxwell
operator, or a Dirac–Maxwell
Hamiltonian
(Arai, 2001a).10
It is shown (Arai, 2001a) that, for a class of V , HDM is essentially
self-adjoint but unbounded from above and below. In the sense that it is
not bounded from below, HDM may be unphysical.11 But, for some physical
phenomena such as the Lamb shift (a very ﬁne energy-level shift observed at
the ﬁrst excited state of the hydrogen atom (Kinoshita, 1990), which cannot
be explained in terms of the Dirac operator 3
j=1 αj(−iDj)+βM +V , with
V (x) = −e2/(4πε0|x|) being the Coulomb potential (e > 0 is the funda-
mental electric charge)) and the Compton scattering (an elastic scattering
of an electron with a photon), the model explains them to some extent,
although the explanations are based on formal perturbation theories (see,
10Pauli introduced the formal Hamiltonian for HDM with V = 0 in 1933 (Pauli, 1980,
(26.9)). It is cited in Bloch and Nordsieck (1937).
11In the standard picture in quantum theory, the boundedness from below of a Hamil-
tonian H is necessary for the stability of the quantum system described by H.
Models in QFT
925
for example, Nishijima, 1973). On the mathematical side, it is shown that
HDM has a non-relativistic limit in the sense of strong resolvent conver-
gence, which yields the Hamiltonian of the Pauli–Fierz model with spin
1/2 in non-relativistic QED (Arai, 2003, 2006a). These facts suggest that,
in a range of physical phenomena, the model may be physical. Hence, what
is important will be to clarify in what sense or in what range of physi-
cal phenomena the model is physical without invoking formal perturbation
theories.
The operator HDM may be interesting also from a purely operator-
theoretical point of view because HDM is made of objects in a representation
({α1, α2, α3, β}, {ˆqj, ˆpj}3
j=1, {a(r)(f), a(r)(f)∗|r = 1, 2, f ∈L2(R3)}) of the
Cliﬀord algebra associated with R4 and CCR, where ˆqj is the multiplication
operator by the jth variable xj (x = (x1, x2, x3) ∈R3). For recent studies
on HDM, see, for example, Futakuchi and Usui (2014b), Stockmeyer and
Zenk (2008), and Sasaki (2005b, 2014).

electron, φκ(x) is a phonon ﬁeld with gκ,0 replaced by a suitable function
g ∈L2(Rd
k) and ω is replaced by a suitable function (typically, ω is a constant
function). In this case, H describes a polaron which is a composite particle
of the electron and a cloud of the phonons. Let E(p) be the lowest energy of
H(p): E(p) = inf σ(H(p)). If there exists a constant M ∗> 0 such that
E(p) −E(0) =

then M ∗is called the eﬀective mass of the polaron. It is an important prob-

Mathematical Formulation of
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
We present an introduction to a mathematical theory of spontaneous symmetry
breaking, which is an important subject in QFT.
15.1
∗-Algebras and Representations
An axiomatic approach to symmetry aspects in QFT is given by an alge-
braic formulation of quantum physics. In this formulation, the concept of
∗-algebra plays a fundamental role. For this reason, we ﬁrst review basic
part of the theory of ∗-algebras.
15.1.1
∗-algebras
For each Hilbert space H , one has the Banach space B(H ) of everywhere
deﬁned bounded linear operators on H . It follows that B(H ) becomes an
algebra1 with product operation being the operator product. In addition
to the algebraic operations, B(H ) has another operation which, to each
A ∈B(H ), assigns its adjoint A∗. This operation is called the conjugate
operation and obeys the following laws: for all A, B ∈B(H ) and α, β ∈C,
(A∗)∗= A∗, (αA + βB)∗= α∗A∗+ β∗B∗and (AB)∗= B∗A∗. These
structures of B(H ) are brought into an abstract form to give a general
concept.
Deﬁnition 15.1. A set A is called a ∗-algebra if it is an algebra with a
mapping A ∋A →A∗∈A such that, for all A, B ∈A, α, β ∈C,
(A∗)∗= A,
(αA + βB)∗= α∗A∗+ β∗B∗,
(AB)∗= B∗A∗.
1See footnote right before Lemma 5.17.
929
930
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
The element A∗∈A corresponding to A ∈A is called the conjugate
element of A. The mapping A ∋A →A∗∈A is called the ∗-operation
on A.
A ∗-algebra with unit element is called a unital ∗-algebra.
We say that an element A ∈A is self-adjoint if A∗= A.
Proposition 15.1. Let A be a unital ∗-algebra.
(i) The unit element I ∈A is self-adjoint, i.e., I∗= I.
(ii) For each A ∈A, there exists a unique pair (A1, A2) of self-adjoint
elements in A such that
A = A1 + iA2.
(15.1)
Proof. (i) We have I∗= II∗. Hence, I = (II∗)∗= II∗= I∗.
(ii) Let
A1 := 1
2(A + A∗) ∈A,
A2 := 1
2i(A −A∗) ∈A.
Then, it is easy to see that A1 and A2 are self-adjoint and (15.1) holds.
To prove the uniqueness of (A1, A2) in (15.1), let A = B1 + iB2 with
self-adjoint elements B1 and B2 in A. Then, A1 −B1 = i(B2 −A2). Tak-
ing the ∗-operation on this equation, we have A1 −B1 = −i(B2 −A2).
Hence, it follows that A1 −B1 = 0 and B2 −A2 = 0. Thus, B1 = A1 and
B2 = A2.
□
The self-adjoint element A1 (resp., A2) in (15.1) is called the real
(resp., imaginary) part of A.
Remark 15.1. In general, for a unital algebra A, a mapping ι : A →A is
called an involution on A if ι(I) = I, ι(ι(A)) = A and ι(AB) = ι(B)ι(A),
for all A, B ∈A. The ∗-operation on A is an involution on A.
In what follows, for convenience, we mean by ∗-algebra a unital ∗-algebra
unless otherwise stated.
Example 15.1. As we have seen above, B(H ) is a ∗-algebra, with ∗-
operation being the conjugate operation.
Deﬁnition 15.2. A subset M of a ∗-algebra A is called a ∗-subalgebra
of A if it is a ∗-algebra with the algebraic and the ∗-operations of A.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
931
With regard to existence of ∗-subalgebra, we have the following.
Lemma 15.1. Let D0 be a non-empty subset of a ∗-algebra A. Then, there
exists a unique ∗-subalgebra D such that D0 ⊂D and, if M is a ∗-subalgebra
of A satisfying D0 ⊂M, then D ⊂M.
Proof. Let S be the set of all ∗-subalgebra including D0. Then, since
A ∈S , S is not empty. Hence, D := ∩M∈S M is a non-empty subset of A.
It is easy to check that D is the desired ∗-subalgebra.
□
The ∗-subalgebra D in Lemma 15.1 is the smallest ∗-subalgebra includ-
ing D0. We call D the ∗-algebra generated by D0. The elements of D0
are called the generators of D.
There are some notions of mappings from a ∗-algebra to a ∗-algebra.
Deﬁnition 15.3. Let A and B be ∗-algebras. A mapping φ : A →B is
called a ∗-homomorphism if
φ(αA + βB) = αφ(A) + βφ(B),
φ(AB) = φ(A)φ(B),
φ(A)∗= φ(A∗),
A, B ∈A, α, β ∈C.
A bijective ∗-homomorphism is called a ∗-isomorphism. In particular,
a ∗-isomorphism from A to A is called a ∗-automorphism on A.
As
is
easily
seen,
the
inverse
of
a
∗-automorphism is
also
a
∗-automorphism. Hence, the following deﬁnition has mathematical mean-
ing: two ∗-algebras A and B are said to be ∗-isomorphic if there exists a
∗-isomorphism from A to B.
Let φ1, φ2 : A →A be ∗-automorphisms. Then, it is easy to see that
the product φ1φ2 := φ1 ◦φ2 (the composite mapping2 of φ2 and φ1) is also
a ∗-automorphism on A and the set of all ∗-automorphisms on A forms a
group with this product operation. The group, denoted ∗-Aut(A), is called
the ∗-automorphism group on A.
Proposition 15.2. Let φ be a ∗-automorphism on A. Then, φ(I) = I.
Proof. For all A ∈A, we have φ(A)φ(I) = φ(AI) = φ(A) and φ(I)φ(A) =
φ(IA) = φ(A). Since φ is surjective, this implies that, for all A ∈A,
Aφ(I) = φ(I)A = A. Hence, φ(I) = I.

15.1.2
C∗-algebra and von Neumann algebra
The concept of ∗-algebra is purely algebraic. But there exist ∗-algebras
which
have
topological
structures,
such
as
the
∗-algebra
B(H )
(Example 15.1) is a Banach space with respect to operator norm. In this
section, we introduce two topological ∗-algebras.
Deﬁnition 15.4. A ∗-algebra A is called a C∗-algebra if it is a Banach
space with a norm ∥· ∥on A such that, for all A, B ∈A,
(i) ∥AB∥≤∥A∥∥B∥,
(ii) ∥A∗∥= ∥A∥,
(iii) ∥A∗A∥= ∥A∥2.
A ∗-subalgebra M of a C∗-algebra A is called a C∗-subalgebra of A if
M is a C∗-algebra with respect to the norm of A.
Example 15.2. The ∗-algebra B(H ) is a C∗-algebra with operator norm.
A C∗-subalgebra of B(H ) is called a concrete C∗-algebra.
Let H be a Hilbert space and L(H ) be the set of all linear operators
on H as before. Let L be a non-empty subset of L(H ) and L′ be the
commutant of L (see (5.68)).
Lemma 15.2. If L is ∗-invariant,3 then L′ is a ∗-subalgebra of B(H ).
Proof. We need only to prove that, for each B ∈L′, B∗∈L′. Under the
present assumption, for all T ∈L, BT ∗⊂T ∗B. Hence, (T ∗B)∗⊂(BT ∗)∗.
We have (T ∗B)∗⊃B∗T ∗∗= B∗T and (BT ∗)∗= T ∗∗B∗= T B∗(note that
B is bounded). Hence, B∗T ⊂T B∗. Thus, B∗∈L′.
□
Since L′ is a non-empty subset of B(H ) and hence of L(H ), the com-
mutant of L′
L′′ := (L′)′ = {A ∈B(H )|AB = BA, B ∈L′}
(15.2)
is deﬁned. The subalgebra L′′ is called the the double commutant of L.
Let N be a ∗-subalgebra of B(H ). Then, by Lemma 15.2, N′ is a
∗-subalgebra of B(H ). Hence, so is N′′. Therefore, the following deﬁnition
is possible.
Deﬁnition 15.5. A ∗-subalgebra N of B(H ) satisfying N′′ = N is called
a von Neumann algebra.
3See the paragraph right after the proof of Lemma 5.8.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
933
Remark 15.2. Let N be a ∗-subalgebra of B(H ). Then, the following
conditions are equivalent:
(i) N is a von Neumann algebra.
(ii) I ∈N and N is strongly closed, i.e., N is closed in the strong operator
topology on B(H ) (see Remark 1.6 (ii)).
(iii) I ∈N and N is weakly closed, i.e., N is closed in the weak operator
topology on B(H ) (see Remark 1.6 (iii)).
For a proof of this theorem, see Bratteli and Robinson (1979), Theo-
rem 2.4.11. There are authors who use (ii) or (iii) as the deﬁnition of a
von Neumann algebra.
Proposition 15.3. A von Neumann algebra is a C∗-algebra in the operator
norm topology.
Proof. Let N be a von Neumann algebra. We need only to prove the
completeness of N in the uniform topology (operator norm topology). Let
{An}∞
n=1 with An ∈N ⊂B(H ) (n ∈N) be a Cauchy sequence in operator
norm, i.e., ∥An −Am∥→0 (n, m →∞). By the completeness of B(H ),
there exists an operator A ∈B(H ) such that ∥An −A∥→0 (n →∞).
Since An ∈N = N′′, we have AnB = BAn for all B ∈N′. Taking the limit
n →∞in this equation (in the uniform topology), we obtain AB = BA.
Hence, A ∈N′′. Therefore, A ∈N. Thus, N is complete in the uniform
topology.

O∗-algebra
For a dense subspace D of H , we deﬁne a subset of L(H ):
L(D) := {X ∈L(H )|D(X) = D, Ran(X) ⊂D}.
Since D is dense in H , each element X in L(D) is densely deﬁned. Hence,
X∗exists. But D(X∗) does not necessarily include D, and even in the
case where D ⊂D(X∗), it does not necessarily hold that Ran(X∗↾D)
⊂D. Taking these matters into account, we introduce the following set of
operators:
L†(D) := {X ∈L(D)|D ⊂D(X∗), X∗D ⊂D}.
(15.3)
For each X ∈L†(D), X∗is densely deﬁned, and hence X is closable.
The set L†(D) becomes a vector space with addition and scalar multipli-
cation for linear operators, where the zero-vector is 0D, the zero-operator

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
restricted to D. Moreover, letting X† := X∗↾D for X ∈L†(D), L†(D)
becomes a ∗-algebra, with the ∗-operation deﬁned by X →X† (the restric-
tion ID of the identity on H is the identity in L†(D)). The ∗-algebra L†(D)
is called the O∗-algebra associated with D. For a general theory of
O∗-algebra, see Inoue (1988) and Schm¨udgen (1990).
Remark 15.3. In the case where D = H , each X ∈L†(H ) satisﬁes
D(X) = H and D(X∗) = H , which imply that X = (X∗)∗. Hence, X
is a closed operator. Then, according to the closed graph theorem, X is
bounded. Thus, L†(H ) = B(H ).
15.1.4
States on ∗-algebras
Let A be a ∗-algebra. We denote by A∗the set of linear functionals on A
(the algebraic dual space of A):
A∗:= {φ : A →C|φ is linear}.
The set A∗becomes a complex vector space with addition and scalar mul-
tiplication of linear functionals.
An element ω ∈A∗is called a positive linear functional on A if it
satisﬁes the positivity condition
ω(A∗A) ≥0,
A ∈A.
The basic properties of a positive linear functional are described in the
following proposition.
Proposition 15.4. Let ω be a positive linear functional on A.
(i) For all A ∈A,
ω(A)∗= ω(A∗).
(15.4)
In particular, if A is self-adjoint, then ω(A) is a real number.
(ii) (Schwarz inequality) For all A, B ∈A,
|ω(A∗B)| ≤ω(A∗A)1/2ω(B∗B)1/2.
(15.5)
(iii) If ω ̸= 0, then ω(I) > 0.
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that, if A is a self-adjoint element in A, then ω(A)
is a real number. Let A ∈A be self-adjoint. Then, by the positivity of ω,
ω((I + A)∗(I + A)) ≥0. Since A and I are self-adjoint, we have
(I + A)∗(I + A) = (I + A)2 = I + 2A + A2.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
935
Hence, ω(I) + 2ω(A) + ω(A2) ≥0. Note that
ω(I) = ω(I∗I) ≥0
(15.6)
and ω(A2) = ω(A∗A) ≥0. Therefore ω(A) is a real number.
We next consider the case where A is any element in A. Then, by
(15.1), we have ω(A) = ω(A1) + iω(A2). By the preceding result, ω(Aj)∗=
ω(Aj), j = 1, 2. Hence,
ω(A)∗= ω(A1) −iω(A2) = ω(A1 −iA2) = ω(A∗).
Thus, (15.4) holds.
(ii) For all z ∈C, ω((A + zB)∗(A + zB)) ≥0. Hence,
ω(A∗A) + zω(A∗B) + z∗ω(B∗A) + |z|2ω(B∗B) ≥0.
By (15.4), we have ω(B∗A) = ω(A∗B)∗. Using the polar form for complex
numbers, we have ω(A∗B) = |ω(A∗B)|eiθ with some θ ∈R. Take z = xe−iθ
with x ∈R arbitrary. Then, we have
ω(A∗A) + 2x|ω(A∗B)| + x2ω(B∗B) ≥0.
Since x is an arbitrary real number, it follows that
|ω(A∗B)|2 ≤ω(A∗A)ω(B∗B).
Thus, (15.5) holds.
(iii) Since ω ̸= 0, there exists an element A ∈A such that ω(A) ̸= 0.
Then, by (15.4), ω(A∗) ̸= 0. By taking B = I in (15.5), we have 0 <
|ω(A∗)| ≤ω(A∗A)1/2ω(I)1/2. This implies that ω(I) ̸= 0.
□
An important class of positive linear functionals on A is deﬁned as
follows.
Deﬁnition 15.6. A positive linear functional ω on A is called a state on
A if it satisﬁes the normalization condition ω(I) = 1. We denote by EA
the set of all states on A. It is called the state space on A.
By Proposition 15.4 (iii), for each non-zero positive linear functional ω
on A, one can deﬁne a positive linear functional ω on A by
ω :=
1
ω(I)ω.
It is obvious that ω(I) = 1. Hence, ω is a state on A, i.e., ω ∈EA. We call ω
the normalization of ω. Thus, to each non-zero positive linear functional
on A, there corresponds a state on A.
936
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
It is easy to see that, for non-zero positive linear functionals ω1 and
ω2 on A, ω1 = ω2 if and only if there is a constant α > 0 such that
ω1 = αω2.
Proposition 15.5. The set EA is a convex set, i.e., for all ω1, ω2 ∈EA and
λ ∈(0, 1) λω1 + (1 −λ)ω2 ∈EA.
Based on Proposition 15.5, we deﬁne a notion on state: a state ω ∈EA
is called a mixed state if there are two diﬀerent states ω1, ω2 ∈EA and
λ ∈(0, 1) such that ω = λω1 + (1 −λ)ω2. In this case, ω is said to be a
non-trivial mixture of ω1 and ω2. A state is said to be a pure state if
it is not a mixed state.
Example 15.3. Let L†(D) be the O∗-algebra associated with a subspace
D dense in a Hilbert space H (see Section 15.1.3) and M be a ∗-subalgebra
of L†(D) with ID ∈M. For each unit vector Ψ ∈D, a mapping ωΨ : M →C
is deﬁned by
ωΨ(A) := ⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩,
A ∈M.
It is easy to check that ωΨ is a state on M. The state ωΨ is called the vector
state deﬁned by Ψ. A vector state on M is deﬁned to be a state ω on M
such that ω = ωΨ, for some Ψ ∈D.
Let us prove the following fact:
• For all unit vectors Ψ ∈D, the vector state ωΨ on L†(D) is a pure state.
Proof. We prove the assertion by reduction to absurdity. Suppose that ωΨ
is not a pure state. Then, there are two diﬀerent states ω1, ω2 and λ ∈(0, 1)
such that ωΨ = λω1 + (1 −λ)ω2. Hence,
⟨Ψ, AΨ⟩= λω1(A) + (1 −λ)ω2(A),
A ∈L†(D).
(15.7)
Let PΨ be the orthogonal projection onto the one-dimensional subspace
K
:= {αΨ|α ∈C}. Then, for all Φ ∈H , PΨΦ = ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩Ψ. Hence,
PΨD ⊂D. Let P := PΨ ↾D. Then, P ∗= PΨ. Hence, it follows that
P ∈L†(D). The operator QΨ := I −PΨ is the orthogonal projection onto
K ⊥, the orthogonal complement of K . It follows that Q := QΨ ↾D is in
L†(D). Taking A = Q†Q in (15.7), we have
0 = λω1(Q†Q) + (1 −λ)ω2(Q†Q).
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
937
Since each term on the right-hand side is non-negative and 0 < λ < 1,
it follows that ω1(Q†Q) = 0 and ω2(Q†Q) = 0. For all A ∈L†(D), the
Schwarz inequality yields
|ωj(AQ)|2 ≤ωj(AA†)ωj(Q†Q) = 0,
j = 1, 2.
Hence, ωj(AQ) = 0. Similarly, ωj(QA) = 0. We have
PAP = (1 −Q)A(1 −Q) = A −AQ −QA + QAQ.
Hence, ωj(PAP) = ωj(A). On the other hand, one can show that, for
all Φ ∈H , PAPΦ = ωΨ(A)PΦ. Hence, PAP = ωΨ(A)P. Hence, ωj(A) =
ωΨ(A)ωj(P). Taking A = ID, we obtain ωj(P) = 1. Hence, ωj(A) = ωΨ(A).
Since A is an arbitrary element in L†(D), it follows that ωj = ω, j = 1, 2.
But this contradicts the assumption ω1 ̸= ω2. Thus, we arrive at a contra-
diction.
□
It follows from the fact just proved that any non-trivial mixture of two
vector states on L†(D) cannot be a vector state on L†(D).
Remark 15.4. Let M be a ∗-subalgebra of L†(D) with ID ∈M. Then, the
proof above shows that, if PΨ ↾D is an element in M, then ωΨ is a pure
state on M.
We remark that a vector state is not always a pure state; it depends on
the ∗-algebra under consideration.
Example 15.4. Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces and H := H1 ⊕H2 be
the direct sum Hilbert space of H1 and H2. It is easy to see that the direct
sum B(H1) ⊕B(H2) is a ∗-subalgebra of B(H ). Let Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2) ∈H
be a unit vector with Ψ1 ̸= 0 and Ψ2 ̸= 0. Then,
∥Ψ1∥2 + ∥Ψ2∥2 = 1,
0 < ∥Ψj∥2 < 1,
j = 1, 2.
Hence, letting λ := ∥Ψ1∥2, we have 0 < λ < 1 and ∥Ψ2∥2 = 1 −λ. We set
ˆΨj = ∥Ψj∥−1Ψj, j = 1, 2. Then, we have for all A1 ⊕A2 ∈B(H1) ⊕B(H2)
ωΨ(A1 ⊕A2) = ⟨Ψ1, A1Ψ1⟩+ ⟨Ψ2, A2Ψ2⟩
= λω( ˆΨ1,0)(A1 ⊕A2) + (1 −λ)ω(0, ˆΨ2)(A1 ⊕A2).
Hence,
ωΨ = λω( ˆΨ1,0) + (1 −λ)ω(0, ˆΨ2)
on B(H1) ⊕B(H1).
938
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Therefore, ωΨ as a vector state on B(H1) ⊕B(H1) is a mixed state of the
vector states ω( ˆΨ1,0) and ω(0, ˆΨ2) on B(H1) ⊕B(H1).
A positive linear functional on a C∗-algebra has strong properties.
Proposition 15.6. Let A be a C∗-algebra with norm ∥· ∥. Then:
(i) Every positive linear functional ω on A satisﬁes
|ω(A)| ≤ω(I)∥A∥,
A ∈A.
(15.8)
In particular, ω is bounded with
∥ω∥= ω(I).
(15.9)
(ii) For all A, B ∈A,
|ω(B∗AB)| ≤∥A∥ω(B∗B).
(15.10)
Proof. (i) For simplicity, we give a proof only in the case where A is a
concrete C∗-algebra, i.e., A is a C∗-subalgebra of B(H ) (see Example
15.2).4
Let A ∈A. Then, ∥A∥2 −A∗A ≥0. Hence, ∥A∥2ω(I) ≥ω(A∗A). By
this fact and Proposition 15.4(ii), we have
|ω(A)| = |ω(I∗A)| ≤ω(I)1/2ω(A∗A)1/2 ≤ω(I)∥A∥.
Hence, (15.8) follows.
By (15.8), we have ∥ω∥≤ω(I). On the other hand, ω(I) ≤∥ω∥∥I∥=
∥ω∥. Hence, (15.9) follows.
(ii) Let B be ﬁxed and deﬁne a mapping η : A →C by η(A) :=
ω(B∗AB). Then, η(A∗A) = ω((AB)∗AB) ≥0. Hence, η is a positive
linear functional on A. Applying (15.8) with ω replaced by η, we have
∥η(A)∥≤η(I)∥A∥. We have η(I) = ω(B∗B). Thus, (15.10) follows.

15.1.5
Representations of ∗-algebras
There is a concept concerning the realizations of a ∗-algebra as a ∗-algebra
consisting of linear operators on a Hilbert space.
4For the abstract C∗-algebra, one can develop a spectral theory in quite a parallel
way to the spectral theory of B(H ) (see, for example, Bratteli and Robinson, 1979,
Section 2.2 or Arai, 2008, Chapter 3). Then, the proof given as follows applies to the
case of the abstract C∗-algebra too.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
939
Deﬁnition 15.7. Let H be a Hilbert space and D be a dense subspace
of H . Let A be a ∗-algebra. A ∗-homomorphism π : A →L†(D) satisfying
π(I) = ID is called a ∗-representation, or simply a representation, of
A on H . We write D = D(π). The Hilbert space H is called a represen-
tation space of A. The triple (H , π, D(π)) is also called a representation
of A.
For a representation (H , π, D(π)) of a ∗-algebra A and a unitary oper-
ator U from H to a Hilbert space K , one can deﬁne
(UπU −1)(A) := Uπ(A)U −1,
A ∈A.
(15.11)
Then, it is easy to see that (K , UπU −1, UD(π)) is a representation of A.
This representation is called the unitary transform of the represen-
tation π by U. Hence, inﬁnitely many representations of A are associated
with a given representation of A.
In the case where D(π) = H in the representation (H , π, D(π)) of A,
it follows from Remark 15.3 that π is a ∗-homomorphism from A to B(H )
and hence, π(A) ∈B(H ), A ∈A. We call this type of representation a
bounded representation of A and write it (H , π).
We note the following fact.
Proposition 15.7. Let (H , π, D(π)) be a representation of a ∗-algebra A.
Suppose that, for each A ∈A, π(A) is bounded (hence, the closure π(A) of
π(A) is an element in B(H )). Deﬁne a mapping ¯π : A →B(H ) by
¯π(A) := π(A),
A ∈A.
Then, ¯π is a bounded representation of A.
Proof. The linearity of ¯π and the property ¯π(AB) = ¯π(A)¯π(B)(A, B ∈A)
are easy to prove.5 For each A ∈A, ¯π(A)∗= π(A)∗= π(A)† = π(A∗) =
¯π(A∗). Thus, ¯π is a ∗-homomorphism from A to B(H ).
□
A concept on equivalence between two representations of a ∗-algebra is
deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 15.8. Let (H1, π1, D(π1)) and (H2, π2, D(π2)) be two represen-
tations of a ∗-algebra A.
5Use the following facts: for densely deﬁned bounded linear operators T and S on a
Hilbert space, αT + βS = α ¯T + β ¯S, α, β ∈C and ST = ¯S ¯T.
940
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
(i) If there exists a unitary transformation U : H1 →H2 such that
Uπ1(A)U −1 = π2(A),
A ∈A,
(15.12)
then π1 is said to be unitarily equivalent (or equivalent) to π2.
(ii) The representation π1 is said to be inequivalent to π2 if π1 is not
unitarily equivalent to π2.
Remark 15.5. Operator equality (15.12) means that each π1(A) is unitar-
ily equivalent to π2(A) under the same unitary transformation U. It follows
that
UD(π1) = D(π2).
(15.13)
In Deﬁnition 5.2, we have introduced the concepts of reducibility and
irreducibility of a set of linear operators on a Hilbert space. They are used to
deﬁne the reducibility and irreducibility of a representation of a ∗-algebra.
Deﬁnition 15.9. A representation π of a ∗-algebra is said to be reducible
(resp., irreducible) if
π(A) := {π(A)|A ∈A}
(15.14)
is reducible (resp., irreducible).
Theorem 15.1. Let π of a representation of a ∗-algebra A such that
π(A)′ = CI. Then, π is irreducible.
Proof. We need only to apply Proposition 5.11(i) to the case where L =
π(A).
□
With regard to bounded representations of a ∗-algebra, we have the
following theorem.
Theorem 15.2. Let π be a bounded representation of a ∗-algebra A. Then,
π is irreducible if and only if π(A)′ = CI.
Proof. Suppose that π is irreducible. Since π is a bounded representation,
π(A)† = π(A)∗. Hence, π(A) is ∗-invariant. By this fact and Proposition
5.11(ii), π(A)′ = CI. The converse follows from Theorem 15.1.
□
Let A be a ∗-algebra and π be a representation of A. Then, for each
∗-automorphism α on A (i.e., α ∈∗-Aut(A)), a composite mapping π ◦α :
A →L†(D(π)) is deﬁned by
(π ◦α)(A) := π(α(A)),
A ∈A.
(15.15)
The following fact is easily proven.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
941
Lemma 15.3. The mapping π ◦α is a representation of A with D(π ◦α) =
D(π).
Theorem 15.3. If π(A)′ = CI, then (π ◦α)(A)′ = CI and the representa-
tion π ◦α is irreducible.
Proof. We set η := π ◦α. Let T
∈η(A)′. Then, for all A ∈A,
T η(A) ⊂η(A)T . Hence T π(α(A)) ⊂π(α(A))T . Since α is surjective, this
implies that T ∈π(A)′. Hence, there exists a number λ ∈C such that
T = λI. Therefore, η(A)′ = CI. By Theorem 15.1, this implies that η is
irreducible.
□
Theorems 15.3 and 15.2 yield the following.
Corollary 15.1. Let π be a bounded irreducible representation of a
∗-algebra A and α ∈∗-Aut(A). Then, so is π ◦α.
15.1.6
GNS representation
In this section, we show that each state of a ∗-algebra A deﬁnes, in a natural
way, a representation of A.
Let H be a Hilbert space and L be a set of linear operators on H
(i.e., L ⊂L(H )). A vector Ψ ∈H is called a cyclic vector for L if
Ψ ∈∩A∈LD(A) and the subspace generated by the set
LΨ := {AΨ|A ∈L}
(15.16)
is dense in H . If there exists a cyclic vector for L, then L is said to have a
cyclic vector.
Let (H , π, D(π)) be a representation of a ∗-algebra A. Then, for each
vector Ψ ∈D(π), π(A)Ψ = {π(A)Ψ|A ∈A} becomes a subspace of H .
If π(A) has a cyclic vector Ω ∈H and D(π) = π(A)Ω, then π is called
a cyclic representation of A with respect to Ω. We write it as (H , π, Ω).
The following theorem tells us that a state on A deﬁnes a cyclic repre-
sentation of A in a natural way.
Theorem 15.4. Let A be a ∗-algebra and ω be a state on A (i.e., ω ∈EA).
Then, there exist a Hilbert space Hω, a unit vector Ωω ∈Hω and a repre-
sentation πω of A on Hω such that (Hω, πω, Ωω) is a cyclic representation
of A and
ω(A) = ⟨Ωω, πω(A)Ωω⟩, A ∈A.
(15.17)
Proof. We divide the proof of this theorem into two steps.
942
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Step 1: Construction of Hω
For A, B ∈A, we deﬁne a complex number ⟨A, B⟩by
⟨A, B⟩:= ω(A∗B).
Then, it is easy to see that the following hold (A, B, B1, B2 ∈A, α1, α2 ∈C):
(a) (positivity) ⟨A, A⟩≥0; (b)(linearity) ⟨A, α1B1 + α2B2⟩= α1 ⟨A, B1⟩+
α2 ⟨A, B2⟩; (c) (Hermitian property) ⟨A, B⟩∗= ⟨B, A⟩. This means that the
mapping A × A ∋(A, B) →⟨A, B⟩is a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product
of A (see Section 2.1.2). Hence, we can apply Problem 1 in Chapter 2 to
construct a Hilbert space. Namely, we deﬁne some objects in the following
order:
(i) (null space)A0 := {A ∈A| ⟨A, A⟩= 0}.
(ii) (equivalence relation) A ∼B
def
⇐⇒A −B ∈A0 (A, B ∈A).
(iii) (equivalence class) [A] := {B ∈A|B ∼A}.
(iv) (quotient vector space)
Dω := A/A0 := {[A]|A ∈A}
(15.18)
with addition [A] + [B] := [A + B] and scalar multiplication α[A] :=
[αA] (A.B ∈A, α ∈C).
(v) (inner product)
⟨[A], [B]⟩:= ⟨A, B⟩,
[A], [B] ∈Dω.
The completion
Hω := Dω
(15.19)
of the inner product space Dω gives the Hilbert space we seek. By construc-
tion, Dω is regarded as a dense subspace of Hω.
Step 2: Construction of a representation
We deﬁne
Ωω := [I] ∈Dω.
Since ⟨[1], [1]⟩= ω(I∗I) = ω(I) = 1, Ωω is a unit vector: ∥Ωω∥= 1. For
each A ∈A, we deﬁne πω(A) : Dω →Dω by
πω(A)[X] := [AX],
[X] ∈Dω.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
943
It is easy to see that, if X ∼Y (X, Y ∈A), then AX ∼AY (use the
Schwarz inequality). Hence, the deﬁnition of πω(A) is well-deﬁned, i.e., it is
independent of the choice of representatives from [X]. It follows that πω(A)
is linear and
πω(A)Ωω = [A].
Hence,
Dω = πω(A)Ωω.
(15.20)
For all A, B ∈A,
πω(AB)[X] = [ABX] = πω(A)[BX] = πω(A)πω(B)[X],
[X] ∈Dω.
Hence,
πω(AB) = πω(A)πω(B).
For all [X], [Y ] ∈Dω, we have
⟨[Y ], πω(A)[X]⟩= ω(Y ∗AX) = ω(X∗A∗Y )∗= ⟨πω(A∗)[Y ], [X]⟩.
Hence, πω(A)∗⊃πω(A∗). Therefore, πω(A)† = πω(A∗). Thus, πω is a repre-
sentation of A. By (15.20), this representation is a cyclic representation with
respect to Ωω. Formula (15.17) immediately follows from the deﬁnitions of
the inner product, Ωω and πω.
□
The cyclic representation (Hω, πω, Ωω) constructed in the proof of The-
orem 15.4 is called the Gel’fand–Naimark–Segal (GNS) representa-
tion, or the canonical cyclic representation of A associated with the
state ω on A. The construction is called the GNS construction.
The GNS representation of a ∗-algebra A associated with a state on A
is unique up to unitary equivalences.
Theorem 15.5 (Uniqueness of GNS representation). Let ω
∈EA
and (Hω, πω, Ωω) be the GNS representation of A associated with ω. Sup-
pose that there exists a cyclic representation (H , π, Ω) of A such that
⟨Ω, π(A)Ω⟩= ω(A),
A ∈A.
(15.21)
Then, there exists a unitary transformation U : H →Hω such that
UΩ = Ωω,
(15.22)
Uπ(A)U −1 = πω(A),
A ∈A,
(15.23)
i.e., π is unitarily equivalent to πω with the correspondence Ω →Ωω for
the cyclic vectors.
944
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Proof. Let D := π(A)Ω. Then, a mapping U0 : D →Dω is deﬁned by
U0π(A)Ω := πω(A)Ωω,
A ∈A.
(15.24)
It is easy to see that U0 is linear. We have, for all A, B ∈A,
⟨πω(A)Ωω, πω(B)Ωω⟩= ω(A∗B)
(by (15.17))
= ⟨Ω, π(A∗B)Ω⟩
(by (15.21))
= ⟨π(A)Ω, π(B)Ω⟩.
Hence, ⟨U0π(A)Ω, U0π(B)Ω⟩.
=
⟨π(A)Ω, π(B)Ω⟩. It is obvious that
U0D = Dω. Therefore, by the extension theorem (Theorem 1.3), there exists
a unique unitary transformation U : H →Hω such that U ↾D = U0. Let
Ψ = πω(B)Ωω ∈Dω. Then, U −1Ψ = π(B)Ω. Hence,
Uπ(A)U −1Ψ = πω(AB)Ωω = πω(A)Ψ.
Since UD = Dω, this implies the operator equality (15.23). Equation (15.22)
follows from taking A = I in (15.24).
□
Henceforth, based on Theorem 15.5, we identify any representation
(H , π, Ω) of A as described in Theorem 15.5 with the GNS representation
(Hω, πω, Ωω of A.
With regard to the GNS representation of a C∗-algebra A, it has
boundedness.
Theorem 15.6. Let A be a C∗-algebra and (Hω, πω, Ωω) be the GNS rep-
resentation of A associated with ω ∈EA. Then, for all A ∈A, πω(A) is
bounded with
∥πω(A)∥≤∥A∥.
(15.25)
Proof. Let Ψ = πω(B)Ωω ∈Dω (B ∈A). Then, for all A ∈A, πω(A)Ψ =
πω(AB)Ωω. Hence,
∥πω(A)Ψ∥2 = ⟨Ωω, πω(B∗A∗AB)Ωω⟩= ω(B∗A∗AB)
≤∥A∗A∥ω(B∗B)
( by (15.10))
= ∥A∥2∥Ψ∥2.
Hence, πω(A) is bounded with (15.25).
□
By this theorem and Proposition 15.7, we obtain the following result.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
945
Corollary 15.2. Let A be a C∗-algebra and (Hω, πω, Ωω) be the GNS
representation of A associated with ω ∈EA. For each A ∈A, deﬁne
¯πω : A →B(Hω) by
¯πω(A) := πω(A).
Then, ¯πω is a bounded representation of A with ∥¯πω(A)∥≤∥A∥.
15.1.7
Weyl algebras
In this section, we introduce a speciﬁc class of ∗-algebras which forms a
basis in the mathematical construction of Bose ﬁelds.
Let V be a complex inner product space and V be the Hilbert space
obtained by the completion of V .6 Then, we have the boson Fock space
Fb(V ) over V . For each f ∈V , we deﬁne
WF(f) := eiΦS(f),
(15.26)
where ΦS(f) is the Segal ﬁeld operator on Fb(V ) (see Chapter 5). By
Theorem 5.27, the following hold:
WF(0) = I,
WF(f)∗= WF(−f),
WF(f + g) = eiIm ⟨f,g⟩V /2WF(f)WF(g),
f, g ∈V .
(15.27)
The set {WF(f)|f ∈V } is a subset of the ∗-algebra B(Fb(V )) (the set
of all everywhere deﬁned bounded linear operators on Fb(V )). Hence,
the ∗-algebra generated by {WF(f)|f ∈V } exists. This ∗-algebra has an
abstract form.
Deﬁnition 15.10. The Weyl algebra over V , denoted W(V ), is deﬁned
as the ∗-algebra generated by the elements W(f), f ∈V with relations
W(f)∗= W(−f),
(15.28)
W(f + g) = eiIm ⟨f,g⟩V /2W(f)W(g),
f, g ∈V .
(15.29)
If V
is ﬁnite dimensional, then W(V ) is said to have ﬁnite degrees
of
freedom
and
dim V
is
called
the
degree of
W(V ).
If
V
is
inﬁnite-dimensional, then W(V ) is said to have inﬁnite degrees of
freedom.
Remark 15.6. The notion of the Weyl algebra over V is generalized by
replacing the factor Im ⟨f, g⟩V in (15.29) with a real symplectic form ω(f, g)
(see Remarks 5.32 and 5.44).
6If V is complete, i.e., V is a Hilbert space, then V = V .
946
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We note the following.
Lemma 15.4. Let W(V ) be the Weyl algebra over V .
(i)
W(V ) =
⎧

(15.30)
(ii) W(0) = I.
Proof. (i) Using (15.28) and (15.29), one can show that the set on the right-
hand side of (15.30), which is a subset of W(V ), is a ∗-algebra including
{W(f)|f ∈V }. Hence, (15.30) holds.
(ii) Taking g = 0 in (15.29), we have W(f) = W(f)W(0) for all f ∈V .
Similarly, we have W(f) = W(0)W(f). Hence, by (15.30), AW(0) = I and
W(0)A = I, for all A ∈W(V ). Hence, W(0) = I.
□
A basic property of representations of the Weyl algebra W(V ) is given
in the following lemma.
Lemma 15.5. Let (H , π, D(π)) be a representation of W(V ). Then, for
all f ∈V , π(W(f)), the closure of π(W(f)), is a unitary operator on H .
Proof. For all f ∈V , we have
π(W(f))†π(W(f)) = π(W(f)∗W(f)) = π(W(−f)W(f))
= π(W(0)) = π(I)
= ID(π).
Similarly, we have π(W(f))π(W(f))† = ID(π). Taking the closures of these
equations, we have

π(W(f))
∗
π(W(f)) = I,
π(W(f))

π(W(f))
∗
= I.
Hence, π(W(f)) is a unitary operator.
□
By Lemma 15.5 and Proposition 15.7, we can assume without loss of
generality that, in any representation π of W(V ), π(W(f)) is a unitary
operator for all f ∈V . In what follows, we take this assumption for granted.
The following lemma is used to construct a representation of W(V ).
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
947
Lemma 15.6. Let {U(f)|f ∈V } be a set of unitary operators on a Hilbert
space H satisfying the following:
U(f)∗= U(−f),
(15.31)
U(f + g) = eiIm ⟨f,g⟩V /2U(f)U(g),
f, g ∈V .
(15.32)
Then, there exists a representation π of W(V ) on H such that
π(W(f)) = U(f),
f ∈V .
(15.33)
Proof. We ﬁrst deﬁne a mapping π0 : {W(f)|f ∈V } →{U(f)|f ∈V }
by π0(W(f)) = U(f), f ∈V . It is easy to see that π0(I) = π0(W(0)) =
U(0) = I and, for all f, g ∈V , π0(W(f))∗= π0(W(−f)), π0(W(f +
g)) = eiIm ⟨f,g⟩/2π0(W(f))π0(W(g)). By using Lemma 15.4, we next deﬁne
π : W(V ) →B(H ) by
π(A) :=
n

j=1
cjπ0(W(fj)),
A =
n

j=1
cjW(fj) ∈W(V ).
It is easy to see that π is a representation of W(V ) on H .
□
We introduce a class of representations of the Weyl algebra W(V ).
A representation (H , π) of W(V ) is said to be regular if each unitary
operator π(W(f)) is weakly continuous in f ∈V (i.e., for all Ψ, Φ ∈H ,
the correspondence f →⟨Ψ, π(W(f))Φ⟩is continuous).
It is easy to see that, if (H , π) is a regular representation of W(V ),
then, for any unitary transformation U : H →K (a Hilbert space), the
representation (K , UπU −1) (see (15.11)) is also regular. Hence, the regu-
larity of representations of the Weyl algebra over an inner product space is
a unitary invariant notion.
It follows that the representations of W(V ) are divided into two classes,
i.e., regular ones and non-regular ones. With regard to the regular repre-
sentations of W(V ), we have the following.
Lemma 15.7. Let (H , π) be a regular representation of the Weyl algebra
W(V ). Then, π(W(f)) is strongly continuous in f ∈V .
Proof. We set ˆV (f) := π(W(f)). Let limn→∞∥fn −f∥V = 0 (f, fn ∈V ).
Then, for all Ψ ∈H ,
∥ˆV (fn)Ψ −ˆV (f)Ψ∥2 = 2∥Ψ∥2 −
 ˆV (fn)Ψ, ˆV (f)Ψ

−
 ˆV (f)Ψ, ˆV (fn)Ψ

.
948
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
By the regularity of π, the second and third terms on the right-hand
side converge to −
 ˆV (f)Ψ, ˆV (f)Ψ

=
−∥Ψ∥2 as n
→
∞. Hence,
limn→∞∥ˆV (fn)Ψ −ˆV (f)Ψ∥2 = 0. This means the strong continuity of
ˆV (f) in f.
□
We remark that every regular representation of W(V ) is inequivalent
to all the non-regular representations of W(V ).
Proposition 15.8. Let (H1, π1) be a regular representation of W(V ) and
(H2, π2) be a non-regular representation of W(V ). Then, π1 is inequivalent
to π2.
Proof. We prove the proposition by reduction to absurdity. Suppose
that there existed a unitary transformation U : H1 →H2 such that
Uπ1(W(f))U −1 = π2(W(f)), f
∈V . Let fn, f
∈V
(n ∈N) and
limn→∞∥fn −f∥V = 0. Then, by the weak continuity of π1(W(f)) in f,
we have, for all Ψ, Φ ∈H2,
lim
n→∞

U −1Φ, π1(W(fn))U −1Ψ

=

U −1Φ, π1(W(f))U −1Ψ

.
Hence, limn→∞⟨Φ, π2(W(fn))Ψ⟩= ⟨Φ, π2(W(f))Ψ⟩. Therefore, π2(W(f))
is weakly continuous in f. Thus, π2 is regular. But this contradicts the
present assumption.
□
Remark 15.7. In QFT, in addition to Weyl algebra, another ∗-algebra
plays an important role; it is deﬁned as the ∗-algebra generated by elements
ψ(f), ψ(f)∗, f ∈K (a Hilbert space) with relations
ψ(αf + βg) = αψ(f) + βψ(g),
{ψ(f), ψ(g)∗} = ⟨f, g⟩K ,
{ψ(f), ψ(g)} = 0,
{ψ(f)∗, ψ(g)∗} = 0,
f, g ∈K , α, β ∈C,
where {A, B} := AB + BA (anti-commutator). This ∗-algebra is called
the CAR algebra over K and is used to construct Fermi ﬁelds. Sections
6.14 and 6.16 in this book can be rewritten from the point of view of the
representations of CAR algebra.

15.1.8
Schr¨odinger representation of Weyl algebra with
ﬁnite degrees of freedom and uniqueness theorem
In this section, we consider the representations of a Weyl algebra with
ﬁnite degrees of freedom and show that, under a suitable condition, they
are unique up to unitary equivalences.
We ﬁrst review the basic facts in quantum mechanics in the Schr¨odinger
representation of the CCR with N degrees of freedom (N ∈N) (see Remark
5.36). Let qn and pn (n = 1, . . . , N) be the self-adjoint operators on L2(RN),
as described in Remark 5.36. Then, for all t ∈R, eitqn and eitpn are unitary
operators satisfying the following: for all s, t ∈R and n, m = 1, . . . , N,
eisqneitpm = e−istδnmeitpmeisqn,
(15.34)
eisqneitqm = eitqmeisqn,
eispneitpm = eitpmeispn.
(15.35)
The following fact is well known.
Theorem 15.7. The set {eitqn, eitpn|t ∈R, n = 1, . . . , N} is irreducible.
Proof. See, for example, Arai (2006b), Corollary 3.14.
□
It follows from (15.34) and (15.35) that, for all t = (t1, . . . , tN) ∈RN,
the operators
US(t) := eit1q1eit2q2 · · · eitN qN ,
VS(t) := eit1p1eit2p2 · · · eitN pN
are unitary and, for all s, t ∈RN,
US(s)VS(t) = e−is·tVS(t)US(s),
US(s)US(t) = US(t)US(s),
VS(s)VS(t) = VS(t)VS(s),
where s · t := N
j=1sjtj.
Each element z = (z1, . . . , zN) in CN is uniquely written as z = s + it,
where sj := Re zj, tj := Im zj, j = 1, . . . , N. Using this decomposition of z,
we deﬁne a unitary operator WS(z) on L2(RN) by
WS(z) := eis·t/2US(s)VS(t).
Then, it follows that, for all z, w ∈CN,
WS(0) = I, WS(z)∗= WS(−z),
WS(z + w) = eiIm (z∗·w)/2WS(z)WS(w).
950
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence, the ∗-algebra generated by {WS(z)|z ∈CN} has the same algebraic
structure as that of the Weyl algebra A(CN) over CN. Therefore, there
exists a representation πS of A(CN) on L2(RN) such that
πS(W(z)) = WS(z),
z ∈CN.
We call the representation (L2(RN), πS) the Schr¨odinger representation of
W(CN). It follows from Theorem 15.7 that πS is irreducible.
With regard to representations of the Weyl algebra W(CN), the follow-
ing uniqueness theorem holds.
Theorem 15.8. Let (H , π) be a regular and irreducible representation of
W(CN) such that H is separable. Then, there exists a unitary transforma-
tion U : H →L2(RN)such that
Uπ(A)U −1 = πS(A),
A ∈W(CN).
(15.36)
Proof. By the regularity of π and Lemma 15.7, the correspondence RN ∋
s →π(W(s)) is an N-parameter strongly continuous unitary group. Hence,
according to the extended Stone theorem (Theorem 1.46), there exists an
N-tuple (Q1, . . . , QN) of strongly commuting self-adjoint operators on H
such that
π(W(s)) = eis1Q1 · · · eisN QN ,
s ∈RN.
Similarly, there exists an N-tuple (P1, . . . , PN) of strongly commuting self-
adjoint operators on H such that
π(W(it)) = eit1P1 · · · eitN PN ,
s ∈RN.
The set {eitQn, eitPn|n = 1, . . . , N, t ∈R} is irreducible by the irreducibility
of π. Moreover, it is easy to see that (H , {Qn, Pn|n = 1, . . . , N}) is a
Weyl representation of the CCR with N degrees of freedom (see Remark
5.35). Hence, according to von Neumann’s uniqueness theorem (see Remark
5.36), there exists a unitary transformation U : H →L2(RN) such that
UeitQnU −1 = eitqn,
UeitPnU −1 = eitpn, n = 1, . . . , N, t ∈R. It follows
from these equations that Uπ(W(z))U −1 = WS(z), z ∈CN. This and
Lemma 15.4 imply (15.36).
□
More generally, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 15.9 (Uniqueness theorem). Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional
inner product space and (H1, π1) and (H2, π2) be the regular and irre-
ducible representations of the Weyl algebra W(V ) such that H1 and H2
are separable. Then, π1 is unitarily equivalent to π2.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
951
Proof. Let dim V
= d and (e1, . . . , ed) be a CONS of V . Then, each
f ∈V
is written as f = d
j=1 zjej with zj = ⟨ej, f⟩V
∈C. The
correspondence f →z = (z1, . . . , zd) ∈Cd is one to one. For each
z ∈Rd, we deﬁne ˆπi(W(z)) := πi(W(d
j=1 zjej)) (i = 1, 2) and extend
it by linearity (see Lemma 15.4). Then, it is easy to see that (Hi, ˆπi) is
a regular and irreducible representation of W(Cd). Hence, by Theorem
15.8, there exists a unitary transformation Ui : Hi →L2(Rd) such that
Uiˆπi(A)U −1
i
= πS(A), A ∈W(Cd). Letting U := U −1
2 U1, we see that U is
a unitary transformation from H1 to H2, and it holds that U ˆπ1(A)U −1 =
ˆπ2(A), A ∈W(Cd). This implies that Uπ1(W(f))U −1 = π2(W(f)), f ∈V .
Thus, the desired result follows.
□
15.1.9
Fock representation
Let V be an inner product space as before. It follows from the description at
the beginning of Section 15.1.7 that there is a representation (Fb(V ), πFock)
of W(V ) such that
πFock(W(f)) = WF(f) = eiΦS(f),
f ∈V .
(15.37)
This representation is called the Fock representation of W(V ).
The Fock representation πFock is, in fact, the GNS representation asso-
ciated with a state on W(V ), as shown in the following. We set H := V .
A linear functional ωF on W(V ) is deﬁned by
ωF(W(f)) := e−∥f∥2
V /4,
f ∈V
(15.38)
and its linear extension to W(V ). By (5.197), we have
e−∥f∥2
V /4 =

ΩH , eiΦS(f)ΩH

= ⟨ΩH , πFock(W(f))ΩH ⟩.
Hence,
ωF(A) = ⟨ΩH , πFock(A)ΩH ⟩,
A ∈W(V ).
This
implies
that
ωF
is
a
state
on
W(V ).
By
Theorem
5.27,
πFock(W(V ))ΩH
is dense in Fb(H ). Hence, the Fock representation
(Fb(H ), πFock, ΩH ) is the GNS representation of W(V ) associated
with ωF.
Proposition 15.9. The Fock representation (Fb(H ), πFock) of W(V ) is
regular.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.27(iii).
□
952
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let H and K be Hilbert spaces, and D be a dense subspace of H .
Then, we have the Weyl algebra W(D) over D. For a unitary operator
U : H →K , UD is dense in K . Hence, we have the Weyl algebra W(UD)
over UD. Let π(D)
Fock and π(UD)
Fock
be the Fock representations of W(D) and
W(UD), respectively. There is a natural relation between π(D)
Fock and π(UD)
Fock :
Theorem 15.10. For all f ∈D,
Γb(U)π(D)
Fock (W(f))Γb(U)−1 = π(UD)
Fock
(W(Uf)),
(15.39)
where Γb(·) is the boson Γ-operator (see Section 5.4).
Proof. By (5.173) and the unitary covariance of functional calculus, we
have
Γb(U)eiΦS,H (f)Γb(U)−1 = eiΦS,K (Uf),
f ∈D.
Hence, (15.39) holds.
□
15.2
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
15.2.1
Algebraic symmetry
We now proceed to the consideration of symmetry in quantum physics.
In an algebraic approach to quantum physics, it is assumed that, to each
quantum system Σ, there corresponds a ∗-algebra AΣ called the algebra
of observables. The algebra AΣ itself is not “physical,” but the set of all
representations of AΣ carries the physics of the quantum system Σ. In other
words, quantum phenomena that may occur in the quantum system Σ are
described on the level of representations of AΣ. The variety of quantum
phenomena that the quantum system Σ may have is understood as the
variety of representations of AΣ. In this scheme, the expectation value of
observations of the observable A ∈AΣ in the state ω on AΣ is given by
ω(A). From the point of view which takes the algebra of observables as one
of the fundamental objects in a quantum system, a symmetry in a quantum
system is deﬁned for the algebra of observables.
In what follows, A denotes a ∗-algebra (physically, it represents the
algebra of observables in a quantum system).
Deﬁnition 15.11.
(i) A mapping α : A →A is called an algebraic symmetry of A if it is
a ∗-automorphism on A, i.e., α ∈∗-Aut(A).
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
953
(ii) Two algebraic symmetries α and β of A are said to commute
if αβ = βα.
In addition to a single algebraic symmetry, a family of algebraic symme-
tries which has a group structure is important. Let G be a group. A mapping
ϱ : G →∗-Aut(A) is called a ∗-representation (or simply representation)
of G on A if
ϱ(g1g2) = ϱ(g1)ϱ(g2),
g1, g2 ∈G.
As is easily seen, the range of ϱ, i.e., {ϱ(g)}g∈G is a subgroup of ∗-Aut(A).
The family {ϱ(g)}g∈G is called a group of algebraic symmetries of A
indexed by G.
In particular, If G = Rd (the d-dimensional translation group), then
{ϱ(a)}a∈Rd is called a d-parameter group of algebraic symmetries of A. We
write ϱ(a) = ϱa.
If G is a continuous group, the ∗-algebra A is a topological space and
the mapping g →ϱ(g) is continuous, then the symmetry described by
{ϱ(g)}g∈G is called a continuous symmetry.
In applications to QFT, algebraic symmetries are divided mainly into
two classes: one is about external symmetries, which is concerned with
space-time symmetries (e.g., translations or rotations in space-time), and
the other is about internal symmetries, which may be independent of space-
time (e.g., rotations in spin space or iso-spin space). In axiomatic QFT, it
is usually assumed that external symmetries commute with internal ones.
Let ω be a state on A, i.e., ω ∈EA and α be an algebraic symmetry
of A. Then, the composite mapping ω ◦α : A →C is deﬁned:
(ω ◦α)(A) := ω(α(A)),
A ∈A.
(15.40)
Proposition 15.10. The composite mapping ω ◦α is a state on A.
Proof. The linearity of ω ◦α is easy to prove. For all A ∈A, α(A∗A) =
α(A)∗α(A). Hence, ω(α(A∗A)) ≥0. Therefore, ω ◦α satisﬁes the positivity
condition. By Proposition 15.2, α(I) = I. Hence, (ω◦α)(I) = 1. Thus, ω◦α
is a state on A.
□
Based on Proposition 15.10, we deﬁne the following notion.
Deﬁnition 15.12. A state ω on A is said to be α-invariant if ω ◦α = ω.
Example 15.5. Let H be a Hilbert space and H be a self-adjoint operator
on H having an eigenvalue E0 ∈R. Let Ψ0 ∈ker(H −E0) with ∥Ψ0∥= 1
954
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
and ωΨ0 be the vector state on the ∗-algebra B(H ) associated Ψ0:
ωΨ0(A) := ⟨Ψ0, AΨ0⟩,
A ∈B(H ).
For each t ∈R, we deﬁne αt : B(H ) →B(H ) by
αt(A) := eitHAe−itH, A ∈B(H ).
It is easy to see that αt is an algebraic symmetry on B(H ). Noting that
e−itHΨ0 = e−itE0Ψ0 by Theorem 1.26(i), one can show that ωΨ0 is αt-
invariant.
By Proposition 15.10, for each algebraic symmetry α of A, a mapping
α∗on the state space EA is deﬁned by
α∗(ω) := ω ◦α,
ω ∈EA.
(15.41)
The mapping α∗is called the dual mapping, or the dual, of α. The state
α∗(ω) is called the dual transform of ω by α∗.
It follows that ω is α-invariant if and only if α∗(ω) = ω.
It is easy to see that α∗is an aﬃne mapping, i.e., for all ω1, ω2 ∈EA
and λ ∈(0, 1),
α∗(λω1 + (1 −λ)ω2) = λα∗(ω1) + (1 −λ)α∗(ω2).
Proposition 15.11. For all algebraic symmetries α of A, the dual mapping
α∗is bijective with
(α∗)−1 = (α−1)∗.
(15.42)
Proof. (injectivity) Suppose that, for ω1, ω2 ∈EA, α∗(ω1) = α∗(ω2). Then,
for all A ∈A, ω1(α(A)) = ω2(α(A). Since α is surjective, it follows that,
for all B ∈A, ω1(B) = ω2(B). Hence, ω1 = ω2. Therefore, α∗is injective.
(surjectivity) Let ω ∈EA and set η := ω ◦α−1. Then, η ∈EA and
α∗(η) = ω, Hence, α∗is surjective and (α∗)−1(ω) = η. By the deﬁnition
of η, we have η = (α−1)∗(ω) Hence, (α∗)−1(ω) = (α−1)∗(ω). Since ω is an
arbitrary element in EA, (15.42) follows.
□
Proposition 15.11 means that α∗is a symmetry of EA in the ordinary
sense.7 Based on this fact, the following deﬁnition is possible.
Deﬁnition 15.13. If a subset M of EA satisﬁes α∗(M) = M, then M is
said to be α∗-symmetric.
7For a non-empty set M, a bijection on M is called a symmetry of M.

15.2.2
Deﬁnition of spontaneous symmetry breaking
We consider a quantum system of which algebra of observables is given by
a ∗-algebra A. As we have seen in Section 15.1.6, for each state ω ∈EA, the
GNS representation
Rω := (Hω, πω, Ωω)
(15.43)
of A is associated. As remarked at the beginning of the preceding section,
the family {Rω|ω ∈EA} of representations of A is interpreted as carrying
the physics of the quantum system under consideration. From this point of
view, each representation Rω is called a phase of the quantum system.
Let α be an algebraic symmetry of A and write
α∗ω := α∗(ω),
ω ∈EA.
By (15.40) and (15.41),
α∗ω(A) = ω(α(A)),
A ∈A.
(15.44)
Since α is surjective, it follows that the set of all expectation values of the
state ω coincides with that of the state α∗ω:
{ω(A)|A ∈A} = {α∗ω(A)|A ∈A}.
There exists a natural relation between the two phases Rω and Rα∗ω.
Theorem 15.11. Let ω ∈EA. Then, there exists a unitary transformation
U : Hα∗ω →Hω such that
UΩα∗ω = Ωω,
Uπα∗ω(A)U −1 = πω(α(A)),
A ∈A.
(15.45)
Proof. Let π(A) := πω(α(A)), A ∈A. Then, by Lemma 15.3 and the GNS
construction, (Hω, π, Ωω) is a cyclic representation of A. Moreover, we have
⟨Ωω, π(A)Ωω⟩= ⟨Ωω, πω(α(A))Ωω⟩= α∗ω(A) (by (15.44)).
Hence, by Theorem 15.5, there exists a unitary transformation V : Hω →
Hα∗ω such that V Ωω = Ωα∗ω and V π(A)V −1 = πα∗ω(A). Then, U := V −1
is the desired unitary transformation.
□
Theorem 15.11 shows that the phase Rα∗ω is equivalent to the repre-
sentation (Hω, πω ◦α, Dω). Hence, the relation between the phase Rα∗ω
and the phase Rω can be considered as that between πω and πω ◦α in the
same Hilbert space Hω. Based on this fact, we deﬁne the symmetry with
respect to α in the phase Rω as follows.
956
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Deﬁnition 15.14.
(i) If there exists a unitary transformation V : Hω →Hω such that
πω(α(A)) = V πω(A)V −1, A ∈A,
(15.46)
i.e., πω ◦α is unitarily equivalent to πω, then we say that the quantum
system under consideration is α-symmetric in the phase Rω, or that
the α-symmetry (or the symmetry α) is not broken in the phase Rω.
(ii) If the quantum system under consideration is not α-symmetric, i.e.,
there exists no unitary transformation V as in (i), then we say that
the symmetry α is spontaneously broken (or simply broken) in the
phase Rω.
Remark 15.8. Since D(πω(A)) = Dω = D(πω(α(A)) for all A ∈A, (15.46)
implies that V Dω = Dω.
As is obvious from the deﬁnition above, spontaneous symmetry break-
ing (or simply symmetry breaking) is not a concept concerning the algebra
of observables itself, but it is a concept on the level of representations of
the algebra of observables (physically, on the phenomenal level). Even in
the case where spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, the original sym-
metry, i.e., the algebraic symmetry itself remains ﬁxed. This distinction is
important to understand clearly spontaneous symmetry breaking.
From the representation theoretical point of view, the spontaneous
breaking of symmetry α in the phase Rω is equivalent to that πω is inequiv-
alent to πω ◦α. Hence, an inequivalent representation of the algebra of
observable is associated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking.8
In QFT and quantum statistical mechanics, spontaneous symmetry
breaking of internal symmetries mainly plays an important role. The states
to be considered are basically vacua (ground states) in QFT and ther-
mal equilibrium states (Kubo–Martin–Schwinger (KMS) states) in quan-
tum statistical mechanics.
We also note the following fact.
Proposition 15.12. Let α be an algebraic symmetry of A and ω ∈EA.
Then, the quantum system under consideration is α-symmetric in the phase
8Generally, inequivalent representations of ∗-algebras, CCR, or CAR play important
roles in quantum physics in the sense that they may be associated with “characteristic”
quantum phenomena (e.g., Bose–Einstein condensation, superconductivity and superﬂu-
idity). See, for example, Arai (2020).

Rω if and only if there exists a unitary transformation W : Hω →Hα∗ω
such that
Wπω(A)W −1 = πα∗ω(A),
A ∈A.
(15.47)
Proof. Suppose that the quantum system is α-symmetric in the phase Rω.
Let U be the unitary transformation in Theorem 15.11 and V be that in
Deﬁnition 15.14. Then, W := U −1V is a unitary transformation from Hω
to Hα∗ω satisfying (15.47).
Conversely, suppose that there exists a unitary transformation W :
Hω →Hα∗ω such that (15.47) holds. Then, V
:= UW is a unitary
transformation on Hω and (15.46) holds. Hence, the quantum system is
α-symmetric in the phase Rω.
□
15.2.3
Absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in
quantum systems with ﬁnite degrees of freedom
The following theorem suggests that one cannot expect the existence of
symmetry breaking in “most” quantum systems with ﬁnite degrees of
freedom.
Theorem 15.12. Let V be a d-dimensional inner product space (d ∈N)
and (Hω, πω, Ωω) be the GNS representation of the Weyl algebra W(V )
over V such that Hω is separable, πω is irreducible and regular. Let α
be an algebraic symmetry of W(V ) such that πω ◦α is regular. Then, the
symmetry α is not broken in the phase (Hω, πω, Ωω).
Proof. Under the present assumption, πω(W(V ))′ = CI. Hence, by Theo-
rem 15.3, πω◦α is an irreducible representation of W(V ). Under the present
assumption, this representation is regular. Hence, by Theorem 15.9, there
exists a unitary transformation U : Hω →Hω such that Uπω(A)U −1 =
πω(α(A)), A ∈W(V ).
□
In the case of quantum systems with inﬁnite degrees of freedom, how-
ever, there may exist spontaneous symmetry breaking. We next discuss a
simple example in which spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs.
15.3
Example: A Free Bose Field
In this section, we consider a free Bose ﬁeld from the point of view of
spontaneous symmetry breaking. The symmetry to be considered here is
a symmetry concerning a global translation of the Bose ﬁeld. We shall see
958
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
the following: (i) if the space S on which the Bose ﬁeld exists is of a ﬁnite
volume in such a way that S is a d-dimensional cubic box (d ∈N), then no
spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs; (ii) if S is an inﬁnite volume space
with S = Rd, then spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. This diﬀerence
is very interesting to note. In what follows, we describe details of these
facts.
15.3.1
A ﬁnite volume theory
We consider the quantum system of a free Bose ﬁeld on the d-dimensional
cubic box VL deﬁned by (9.87). We use the notation in Section 9.9 with
the physical unit system where ℏ= 1 and c = 1. For convenience, we
work with momentum representation. Hence, the Hilbert space in which
the Bose ﬁeld acts is taken to be the boson Fock space Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) over
ℓ2(ΓL) (see (9.88)). We assume that the one-boson energy is given by a
function (sequence) ϵ on ΓL such that ϵ(k) > 0 for k ∈ΓL \ {0} and
ϵ(0) = 0
(15.48)
Example 15.6. (i) ϵ(k) =
k2
2m = ENR(k) (a non-relativistic boson with
mass m > 0) (see (9.35)).
(ii) ϵ(k) = |k| (a relativistic boson with mass 0).
We denote the multiplication operator by the function ϵ on ℓ2(ΓL) by
the same symbol ϵ. The Hamiltonian of the free Bose ﬁeld is deﬁned by the
second quantization of ϵ:
HL := dΓ(L)
b (ϵ).
(15.49)
It follows that HL is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
We denote the Fock vacuum in Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) by ψ0. Then, we have
HLψ0 = 0.
(15.50)
Let aL(k) be the boson annihilation operator with momentum k deﬁned
in Section 9.9.1 and set
a0 := aL(0).
(15.51)
It follows that, for all k ∈ΓL \ {0},
[a0, aL(k)#] = 0,
[a∗
0, aL(k)#] = 0
on Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
(15.52)
By (5.54), we have
aL(k)ψ0 = 0,
k ∈ΓL.
(15.53)
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
959
By Proposition 9.12 and (15.48), we have for all Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(D(ϵ))
(see (5.2))
HLΨ =

k∈ΓL\{0}
ϵ(k)aL(k)∗aL(k)Ψ
(15.54)
in the sense of strong convergence. Note that the zero-mode a0 does not
appear on the right-hand side.
For each n ∈N, we deﬁne
ψn :=
1
√
n!
(a∗
0)nψ0.
(15.55)
Then, it is easy to see that ψn ∈D(HL) and {ψn}∞
n=0 forms an ONS.9 By
(15.52) and (15.54), we have
[HL, a0] = 0
on Fb,ﬁn(ℓ2(ΓL)).
By this fact and (15.53), we obtain
HLψn = 0.
(15.56)
This means that each ψn is a ground state of HL with the ground state
energy being equal to zero. Hence, the ground state of HL is inﬁnitely
degenerate.
We denote by ΦL(·) the Segal ﬁeld operator on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)). As we have
seen in Section 9.9, we have
ΦL(u) =
1
√
2

k∈ΓL
(aL(k)∗u(k) + aL(k)u(k)∗)
(15.57)
on Fb,0(ℓ2(ΓL)).
Using the discrete Fourier transform ˆ1 ∈ℓ2(ΓL) of the constant function
1 on VL, we deﬁne a self-adjoint operator by
GL := ΦL(iˆ1).
(15.58)
It is easy to see that
ˆ1k = Ld/2δk,0,
k ∈ΓL.
(15.59)
9Note that ψn is of the same form as the (n + 1)th eigenstate of the Hamiltonian of a
one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (see, for example, Arai, 2014b, (7.16) or
Arai and Ezawa, 1999b, (3.187)).
960
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Hence,
GL = iLd/2
√
2 (a∗
0 −a0)
(15.60)
Formulae (15.59) and (15.48) imply
eitϵˆ1 = ˆ1,
t ∈R.
(15.61)
Therefore, using (5.179), we obtain that, for all t ∈R and θ ∈R,
eitHLeiθGLe−itHL = eiθGL, i.e.,
eitHLeiθGL = eiθGLeitHL,
θ, t ∈R.
(15.62)
This means that HL and GL strongly commute. Hence, in particular, the
following operator equalities hold:
eitHLGLe−itHL = GL,
eiθGLHLe−iθGL = HL,
θ, t ∈R
(15.63)
The ﬁrst equation in (15.63) means that GL is a conserved quantity, while
the second one yields the following proposition.
Proposition 15.13. For any ground state Ω of HL and all θ ∈R, e−iθGLΩ
is a ground sate of HL. Moreover,
e−iθGL ker HL = ker HL.
(15.64)
Proof. We have HLΩ = 0. Hence, eiθGLHLe−iθGLΩ = 0. Multiplying
e−iθGL from the left-hand side of this equation, we obtain HLe−iθGLΩ = 0.
Hence, e−iθGLΩ is a ground state of HL. The fact just proved implies
that e−iθGL ker HL ⊂ker HL. Hence, ker HL ⊂eiθGL ker HL. Since θ ∈R
is arbitrary, one can replace θ by −θ to obtain ker HL ⊂e−iθGL ker HL.
Hence, (15.64) holds.
□
The set {e−iθGL}θ∈R of unitary operators is a strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group. Equation (15.64) shows that each unitary opera-
tor e−iθGL is a symmetry of the ground state space ker HL.
One can ﬁnd explicitly the ground state space ker HL.
Theorem 15.13. Let Hn := {αψn|α ∈C}, n ∈Z+. Then,
ker HL = ⊕∞
n=0Hn.
(15.65)
Proof. It is easy to see that
ker ϵ = {αf0|α ∈C},
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
961
where f0 ∈ℓ2(ΓL) is deﬁned by f0(0) := 1 and f0(k) := 0, k ̸= 0. We
decompose ℓ2(ΓL) as
ℓ2(ΓL) = ker ϵ ⊕(ker ϵ)⊥.
Then, we have ϵ = 0 ⊕ϵ+ with ϵ+(k) := ϵ(k), k ̸= 0. It is obvious that the
Hilbert spaces ker ϵ and (ker ϵ)⊥are separable. Hence, by Theorem 5.40,
there exists a unitary operator U : Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) →Fb(ker ϵ) ⊗Fb((ker ϵ)⊥)
such that Uψ0 = φ0 ⊗η0, where φ0 (resp., η0) is the Fock vacuum in
Fb(ker ϵ) (resp., Fb((ker ϵ)⊥)), and
UHLU −1 = I ⊗dΓb(ϵ+),
Ua0U −1 = b(δ0) ⊗I,
where b(·) is the annihilation operator on Fb(ker ϵ) and δ0(k) := δ0,k,
k ∈ΓL. We have ker ϵ+ = {0}. Hence, by (7.44), we see that ker dΓb(ϵ+) =
{αη0|α ∈C}. Hence,
ker HL := {U −1ψ ⊗η0|ψ ∈Fb(ker ϵ)}.
Since ker ϵ is one-dimensional, it follows that
Fb(ker ϵ) = {{αn(b(δ0)∗)nφ0}∞
n=0|n ∈Z+, αn ∈C}.
Note that U −1(b(δ0)∗)nφ0 ⊗η0 = (a∗
0)nψ0. Hence, (15.65) holds.
□
We take the Weyl algebra
WL := W(L2(VL))
(15.66)
as the algebra of observables of the quantum system under consideration.
We denote by ˆπL(·) the Fock representation of the Weyl algebra
W(ℓ2(ΓL)) over ℓ2(ΓL) on Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) (see Section 15.1.9):
ˆπL(W(u)) := eiΦL(u),
u ∈ℓ2(ΓL).
(15.67)
Then, one can deﬁne a representation of πL of WL by
πL(W(f)) := ˆπL(W( ˆf)),
f ∈L2(VL),
(15.68)
where ˆf is the discrete Fourier transform of f ∈L2(VL). It follows that the
representation (Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), πL) is a regular and irreducible representation
of WL.
962
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let πFock(·) be the Fock representation of WL on Fb(L2(VL)). Then, by
Theorem 15.10, we have
Γb(F (L)
d
)πFock(W(f))Γb(F (L)
d
)−1 = πL(W(f)),
f ∈L2(VL),
where F (L)
d
: L2(VL) →ℓ2(ΓL) is the discrete Fourier transform (see Sec-
tion 9.9.1). Therefore, πL is unitarily equivalent to πFock.
Among the algebraic symmetries of the Weyl algebra WL, we consider
one of the simplest ones. For each f ∈L2(VL), we have

VL
|f(x)|dx ≤1
2

VL
(1 + |f(x)|2)dx ≤1
2

Ld +

VL
|f(x)|2dx

< ∞.
Hence, the complex number
⟨f⟩L :=

VL
f(x)dx
(15.69)
is deﬁned. For each ε ∈R, a ∗-automorphism αε,L on WL is deﬁned by
αε,L(W(f)) := eiε Re ⟨f⟩LW(f),
f ∈L2(VL),
(15.70)
where Re ⟨f⟩L denotes the real part of ⟨f⟩L. It follows that
αε,Lαθ,L = αε+θ,L,
α, θ ∈R.
Hence, {αε,L}ε∈R is a one-parameter group of algebraic symmetries of WL.
Since the mapping αε,L is independent of spacial operations, it may belong
to internal symmetries.
It follows from (15.70) that
πL(αε,L(W(f))) = ei(ΦL( ˆf)+ε Re ⟨f⟩L).
This means that, on the level of the representation πL, the ∗-automorphism
αε,L acts as the shift of ΦL( ˆf) by εRe ⟨f⟩L. This shift is more explicitly
represented in terms of the distribution kernel of a quantum ﬁeld, as shown
in the following.
Let DL := VL \ ∂VL (∂VL denotes the boundary of VL) and C∞
0 (DL) be
the set of C∞-functions f on DL such that supp f ⊂DL. Then, it is easy
to see that the mapping ϕL : C∞
0 (DL) →L(Fb(L2(VL))) deﬁned by
ϕL(f) := ΦL( 
Re f) + iΦL( 
Im f),
f ∈C∞
0 (DL)
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
963
is an operator-valued distribution with common domain Fb,0(L2(VL)).
Using (15.57), one can show that the distribution kernel of ϕL is of the
form
ϕL(x) =
1
√
2

k∈ΓL
(aL(k)∗φk(x) + aL(k)φ∗
k(x)),
where φk (k ∈ΓL) is the function deﬁned by (9.89). It follows that, in terms
of the distribution kernel ϕL(x), the shift mentioned above is rephrased as
ϕL(x) →ϕL(x) + ε,
i.e., a global translation of the quantum ﬁeld ϕL(x) by a constant ε.
We have by Corollary 5.12,
eiεGLeiΦL( ˆ
f)e−iεGL = ei(ΦL( ˆ
f)+εRe ⟨f⟩L),
f ∈L2(VL).
(15.71)
Hence,
πL(αε,L(W(f))) = eiεGLπL(W(f))e−iεGL.
Therefore, for all A ∈WL,
πL(αε,L(A)) = eiεGLπL(A)e−iεGL.
(15.72)
This means that πL ◦αε,L is unitarily equivalent to πL. Hence, we obtain
the following fact.
Proposition 15.14. For any phase of the form (Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), πL, Ω) in the
quantum system under consideration, the αε,L-symmetry is not broken.
For (n, θ) ∈Z+ × R, we deﬁne a unit vector Ψn,θ ∈Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) by
Ψn,θ := e−iθGLψn.
(15.73)
By Proposition 15.13, Ψn,θ is a ground state of HL. Let
ω(L)
n,θ(W(f)) := ⟨Ψn,θ, πL(W(f))Ψn,θ⟩.
(15.74)
Then, it is obvious that ω(L)
n,θ is a state on WL.
Lemma 15.8. For each (n, θ) ∈Z+×R, span {πL(W(f))Ψn,θ|f ∈L2(VL)}
is dense in Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
Proof. By Theorem 5.27, M := span {eiΦL(u)ψn|u ∈ℓ2(ΓL)} is dense in
Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)). Since e−iθGL is unitary, e−iθGLM is dense in Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)). By
the Weyl relations, we have for all u ∈ℓ2(ΓL)
e−iθGLeiΦL(u)ψn = ei⟨iˆ1,u⟩eiΦL(u)Ψn,θ.
Hence, span {eiΦL(u)Ψn,θ|u ∈ℓ2(ΓL)} is dense.

For each n ∈Z+, a subset of the state space EWL is deﬁned by
En := {ω(L)
n,θ|θ ∈R}.
(15.75)
Proposition 15.15. For all n ∈Z+ and ε ∈R, α∗
ε,L is a bijection on En
(i.e., α∗
ε,L is a symmetry of En) with
α∗
ε,Lω(L)
n,θ = ω(L)
n,θ+ε.
(15.76)
Proof. Let A ∈WL. Then,
ω(L)

=

Ψn,θ, eiεGLπL(A)e−iεGLΨn,θ

(by (15.72))
= ⟨Ψn,θ+ε, πL(A)Ψn,θ+ε⟩= ω(L)
n,θ+ε(A).
Hence, (15.76) holds. This shows that α∗
ε,L maps En into En. For any ω(L)
n,θ ∈
En, we have α∗
ε,Lω(L)
n,θ−ε = ω(L)
n,θ. Hence, α∗
ε,L is surjective (the injectivity of
α∗
ε,L is due to Proposition 15.11).
□
By Lemma 15.8,
Rn,θ := (Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)), πL, Ψn,θ)
(15.77)
is a cyclic representation of WL. Hence, it is the GNS representation of WL
associated with ω(L)
n,θ. Therefore, Proposition 15.14 yields the following fact.
Proposition 15.16. For any ε ∈R, αε,L-symmetry is not broken in each
phase Rn,θ.
Thus, in the model under consideration, the ground state is degenerate,
but the algebraic symmetry αε,L is not broken.
We next consider the time development of the representative πL(W(f))
(f ∈L2(VL)) by the Hamiltonian HL. Recall that
eitHL = Γb(eitϵ),
t ∈R.
Hence, by Theorem 15.10, we have
eitHLπL(W(f))e−itHL = eiΦL(eitϵ ˆf).
The one-particle Hamiltonian in L2(VL) is given by
hϵ := (F (L)
d
)−1ϵF (L)
d
,
(15.78)
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
965
which is a non-negative self-adjoint operator on L2(VL). Since eitϵ ˆf =
F (L)
d
(eithϵf), we have
πL(W(eithϵf)) = eitHLπL(W(f))e−itHL.
A mapping γt,L : WL →WL is deﬁned by
γt,L(W(f)) := W(eithϵf),
f ∈L2(VL).
It is easy to see that {γt,L}t∈R is a one-parameter group of algebraic sym-
metries of WL. Thus,
πL(γt,LW(f)) = eitHLπL(W(f))e−itHL.
The algebraic symmetry γt,L is about time symmetry and hence an
external symmetry. Therefore one may infer that it commutes with αε,L.
Indeed, this is the case.
Proposition 15.17. For all ε, t ∈R,
αε,Lγt,L = γt,Lαε,L.
(15.79)
Proof. Let f ∈L2(VL). Then, (αε,Lγt,L)(W(f)) = eiεRe ⟨f⟩LW(eithϵf) and
(γt,Lαε,L(W(f)) = eiεRe ⟨eithϵ f⟩LW(eithϵf). Using the unitarity of the dis-
crete Fourier transform F (L)
d
, we have ⟨eithϵf⟩L = ⟨1, eithϵf⟩= ⟨ˆ1, eitϵ ˆf⟩.
By (15.59) and (15.48), we have ⟨ˆ1, eitϵ ˆf⟩= Ld/2 ˆf(0) = ⟨1, ˆf⟩= ⟨f⟩L.
Hence, ⟨eithϵf⟩L = ⟨f⟩L. Thus, (15.79) follows.
□
Remark 15.9. In the proof above, the zero-energy condition (15.48) plays
a key role. In fact, one can show that (15.79) holds for all ε, t ∈R if and
only if (15.48) holds.

Inﬁnite volume limit
We now consider the inﬁnite volume limit L →∞of the ﬁnite volume

0 + a(v)∗
with v := u −u(0)δ0 (note that v(0) = 0). Hence, we need only to prove
(15.80) for vectors of the form Ψ = a(v1)∗· · · a(vq)∗(a∗
0)pψ0 (p, q ≥0),
where vj ∈ℓ2(ΓL) satisﬁes vj(0) = 0. Moreover, eiθGLa(vj)e−iθGL = a(vj),
a(vj)a∗
0 = a∗
0a(vj) (on FF(ℓ2(ΓL))) and a(vj)ψ0 = 0. Hence, a(vj)Ψn,θ = 0.
Hence, in the case where q ≥1, (15.80) holds without taking the limit
L →∞. Therefore, for vectors of the form Ψ = (a∗
0)pψ0, we need only to
prove (15.80).
Using Theorem 5.36, we have

Since θ ̸= 0, it follows that limL→∞⟨(a∗

Ψ ∈Fb,ﬁn(ℓ2(ΓL)), (15.80) holds.
We already know that the subspace Fb,ﬁn(ℓ2(ΓL)) is dense in
Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)). Since ∥Ψn,θ∥= 1, {Ψn,θ}n is bounded. Hence, by Proposi-
tion A.1 in Appendix A, (15.80) holds for all Ψ ∈Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)).
□
As we have seen in Section 9.9.2, Fb(ℓ2(ΓL)) can be identiﬁed with
a closed subspace of Fb(L2(Rd)). Then, Proposition 15.18 implies that
the weak limit w- limL→∞Ψn,θ = 0 in Fb(L2(Rd)) (Problem 1). This
suggests that, in the framework of inﬁnite volume theory constructed in
Section 9.9.3, no ground states as the inﬁnite volume limit of Ψn,θ exist.
A standard method to construct a QFT in an inﬁnite volume system
from a QFT in a ﬁnite volume system is to use the GNS representation
associated with the state deﬁned as the inﬁnite volume limit of a state in
the ﬁnite volume system. For this reason, we calculate the inﬁnite volume
limit of the state ω(L)
n,θ.
We denote by L2
0(Rd) the set of elements f in L2(Rd) such that supp f
is bounded. Each f ∈L2
0(Rd) can be regarded as a function in L2(VL) if

15.3.3
States of the inﬁnite volume system
Since VL →Rd as L →∞, the position space of one boson in the inﬁ-
nite volume system should be taken to be Rd = {x = (x1, . . . , xd)|xj ∈R,
j = 1, . . . , d}. We denote by ˆRd = {k = (k1, . . . , kd)|kj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d}
the momentum space of one boson and work with the momentum repre-
sentation. Hence, we take the boson Fock space Fb(L2(ˆRd)) as the Hilbert
space of state vectors in the inﬁnite volume system to be considered.
968
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
We denote by Ψ0 the Fock vacuum in Fb(L2(ˆRd)):
Ψ0 := ΩL2(ˆRd)
and set
Φ( ˆf) := ΦS( ˆf),
f ∈L2(Rd).
By (5.198), we have

L2(Rd)/4eiθRe ⟨f⟩=

Ψ0, ei(Φ( ˆf)+θRe ⟨f⟩)Ψ0

Hence, (15.82) is written as

L→∞

f)Ψn,θ

=

Ψ0, ei(Φ( ˆ

,
f ∈L2
0(Rd).
As the algebra of observables in the inﬁnite volume system, we take the
Weyl algebra
W∞:= W(L2
0(Rd))
over the inner product space L2
0(Rd) as a subspace of L2(Rd).
For θ ∈R and f ∈L2
0(Rd), we deﬁne a unitary operator on Fb(L2(ˆRd))
by
Uθ(f) := eiΦ( ˆ
f)eiθRe ⟨f⟩.
(15.83)
Then, it is easy to see that, for each θ ∈R, {Uθ(f)|f ∈L2
0(Rd)} sat-
isﬁes (15.31) and (15.32) with U(f) (resp., V ) replaced by Uθ(f) (resp.,
L2
0(Rd)). Hence, by Lemma 15.6, there exists a representation πθ of W∞
on Fb(L2(ˆRd)) such that
πθ(W(f)) = Uθ(f),
f ∈L2
0(Rd).
(15.84)
By Theorem 5.27(iv), πθ is irreducible.
Lemma 15.9. For each θ ∈R \ {0} (θ ̸= 0), πθ is not regular.
Proof. We prove the lemma by reduction to absurdity. Suppose that πθ
were regular. Then, by Lemma 15.7, πθ(W(f)) is strongly continuous in
f ∈L2
0(Rd). Since e−iΦ( ˆ
f) is strongly continuous in f ∈L2
0(Rd), it follows
that e−iΦ( ˆf)πθ(W(f)) is strongly continuous in f. Hence, the functional
L2
0(Rd) ∋f →eiθRe ⟨f⟩∈C is continuous. However, if θ ̸= 0, then this is
false (see Problem 2). Hence, we arrive at a contradiction.
□
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
969
We can deﬁne a linear functional ωθ on W∞by
ωθ(W(f)) := ⟨Ψ0, πθ(W(f))Ψ0⟩,
W ∈W∞.
It follows that ωθ is a state on W∞. By Theorem 5.27(v), πθ(W∞)Ψ0 is
dense in Fb(L2(ˆRd)). Hence, (Fb(L2(ˆRd)), πθ, Ψ0) is identiﬁed with the
GNS representation associated with ωθ. Based on this fact, we write
Rωθ = (Hωθ, πωθ, Ωωθ)
with Hωθ := Fb(L2(ˆRd)), πωθ := πθ and Ωωθ := Ψ0.
The algebraic symmetry corresponding to αε,L in the ﬁnite volume sys-
tem is deﬁned by
αε(W(f)) := eiεRe ⟨f⟩W(f),
f ∈L2
0(Rd)
(15.85)
It follows that αε is a ∗-isomorphism on W∞. Hence,
πθ(αε(W(f))) = eiεRe ⟨f⟩πθ(W(f)) = πθ+ε(W(f)).
(15.86)
In contrast to the case of the ﬁnite volume system discussed in the
preceding section, the symmetry αε (ε ̸= 0) is spontaneously broken.
Theorem 15.14. Let θ ∈R and ε ∈R \ {0} be arbitrarily ﬁxed. Then, in
the phase Rωθ, the symmetry αε is spontaneously broken.
Proof. We prove the theorem by reduction to absurdity. Suppose that the
symmetry αε were not broken. Then, there exists a unitary operator U
on Fb(L2(ˆRd)) such that Uπθ(W(f))U −1 = πθ(αε(W(f))), f ∈L2
0(Rd).
Hence, UeiΦ( ˆf)U −1 = πε(W(f)). This means that πε(W(f)) is unitarily
equivalent to the Fock representation of W(L2
0(Rd)) on Fb(L2(Rd)). By
Proposition 15.9, the Fock representation is regular and, by Lemma 15.9,
πε (ε ̸= 0) is not regular. Hence, by Proposition 15.8, we arrive at a
contradiction.
□
We also note the following fact.
Theorem 15.15. If θ ̸= λ (θ, λ ∈R), then πθ and πλ are inequivalent.
Proof. Suppose that there existed a unitary transformation U such that
Uπθ(W(f))U −1 = πλ(W(f)), f ∈L2
0(Rd). Then, UeiΦ( ˆf)U −1 = πμ(W(f))
with μ := λ −θ ̸= 0. But, by the proof of Theorem 15.14, this is a
contradiction.
□
970
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Thus, we have shown that there exists a family {Rωθ}θ∈R of GNS rep-
resentations mutually inequivalent such that, in each phase Rωθ, the sym-
metry αε is spontaneously broken.
With regard to the dual transform of the state ωθ by α∗
ε, we have, by
(15.86),
α∗
εωθ = ωθ+ε.
(15.87)
Hence, the set {ωθ|θ ∈R} of states is α∗
ε-symmetric. In this sense, the
symmetry αε is maintained on the whole of the states ωθ, θ ∈R.
By Theorem 15.14, there exists no self-adjoint operator G such that
πθ(αε(W(f))) = eiεGπθ(W(f))e−iεG, f ∈L2
0(Rd),
ε ̸= 0,
(15.88)
being diﬀerent from the the case of the ﬁnite volume system (see (15.72))
But, as we shall see in the following, there is a structure which gives an
“approximate” form for (15.88). For each R > 0, we denote by 1R the
characteristic function of the set {x ∈Rd| |x| ≤R} and deﬁne
ΠR := Φ(iˆ1R).
(15.89)
Then, ΦR is self-adjoint. By Corollary 5.12, we have
eiεΠRΦ( ˆf)e−iεΠR = Φ( ˆf) + εRe ⟨1R, f⟩,
f ∈L2(Rd), ε ∈R.
Hence,
eiεΠRπθ(W(f))e−iεΠR = πθ(W(f))eiεRe ⟨1R,f⟩,
ε, θ ∈R, f ∈L2
0(Rd).

The following fact should also be noted.
Proposition 15.20. For all t ∈R, t ̸= 0,
w- lim

dense in Fb(L2(ˆRd)). Hence, by Proposition A.2 in Appendix A, (15.92)
holds.
□
Proposition 15.20 shows that there exists no self-adjoint operator G such
that, for all t ∈R \ {0}, w- limR→∞eitΠR = eitG. See also Problem 3.
15.3.4
Time development
We next consider the time development of πθ(W(f)) (θ ∈R, f ∈L2
0(Rd)).
It is natural to take as the one-boson energy a C∞-function E on ˆRd
such that
E(0) = 0.
E(k) > 0,
k ∈ˆRd \ {0}
E(k) = ϵ(k),
k ∈ΓL.
In addition, we assume the following:
(E) For all multi-indices α (see (D.1) in Appendix D), ∂αE is polynomially
bounded (see Appendix D, Section D.3.2).
The one-boson Hamiltonian in the coordinate representation is given by
hE := F −1
d EFd.
(15.93)
It follows from Fourier analysis and property (E) that, for all t ∈R, eithE
is a bijection from S (Rd) to S (ˆRd). Taking this fact into account, we con-
sider the Weyl algebra W(S (Rd)) over S (Rd) as a subspace of L2(Rd)
972
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
and, for each t ∈R, we deﬁne a mapping γt : W(S (Rd)) →W(S (Rd)) by
γt(W(f)) := W(eithEf),
W(f) ∈W(S (Rd)).
(15.94)
Then, it is easy to see that γt is a ∗-automorphisms on W(S (Rd)) and
obeys
γt+s = γtγs,
t, s ∈R.
Hence, {γt}t∈R is a one-parameter group of algebraic symmetries of
W(S (Rd)). We call it a time symmetry of the inﬁnite volume system under
consideration. The time symmetry commutes with the αε-symmetry.
Proposition 15.21. For all t, ε ∈R,
αεγt = γtαε.
(15.95)
Proof. This proposition can be proved in the same way as we proved
Proposition 15.17. The point is to prove the following equation:

eithEf

= ⟨f⟩,
f ∈S (Rd).
(15.96)
By the theory of tempered distributions (see Appendix D), (15.96) is equiv-
alent to 1(eithEf) = 1(f). By (D.25) in Appendix D, we have
1(eithEf) = ˇ1(eitE ˆf)
= (2π)d/2 ˆf(0)
(by E(0) = 0)
= 1(f).
Hence, (15.81) holds.
□
Let t, θ ∈R and f ∈S (Rd), Then, by (15.96), we have
πθ(γtW(f)) = eiΦ(eitE ˆf)eiθRe ⟨f⟩.
Applying formula (5.179) to the right-hand side, we obtain
πθ(γtW(f)) = eitH∞πθ(W(f))e−itH∞,
(15.97)
where
H∞:= dΓb(E).
(15.98)
This allows one to interpret H∞as the Hamiltonian in the phase Rωθ. We
have
H∞Ωωθ = 0.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
973
Namely, Ωωθ is a ground state of H∞. Since ker E = {0}, it follows from
(7.44) that ker H∞= {λΩωθ|λ ∈C}, i.e., the ground state of H∞is unique
in the phase Rωθ.
Note that
σ(E) = E(ˆRd) =

[0, supk∈ˆRd E(k)]
if supk∈ˆRd E(k) < ∞
[0, ∞)
if supk∈ˆRd E(k) = ∞
.
(15.99)
Hence, it follows from Theorem 5.3(i) that
σ(H∞) = [0, ∞).
(15.100)
This shows in particular that H∞has no spectral gap from the ground state
energy.
It is easy to see that ωθ is γt-invariant:
ωθ ◦γt = ωθ,
θ, t ∈R.
(15.101)
15.3.5
Representation of the translation group R1+d
For each a ∈R1+d, a mapping ϱ(a) on W(S (Rd)) is deﬁned by
ϱ(a)W(f) := W(eia0hEeia1 ˆp1 · · · eiad ˆpdf),
W(f) ∈W(S (Rd)), (15.102)
where ˆpj := iDj (see (1.90)). It follows that ϱ(a) is an algebraic symmetry
of W(S (Rd)) and {ϱ(a)}a∈R1+d is a representation of R1+d on W(S (Rd)).
Let
P0 := H∞,
Pj := −dΓb(kj),
j = 1, . . . , d,
(15.103)
where kj denotes the multiplication operator on L2(ˆRd) by the jth momen-
tum variable kj. Then, (P0, P1, . . . , Pd) is the (1+d)-tuple of strongly com-
muting self-adjoint operators. Hence, for each a = (a0, a1, . . . , ad) ∈R1+d,
U(a) := eia0P0eia1P1 · · · eiadPd
(15.104)
is a unitary operator on Fb(L2(ˆRd)) and {U(a)|a ∈R1+d} is a strongly
continuous (1 + d)-parameter unitary group on Fb(L2(ˆRd)). We have
PμΩωθ = 0,
μ = 0, 1, . . . , d.
Hence,
U(a)Ωωθ = Ωωθ,
a ∈R1+d.
974
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Since P0 is non-negative and ker E = {0}, it follows from Theorem 5.4 that,
if Ψ ∈Fb(L2(ˆRd)) satisﬁes eia0P0Ψ = Ψ, a0 ∈R, then Ψ = λΨ0 for some
λ ∈C. Hence, if Ψ ∈Fb(L2(ˆRd)) satisﬁes U(a)Ψ = Ψ for all a ∈R1+d then
Ψ = λΨ0 for some constant λ ∈C.
It is easy to see that
(πωθ ◦ϱ(a))(W(f)) = U(a)πωθ(W(f))U(a)−1,
W(f) ∈W(S (Rd)).
15.4
Order Parameter
We now proceed to formulating conditions for spontaneous symmetry
breaking in a general framework. Let A be a ∗-algebra and α be an algebraic
symmetry of A. We ﬁrst note the following.
Theorem 15.16. If a state ω ∈EA is α-invariant, then the symmetry α is
not broken in the phase Rω = (Hω, πω, Ωω).
Proof. Under the present assumption, ω(α(A)) = ω(A), A ∈A. This
implies that ⟨Ωω, (πω ◦α)(A)Ωω⟩= ω(A). Hence, by the uniqueness of
GNS representation (Theorem 15.5), there exists a unitary transformation
U on Hω such that UΩω = Ωω and Uπω(A)U −1 = πω(α(A)), A ∈A.
Hence, the symmetry α is not broken in Rω.
□
Taking the contraposition of Theorem 15.16 we obtain the following.
Corollary 15.3. Let ω ∈EA. If the symmetry α is spontaneously broken
in Rω, then ω is not α-invariant.10
It follows from the deﬁnition of α-invariance of a state that a state ω on
A is not α-invariant if and only if there exists an element A ∈A such that
ω(α(A)) ̸= ω(A).
(15.105)
The expectation value ω(A) satisfying (15.105) is called an order
parameter with respect to spontaneous symmetry breaking of the sym-
metry α. In terms of this notion, Corollary 15.3 is rephrased as follows:
a necessary condition for a spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur is
that there exists an order parameter. But we remark that an absence of
10We have encountered such a situation in the inﬁnite volume theory of a free Bose ﬁeld
discussed in Section 15.3.3.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
975
order parameter does not necessarily imply spontaneous symmetry break-
ing.11 Keeping this matter in mind, we next consider a suﬃcient condition
for spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur.
Let α be an algebraic symmetry of A, ω be a state on A and G be a
group which has a ∗-representation ϱ on A satisfying the following:
(A.1) (commutativity with α) For all g ∈G, αϱ(g) = ϱ(g)α.
(A.2) (ϱ(g)-invariance of ω) For all g ∈G, ω ◦ϱ(g) = ω.
For the GNS representation Rω := (Hω, πω, Ωω) of A, we assume the
following:
(A.3) For each g ∈G, there exists a unitary transformation U(g) on Hω
such that U(g1)U(g2) = U(g1g2), g1, g2 ∈G (i.e., {U(g)}g∈G is a
unitary representation of the group G on Hω) and the following
(i)–(iii) hold:
(i) (unitary implementability) (πω ◦ϱ(g))(A) = U(g)πω(A)U(g)−1,
g ∈G, A ∈A.
(ii) (U(g)-invariance of the cyclic vector) U(g)Ωω = Ωω, g ∈G.
(iii) (uniqueness of cyclic vector) If a non-zero vector Ψ ∈Hω satis-
ﬁes U(g)Ψ = γgΨ for all g ∈G with γg ∈C, then there exists a
constant λ ∈C such that Ψ = λΩω.
Lemma 15.10. Suppose that πω(A)′ = CI. Let Ψ ∈Hω be a cyclic vector
for πω(A) satisfying
⟨Ψ, (πω ◦ϱ(g))(A)Ψ⟩= ⟨Ψ, πω(A)Ψ⟩,
g ∈G, A ∈A.
(15.106)
Then, there exists a constant λ ∈C such that Ψ = λΩω.
Proof. Let Ψg := U(g)−1Ψ (g ∈G). Then, by (15.106) and (A.3)-(i), we
have ⟨Ψg, πω(A)Ψg⟩= ⟨Ψ, πω(A)Ψ⟩, g ∈G, A ∈A. In the same way as
in the proof of Theorem 15.5, one can show that there exists a unitary
transformation Vg on Hω such that VgΨg = Ψ, Vgπω(A)V −1
g
= πω(A), i.e.,
Vgπω(A) ⊂πω(A)Vg. Hence, Vg ∈πω(A)′. Hence, there exists a constant
γg ∈C such that Vg = γgI. This implies that U(g)Ψ = γgΨ. By this
equation and (A.3)-(iii), we obtain the desired result.
□
11For example, in the ﬁnite volume theory of a Bose ﬁeld in Section 15.3.1, the sym-
metry αε,L is not spontaneously broken; however, for f ∈L2(VL) such that Re ⟨f⟩L ̸∈
{2πn/ε|n ∈Z}, ωL,θ(αε,LW (f))) ̸= ωL,θ(W (f)). Hence, for such a function f ∈L2(VL),
ωL,θ(W (f)) is an order parameter.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem 15.17. Assume (A.1)–(A.3) and suppose that πω(A)′ = CI.
Then, if ω is not α-invariant, the symmetry α is spontaneously broken in
the phase Rω.
Proof. We prove the contraposition. Hence, suppose that the symmetry
α is not broken in Rω. Then, there exists a unitary transformation V on
Hω such that V D(πω) = D(πω) and V πω(A)Ψ = πω(α(A))V Ψ, Ψ ∈D(πω),

⟨Ψω, πω(A)Ψω⟩. On the other hand, it follows from (A.1) and A.2) that
η(ϱ(g)A) = η(A). Hence, (15.106) holds with with Ψ replaced by Ψω.
Therefore, by Lemma 15.10, there exists a constant λ ∈C such that
Ψω = λΩω(|λ| = 1). Hence, η(A) = ω(A), A ∈A, i.e., ω ◦α = ω. Thus, ω is
α-invariant.
□
Corollary 15.3 and Theorem 15.17 yield the following.
Corollary 15.4. Assume (A.1)–(A.3) with πω(A)′ = CI. Then, the sym-
metry α is spontaneously broken in the phase Rω if and only if ω is not
α-invariant.
Example 15.7. In Section 15.3.3, we have discussed the case Rω = Rωθ
(θ ∈R) with α = αε (ε ∈R \ {0}). Let G = R, the one-dimensional
translation group and ϱ(t) = γt, t ∈R. Then, (A.1) and (A.2) hold with α
(resp., ω, ϱ(g)) replaced by αε (resp., ωθ, γt). We have from (15.97)
πωθ(γt(A)) = eitH∞πωθ(A)e−itH∞,
t ∈R, A ∈W(S (Rd)).
Hence, πωθ ◦γt is unitarily implementable with U(t) = eitH∞. It follows that
(A.3) holds with U(g) replaced by U(t). Since πωθ is irreducible, it follows
that πωθ(W(S (Rd)))′ = CI. We already know that, for all ε ∈R \ {0}, ωθ
is not αε-invariant. Thus, one can apply Theorem 15.17 to conclude that,
in the phase Rωθ, the symmetry αε is spontaneously broken. This gives
another proof of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of αε in Rωθ.
Equation (15.86) implies that, for all suﬃciently small |ε|
>
0,
ωθ(αε(W(f))) ̸= ωθ(W(f) if and only if Re ⟨f⟩̸= 0. Hence, for all
f ∈S (Rd) such that Re ⟨f⟩̸= 0, ωθ(W(f)) is an order parameter with
respect to the symmetry breaking of αε with suﬃciently small |ε| > 0.
Let ΠR be the self-adjoint operator deﬁned by (15.89). Then, using
formula (5.170), we have
[ΠR, πθ(W(f))] = Re ⟨1R, f⟩πθ(W(f)).

Hence,
lim
R→∞[ΠR, πθ(W(f))]Ψ = Re ⟨f⟩πθ(W(f))Ψ,
Ψ ∈Fb,0(L2(ˆRd)).
In particular, limR→∞⟨Ψ0, [ΠR, πθ(W(f))Ψ0⟩= Re ⟨f⟩ωθ(W(f)). Hence,
Re ⟨f⟩̸= 0 ⇐⇒lim
R→∞⟨Ψ0, [ΠR, πθ(W(f))Ψ0⟩̸= 0.

Mathematical Form of Nambu–Goldstone Theorem
In this section, we give a mathematically rigorous formulation and a proof
for the statement, called Goldstone’s theorem or the Nabmu–Goldstone the-
orem in the physics literature,12 that “if there exists a spontaneous symme-
try breaking of a continuous symmetry in QFT, then a massless quantum
particle (Nambu–Goldstone particle) should be associated.”
15.5.1
Basic assumptions
Let A be a ∗-algebra and ω be a state on A. We assume that there exists
a ∗-representation {ϱ(a)|a ∈R1+d} of the (1 + d)-dimensional translation
group R1+d(d ∈N) on A and that, for each a ∈R1+d, ω is ϱ(a)-invariant.
For notational simplicity, we denote the GNS representation associated
with ω by (H , π, Ω) and assume that the following are satisﬁed:
(i) The representation π is bounded and irreducible.
(ii) There exists a strongly continuous (1 + d)-parameter unitary group
{U(a)}a∈R1+d on H such that
(π ◦ϱ(a))(A) = U(a)π(A)U(a)−1,
A ∈A, a ∈R1+d,
(15.108)
U(a)Ω = Ω,
a ∈R1+d.
(15.109)
(iii) If a non-zero vector Ψ ∈H satisﬁes U(a)Ψ = Ψ, a ∈R1+d, then
Ψ = λΩ with a constant λ ∈C.
Equation (15.108) means that π ◦ϱ(a) is unitarily implementable. One
can apply the extended Stone theorem (Theorem 1.46) to {U(a)}a∈R1+d to
conclude that there exists a unique (1 + d)-tuple P := (P0, P1, . . . , Pd) of
strongly commuting self-adjoint operators satisfying
U(a) = eia0P0eia1P1eia2P2 · · · eiadPd,
a = (a0, . . . , ad) ∈R1+d.

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In the context of QFT, P0 and P
= (P1, . . . , Pd) (or −P ) denote
the Hamiltonian and the momentum operator of the quantum system
under consideration, respectively. By the general theory of strongly com-
muting self-adjoint operators (see Section 1.8.2), U(a) has the spectral
representation
⟨Ψ, U(a)Φ⟩=

σJ(P )
eiakd ⟨Ψ, EP (k)Φ⟩,
Ψ, Φ ∈H , a ∈R1+d,
where EP is the joint spectral measure of P, σJ(P) is the joint spectrum
of P and ak := d
μ=0 aμkμ for k = (k0, k1, . . . , kd) ∈(R1+d)∗.
It follows from (15.109) and (15.110) that Ω ∈∩d
μ=0D(Pμ) and
PμΩ = 0,
μ = 0, 1, . . . , d.
(15.111)
Hence, Ω is a zero-energy state with Ω ∈∩d
μ=0 ker Pμ. Therefore 0 ∈ˆR is a
simultaneous eigenvalue of P0, P1, . . . , Pd and
0 ∈σJ(P),
EP ({0})Ω = Ω.
(15.112)
If P0 ≥0, i.e., P0 is non-negative, then Ω is a ground state of P0 and
the ground state energy is equal to zero.
In what follows, we use the following symbol: for a linear operator X
on H satisfying D(X) ∋Ω,
⟨X⟩0 := ⟨Ω, XΩ⟩H .

Heuristic arguments and remarks
Before proceeding to a mathematical formulation of the Nambu–Goldstone
theorem, we brieﬂy look at a description of the Nambu–Goldstone theo-
rem in the physics literature. A basic example of generators of continuous
symmetries in QFT is formally given by the following form:
Q =

Rd j0(t, x)dx,
(15.114)
where t ∈R is the time variable, j0(t, x) denotes the 0th component
(the charge density operator) of the current operator j(t, x) = (j0(t, x),
j1(t, x), . . ., jd(t, x))13 which is derived formally from the existence of a
13Mathematically, each jμ (μ
=
0, . . . , d) is supposed to be an operator-valued
distribution.
Mathematical Formulation of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking

continuous symmetry and satisﬁes the continuous equation:
∂tj0(t, x) +
d

ℓ=1
∂ℓjℓ(t, x) = 0
(∂t := ∂/∂t, ∂ℓ:= ∂/∂xℓ). Hence, Q is formally a conserved quantity,
i.e., a quantity independent of time t.14 The operator Q is called a charge
operator. In the physics literature, the symmetry described by Q is said to
be spontaneously broken if there exists an observable T satisfying
⟨[Q, T ]⟩0 ̸= 0
(15.115)
(it is tacitly assumed that Ω ∈D(QT ) ∩D(T Q)). This is due to the follow-
ing reasons: (i) under condition (15.115), the zero-energy state Ω cannot
be an eigenvector of Q, because, if QΩ = λΩ for some λ ∈R, then, by
the formal symmetry of Q, the left-hand side of (15.115) becomes 0, which
is a contradiction; (ii) since eitP0Qe−itP0 = Q, t ∈R (Q is assumed to be
conserved quantum mechanically too), it follows that eitP0QΩ = QΩ. This
implies that P0QΩ = 0. By (15.115), QΩ ̸= 0 and hence QΩ is also a zero-
energy state.15 As is easily seen, {Ω, QΩ} is linearly independent. Hence,
under condition (15.115), Q maps Ω to a diﬀerent zero-energy state QΩ.
This is a form of “symmetry breaking” mentioned in the physics literature.
In particular, the zero-energy state is degenerate. This kind of discussion,
however, is just a matter of formal or heuristic one. In fact, in the ﬁrst
place, the existence of Q is itself dubious. For example, in the inﬁnite vol-
ume theory of a free Bose ﬁeld discussed in Section 15.3.3, the operator
corresponding to Q should be “ limR→∞ΠR .” But such an operator does
not exist (see Proposition 15.20 and Problem 3(i)). Also, in the example, in
each phase, there exists a symmetry breaking, but the zero-energy ground
state is not degenerate. The above heuristic arguments contradicts this
fact. In fact, the degeneracy of the zero-energy state in the above sense
mentioned in the physics literature may be interpreted, in the terminology
of this book, as the existence of multiple phases, and the property that Q
maps a zero-energy state to a diﬀerent zero-energy state may correspond
to the property that the dual of an algebraic symmetry maps a state to a
diﬀerent state.
14For the counterpart in classical ﬁeld theory, see Problem 4 in this chapter, Problem
14 in Chapter 10 and Problem 5 in Chapter 12.
15For all n ∈N and t ∈R, we have eitP0Qne−itP0 = Qn. Hence, if Ω ∈D(Qn), then
eitP0QnΩ = QnΩ, implying that P0QnΩ = 0, i.e., QnΩ is a zero-energy state.

Let {βλ}λ∈R be a one-parameter group of algebraic symmetries on A,
and suppose that there exists a family {SR}R>0 of self-adjoint operators
on H such that Ω ∈D([SR, π(A)]) and
π(βλ(A)) = s- lim
R→∞eiλSRπ(A)e−iλSR,
A ∈A, λ ∈R
(see (15.91)).16 Then, the function FR(λ) :=

eiλSRπ(A)e−iSR
0 is diﬀer-
entiable with F ′
R(0) = ⟨i[SR, π(A)]⟩0. Hence, FR(λ) = FR(0) + F ′
R(0)λ +
CR(λ) (limλ→0 CR(λ)/λ = 0). Therefore,
⟨π(βλ(A))⟩0 = ⟨π(A)⟩0 + lim
R→∞⟨i[SR, π(A)]⟩0 λ + o(λ)
(λ →0),
where it is assumed that limR→∞⟨[SR, π(A)]⟩0 exists and limR→∞CR(λ) =
o(λ). Hence, if
limR→∞⟨[SR, π(A0)]⟩0 ̸= 0
(15.116)
for some A0 ∈A, then, for all suﬃciently small |λ| > 0 ⟨π(βλ(A0))⟩0 ̸=
⟨π(A0)⟩0. This means that ω is not βλ-invariant and ω(A0) is an order
parameter. Therefore, by Theorem 15.17, for all suﬃciently small |λ| > 0,
the symmetry βλ is broken, provided that the assumption in Theorem 15.17
is satisﬁed in the present context.
These heuristic arguments may allow one to regard (15.116) as an ele-
ment in a set of conditions that implies a symmetry breaking. From this
point of view, we take (15.116) as a basic assumption in what follows. The
Nambu–Goldstone theorem we formulate in the following section is con-
cerned with what condition (15.116) implies on the joint spectrum σJ(P)
of P.
15.5.3
Mathematical formulation and proof of Nambu–
Goldstone theorem
We assume that an operator-valued distribution j0 on R1+d acting in the
Hilbert space H is given with the following properties (j.1)–(j.4)17:
(j.1) For each f ∈S (R1+d), Ω ∈D(j0(f)) and, if f is real-valued, then
j0(f) is a symmetric operator on H .
16In the above context, SR is formally given by SR =

R1+d j0(t, x)u(t)fR(x)dtdx,
where u ∈S (R), fR ∈S (Rd) are real-valued and satisfy

R u(t)dt = 1, limR→∞fR(x)
= 1, x ∈Rd. Formally, we have “Q = limR→∞SR”.
17The operator-valued distribution j0 here does not necessarily represent a charge den-
sity physically.

∈
S (R1+d),
U(a)j0(f)U(a)−1 = j0(fa),
where fa is deﬁned by (8.4).
For each R > 0 and ε0 > 0, we take a real-valued function χR ∈C∞
0 (Rd)
satisfying the following:
0 ≤χR(x) ≤1,
x ∈Rd,
(15.117)
χR(x) =

(|x| ≤R)

(|x| ≥R + ε0),
x ∈Rd.
(15.118)
Using the function χR, we deﬁne an operator-valued distribution on R by
QR(u) := j0(u ⊗χR),
u ∈S (R),
(15.119)
where (u ⊗f)(x) := u(t)f(x), x = (t, x) ∈R1+d, f ∈S (Rd). We assume
the following:
(j.3) There exists an element A ∈A such that, for all f ∈S (R1+d), Ω ∈
D(j0(f)π(A)) and, for all u ∈S (R), the limit
J(u) := i lim
R→∞⟨[QR(u), π(A)]⟩0
(15.120)
exists.
(j.4) There exists a mapping J : S (R) × Rd →C; S (R) × Rd ∋(u, x) →

For f ∈S (Rd), we deﬁne a mapping Jf : S (R) × Rd →C by

0 ,
u ∈S (R), x ∈Rd,

Hence, by Fubini’s theorem and (15.123), we obtain

Remark 15.10. In the above theorem, the positivity P0 ≥0 of the Hamil-

Proof. Without loss of generality, one can assume that π(A) satisfying
(15.120) is self-adjoint (see Problem 5).
Let f ∈S (Rd) be real-valued satisfying (15.123) and u ∈S (R) be
real-valued with ˆu(0) ̸= 0. By (15.109) and the spectral representation of

Now, we prove this theorem by reduction to absurdity. Hence, suppose
that the point 0 ∈σJ(P) were an isolated point of σJ(P). Then, there exists
a constant δ > 0 such that, if 0 < |k| < δ, k ∈σJ(P)c. We take a number
ε > 0 satisfying 0 < ε < δ/

[−ε, ε] × {k ∈ˆRd| |k| ≤ε} ⊂{k ∈ˆR1+d| |k| < δ}.
There exist functions v ∈S (R) and g ∈S (Rd) satisfying the following:
ˆv(k0) = ˆv(−k0)

Let ˆJf be the Fourier transform of Jf in the sense of tempered distri-
bution (see Appendix D, Section D.8). Then,
Jf((u ∗v) ⊗g) = (2π)1/2 ˆJf((ˇuˆv) ⊗ˆg),

μ⊥(D) :=

Then, it follows that μ(D) = μ0(D) + μ⊥(D). By the uniqueness of the

It follows from this formula, Assumption (j.1) and the symmetry of π(A)
that Im μ0(D) = 0. Hence, Im μ(D) = Im μ⊥(D). Moreover, Im μ⊥
({0} = 0. Hence, it follows that supp Im μ⊥⊂{k ∈σJ(P) | |k| ≥δ}.
Therefore, we obtain from (15.130)

By the support property of ˆv and ˆg, the right-hand side is equal to 0. Hence,

Rd ˆJf(ˇuˆv, k)ˆg(k)dk = 0.
Assumption (15.126) implies that, for all h ∈S (R), J(h) = b ⟨h⟩=
b(2π)1/2ˆh(0). On the other hand, it follows from (15.124) that J(h) =
(2π)d/2 ˆJf(ˇh, 0). Hence, ˆJf(ˇh, 0) = (2π)(1−d)/2ˆh(0)b. By the integrability
of |Jf(u, x)| (u ∈S (R)) in x, ˆJf(ˇu, k) is continuous in k. Hence, for all
suﬃciently small |ε| > 0,

Rd
ˆJf(ˇuˆv, k)ˆg(k)dk ≈ˆJf(ˇuˆv, 0)

Rd ˆg(k)dk

Rd ˆg(k)dk ̸= 0.
But this is a contradiction.

Remark 15.11. In the physics literature, there are cases where, under
the name “Goldstone’s theorem,” or “the Nambu–Goldstone theorem,” the
existence of a massless boson is asserted. But Theorem 15.18 does not imply
such a strong assertion; it only suggests the existence of a massless particle.
Example 15.8. Let us show that the inﬁnite volume theory of a free Bose
ﬁeld in Section 15.3.3 satisﬁes the assumption of the Nambu–Goldstone
theorem with a suitable choice of the objects in question.
We need to consider the following case:
• A = W(S (Rd)),
H = Fb(L2(ˆRd)),
π = πωθ, Ω = Ωωθ.
• ϱ(a) deﬁned by (15.102).
• U(a) deﬁned by (15.104).
To deﬁne j0(f) in the present example, we recall some objects. We
denote by a(u) (u ∈L2(ˆRd)) the annihilation operator on Fb(L2(ˆRd))
with test vector u and deﬁne
πt(u) :=
i
√
2(a(eitEu)∗−a(eitE ˜u∗)),
t ∈R, u ∈L2(ˆRd),
where, for a function w on ˆRd, ˜w(k) := w(−k), k ∈ˆRd. Note that πt(u) ↾
Fb,0(L2(ˆRd)) is complex linear in u and, if u = ˜u∗, then πt(u) is self-adjoint.
For f ∈S (R1+d) and t ∈R, we deﬁne ft ∈S (Rd) by
ft(x) := f(t, x),
(t, x) ∈R1+d.
We denote by ˆft the Fourier transform ft.19 Using (5.82) and (5.83), one
can show that
∥πt( ˆft)Ψ∥≤
√
2∥ft∥L2(Rd)∥(Nb + 1)1/2Ψ∥,
Ψ ∈D(N 1/2

Let N > 2d. Then, we have

Let f ∈S (R1+d) be real-valued. Then, for all k ∈ˆRd, ( ˜ˆft)∗= ˆft.
Hence, πt( ˆft) is self-adjoint, implying that j0(f) is symmetric. Therefore

Let U(a) be given by (15.104) with Pμ (μ = 0, 1, . . ., d) deﬁned by

Therefore, for g ∈S (Rd) such that Re ⟨g⟩̸= 0, condition (15.126) in

present case to conclude that 0 ∈ˆR1+d is not an isolated point of the
joint spectrum of (P0, P1, . . . , Pd). We remark that, in the present example,
this fact can be derived from (15.100) too.
In a non-trivial relativistic QFT model, condition (j.4) is not expected
to hold because the distribution kernel j0(x) is usually nonlinear in a
point-wise quantum ﬁeld and hence becomes very singular so that j0(x)
itself has no mathematical meaning without regularizations and smearing
with a test function (see Problem 4). Hence, in the relativistic formula-
tions of the Nambu–Goldstone theorem, condition (j.4) has to be replaced
by another (relativistic) condition. For mathematical formulations of the
Nambu–Goldstone theorem in relativistic QFT, see, for example, Ezawa
and Swieca (1967), Strocchi (2021), and Ezawa and Arai (2023). For recent
work, see Brunetti et al. (2021) and references therein.
In this chapter, we have treated only introductory aspects in the math-
ematical theory of symmetry breaking in QFT. For further topics, such
as Higgs mechanism, which forms an essential part of the success of the
standard model of particle physics, we refer the reader to Strocchi (2013,
2021).

Appendix A
Weak Convergence of Vectors and
Strong Convergence of Bounded
Linear Operators in Hilbert Spaces
Let H be a complex Hilbert space with inner product ⟨, ⟩(linear in the
second variable) and norm ∥· ∥. A sequence {ψn}∞
n=1 of vectors ψn ∈H is
said to converge weakly to ψ ∈H if, for all φ ∈H ,
lim
n→∞⟨φ, ψn⟩= ⟨φ, ψ⟩.
(A.1)
In this case, ψ is called the weak limit of {ψn}∞
n=1, and one writes ψ =
w- limn→∞ψn.
In applications, one often meets a problem under what condition a given
sequence of vectors in a Hilbert space converges weakly. One solution to this
problem is given by the following proposition.
Proposition A.1. Let {ψn}∞
n=1 (ψn ∈H , n ∈H ) be bounded, i.e.,
supn∈N ∥ψn∥< ∞. Suppose that there exist a vector ψ ∈H
and a
dense subspace D in H
such that, for all φ ∈D, (A.1) holds. Then,
w- limn→∞ψn = ψ.
Proof. There exists a constant C > 0 such that max{∥ψ∥, supn∈N ∥ψn∥} ≤
C. Let φ ∈H . Then, by the density of D, for each ε > 0, there exists a
vector φε ∈D such that ∥φε −φ∥< ε/(3C). By the assumption on the
convergence of {ψn}n, there exists an n0(ε) ∈N such that, for all n ≥n0(ε),
| ⟨φε, ψn⟩−⟨φε, ψ⟩| < ε/3. Using the identity
⟨φ, ψn⟩−⟨φ, ψ⟩= ⟨φ −φε, ψn⟩+ (⟨φε, ψn⟩−⟨φε, ψ⟩) + ⟨φε −φ, ψ⟩
993
994
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
and the Schwarz inequality, we have for all n ≥n0(ε),
| ⟨φ, ψn⟩−⟨φ, ψ⟩| ≤∥φ −φε∥∥ψn∥+ |⟨φε, ψn⟩−⟨φε, ψ⟩| + ∥φε −φ∥∥ψ∥
< ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε.
Hence, (A.1) holds.
□
Remark A.1. The idea of the method used in the proof of Proposition A.1
is called the “ε/3 argument.” It is one of the fundamental techniques in
mathematical analysis.
Proposition A.2. Let K be a Hilbert space and Tn∈B(H , K ) (n ∈N),
with supn∈N ∥Tn∥
<
∞. Suppose that there exist an operator T
∈
B(H , K ), a dense subspace D in H
and a dense subspace F in K
such that, for all ψ ∈D and φ ∈F, limn→∞⟨φ, Tnψ⟩= ⟨φ, T ψ⟩. Then,
w- limn→∞Tn = T .
Proof. For all ψ ∈H , supn∈N ∥Tnψ∥≤(supn∈N ∥Tn∥)∥ψ∥< ∞. Hence,
by Proposition A.1, for all φ ∈K
and ψ ∈F, limn→∞⟨φ, Tnψ⟩=
⟨φ, T ψ⟩, which implies that limn→∞⟨T ∗
nφ, ψ⟩= ⟨T ∗φ, ψ⟩. Using the fact
that ∥T ∗
n∥= ∥Tn∥, we have supn∈N ∥T ∗
nφ∥≤(supn∈N ∥Tn∥)∥φ∥. Hence,
by Proposition A.1 again, w- limn→∞T ∗
nφ = T ∗φ. This is equivalent to
w- limn→∞Tn = T .
□
Proposition A.3. Let K be a Hilbert space and Tn ∈B(H , K ) (n ∈N),
with supn∈N ∥Tn∥< ∞. Suppose that there exist an operator T ∈B(H , K )
and a dense subspace D in H such that, for all ψ ∈D, limn→∞Tnψ = T ψ.
Then, s- limn→∞Tn = T .
Proof. We use the ε/3 argument mentioned in Remark A.1. Let C be a
constant satisfying C > max{supn∈N ∥Tn∥, ∥T ∥}. Let ψ ∈H . Then, for
each ε > 0, there exists a vector ψε ∈D such that ∥ψε −ψ∥< ε/(3C).
The present assumption implies that there exists an n0(ε) ∈N such that
∥Tnψε −T ψε∥< ε/3, n ≥n0(ε). Using the identity
Tnψ −T ψ = Tn(ψ −ψε) + Tnψε −T ψε + T (ψε −ψ)
Weak Convergence of Vectors and Strong Convergence
995
and the triangle inequality, we have for n ≥n0(ε),
∥Tnψ −T ψ∥≤∥Tn∥∥ψ −ψε∥+ ∥Tnψε −T ψε∥+ ∥T ∥∥ψε −ψ∥
< ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε.
Hence, the desired result follows.

Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces and
H := H1 ⊕H2 = {ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) | ψj ∈Hj, j = 1, 2}

Proof. (i) By Lemma B.1, we need only to show that D(A∗) ⊂D(B),
where B is deﬁned by (B.4). Note that, in the present case, D(A) =
D(A21)⊕D(A12) and D(B) = D(A∗

21). Let ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) ∈D(A∗).
Then, for all φ = (φ1, φ2) ∈D(A),
⟨A∗ψ, φ⟩= ⟨ψ, Aφ⟩.

Let φ2 = 0. Then, (B.6) implies that
⟨(A∗ψ)1 −A∗

Hence, ψ2 ∈D(A∗

21ψ2 = (A∗ψ)1 −A∗
11ψ1. Next, taking φ1 = 0
in (B.6) and calculating similarly, we see that ψ1 ∈D(A∗
12) and A∗
12ψ1 =
(A∗ψ)2 −A∗

(B.8)
Proof. Applying Theorem B.1(i) to the case where A11 = 0, A22 = 0,
A21 = A and A12 = A∗(note that D(A∗) is dense because A is densely
deﬁned and closed) and using the fact that (A∗)∗= A, we see that
Q∗
A = QA. Hence, QA is self-adjoint.
To prove (B.8), we ﬁrst note that (ψ1, ψ2) ∈D(Q2

D(A∗A) and ψ2 ∈D(AA∗). A simple calculation shows that Q2

(A∗Aψ1, AA∗ψ2), ψ1 ∈D(A∗A), ψ2 ∈D(AA∗). Hence, (B.8) holds.

As a corollary to Theorem B.2, one ﬁnds an easy and clear-cut proof
of the celebrated von Neumann theorem (e.g., Reed and Simon, 1975,
1000
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Theorem X.25) on the self-adjointness of A∗A, with A being a densely
deﬁned closed operator from one Hilbert space to another Hilbert space.1
Corollary B.1 (von Neumann’s theorem). Let A be a densely deﬁned
closed operator from H1 to H2. Then, A∗A is a non-negative self-adjoint
operator on H1.
Proof. The self-adjointness of QA in Theorem B.2 implies that of Q2
A.
Hence, by (B.8) and Proposition B.1, A∗A and AA∗are self-adjoint. It is
easy to show that A∗A is non-negative.

Appendix C
Absolutely Continuous Spectrum
and Singular Continuous Spectrum
of a Self-Adjoint Operator
In this appendix, we review a classiﬁcation of the spectrum of a self-adjoint
operator.
Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a complex Hilbert space H and EA
be its spectral measure. For any vector Ψ ∈H , the mapping μΨ : B1 →
[0, ∞), deﬁned by
μΨ(B) := ∥EA(B)Ψ∥2,
B ∈B1,
is a bounded measure on (R, B1).
The vector Ψ is said to be absolutely continuous with respect to A
if the measure μΨ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue
measure μL on R.
If μΨ is singular with respect to μL, then Ψ is said to be singular with
respect to A.
We denote by Hac(A) (resp., Hs(A)) the set of vectors absolutely con-
tinuous (resp., singular) with respect to A. It is easy to see that Hac(A)
and Hs(A) are subspaces of H . The subspace Hac(A) (resp., Hs(A)) is
called the absolutely continuous (resp., singular) subspace of A.
Theorem C.1.
(i) The subspaces Hac(A) and Hs(A) are mutually orthogonal closed
subspaces, and
H = Hac(A) ⊕Hs(A).
(ii) The operator A is reduced by Hac(A) and Hs(A).
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that Hac(A) ⊥Hs(A) · · · (∗).
1001
1002
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let Ψ ∈Hac(A), Φ ∈Hs(A). By the deﬁnition of a singular vector,
there exists a Borel set S0 such that μL(S0) = 0 and ∥EA(R\S0))Φ∥= 0.
Hence, EA(S0)Φ = Φ. Therefore,
⟨Ψ, Φ⟩= ⟨Ψ, EA(S0)Φ⟩= ⟨EA(S0)Ψ, Φ⟩.
Since Ψ is absolutely continuous with respect to A, ∥EA(S0)Ψ∥= 0, i.e.,
EA(S0)Ψ = 0. Hence, ⟨Ψ, Φ⟩= 0. Thus, (∗) holds.
We next show that H = Hac(A) + Hs(A) · · · (∗∗).1
Let Ξ ∈H . Then, according to Lebesgue’s decomposition theorem,
the measure μΞ is decomposed as μΞ = m1 + m2, where m1 (resp., m2)
is a measure that is absolutely continuous (resp., singular) with respect
to μL. There exists a Borel set B0 such that μL(B0) = 0 and m2(B) =
m2(B ∩B0), B ∈B1.
Put Φ := EA(B0)Ξ, Ψ := Ξ −Φ. Then,
μΦ(B) = ∥EA(B)EA(B0)Ξ∥2 = ∥EA(B ∩B0)Ξ∥2
= μΞ(B ∩B0) = m2(B ∩B0) = m2(B),
where we have used m1(B ∩B0) = 0. Hence, Φ ∈Hs(A). We also have
μΨ(B) = ∥EA(B)(1 −EA(B0))Ξ∥2 = ∥EA(B)Ξ∥2 −∥EA(B ∩B0)Ξ∥2
= μΞ(B) −m2(B) = m1(B).
Hence, Ψ ∈Hac(A). Therefore, Ξ = Ψ + Φ ∈Hac(A) + Hs(A). Thus, (∗∗)
holds.
Now, one can easily show that (∗) and (∗∗) imply the desired result.
(ii) Let P be the orthogonal projection onto Hac(H ). For all Ψ ∈
Hac(A) and B ∈B1, EA(B)Ψ ∈Hac(A). Indeed, if μL(S) = 0 (S ∈B1),
then EA(S)Ψ = 0, and hence EA(S)EA(B)Ψ = EA(B)EA(S)Ψ = 0. Hence,
EA(B)Hac(A) ⊂Hac(A). This fact and (i) imply that EA(B)Hs(A) ⊂
Hs(A). Hence, it follows that, for all B ∈B1, EA(B)P = PEA(B). By this
result and the operational calculus, we see that PA ⊂AP. Hence, Hac(A)
reduces A. By part (i), this implies the reducibility of A by Hs(A).
□
We recall that σp(A) denotes the point spectrum of A (see Section 1.1.2).
We deﬁne
Hp(A) := Ran(EA(σp(A))).
(C.1)
1For two subspaces V1 and V2 of a vector space, V1 + V2 := {v1 + v2|v1 ∈V1, v2 ∈V2}.
Absolutely Continuous Spectrum and Singular Continuous Spectrum
1003
This closed subspace is equal to the closure of the subspace spanned by all
eigenvectors of A if σp(A) ̸= ∅.
Lemma C.1. Hp(A) ⊂Hs(A).
Proof. Let AΨ = λΨ with λ ∈σp(A) and S0 := {λ}. Then, μL(S0) = 0
and ∥EA(R\S0)Ψ∥= 0. Hence, Ψ ∈Hs(A). Since Hs(A) is closed, the
desired result follows.
□
By Lemma C.1, one can deﬁne
Hsc(A) := Hp(A)⊥∩Hs(A) ⊂Hs(A).
This closed subspace is called the singular continuous subspace of A.
By Theorem C.1, H has the orthogonal decomposition
H = Hac(A) ⊕Hsc(A) ⊕Hp(A),
and each closed subspace H#(A) (# =ac, s, p) reduces A. We denote by
A# the reduced part of A to H#(A). Hence, A is written as their direct
sum:
A = Aac ⊕Asc ⊕Ap.
The operator Aac (resp., Asc, Ap) is called the absolutely continuous
part (resp., singular continuous part, point-spectral part) of A.
Thus, introducing
σac(A) := σ(Aac),
σsc(A) := σ(Asc),
σpp(A) := σ(Ap),
we have
σ(A) = σac(A) ∪σsc(A) ∪σpp(A).
(C.2)
The set σac(A) (resp., σsc(A), σpp(A)) is called the absolutely contin-
uous spectrum (resp., singular continuous spectrum, pure point
spectrum) of A.
By (1.13), Theorem 1.14(ii) and (C.2), we have
σc(A) = σac(A) ∪σsc(A).
(C.3)
We also remark that
σpp(A) = σp(A).
1004
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
If H = Hac(A), then A is said to be absolutely continuous, or to
have purely absolutely continuous spectrum.
If H = Hsc(A), then A is said to be a singular continuous, or to
have a purely singular continuous spectrum.
If H = Hp(A), then A is said to be purely point spectral.
The following fact should be kept in mind:
Theorem C.2. Suppose that A is absolutely continuous. Then, for all
Ψ, Φ ∈H ,

Φ, eitAΨ

(C.4)
Proof. By the polarization identity, it is suﬃcient to prove (C.4) in the
case where Φ = Ψ. Based on functional calculus, we have

By the absolute continuity of A, there exists a non-negative function f ∈

B ∈B1.
Hence,

Then, by the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, the right-hand side converges to

□
The absolute continuity of a self-adjoint operator is a unitary invariant
property.
Proposition C.1. Let A be an absolutely continuous self-adjoint operator
on H . Then, for any unitary operator U : H →K (a Hilbert space), the
self-adjoint operator UAU −1 on K is absolutely continuous.
Proof. The spectral measure EUAU−1 of UAU −1 is given by EUAU−1(B) =
UEA(B)U −1, B ∈B1. Hence, if the Lebesgue measure of B ∈B1 is zero,
then ∥EUAU−1(B)Φ∥= 0, for all Φ ∈K .
□
For B ∈B1, |B| denotes the Lebesgue measure of B.
Absolutely Continuous Spectrum and Singular Continuous Spectrum
1005
Proposition C.2. Suppose that A is absolutely continuous. Then, for
any real-valued continuous function f on R such that |f −1(B)| = 0 if
|B| = 0 (B ∈B1), f(A) is self-adjoint and absolutely continuous.
Proof. The self-adjointness follows from functional calculus. By Theorem
1.27, the spectral measure Ef(A) of f(A) is given by Ef(A)(B)
=
EA(f −1(B)), B ∈B1. Hence, for all ψ ∈H ,
∥Ef(A)(B)ψ∥2 = ∥EA(f −1(B))ψ∥2.
Under the present assumption, if |B| = 0, then |f −1(B)| = 0, and
hence ∥EA(f −1(B))ψ∥2 = 0, implying ∥Ef(A)(B)ψ∥2 = 0. Thus, f(A) is
absolutely continuous.
□
The following proposition gives a suﬃcient condition for a multiplication
operator on L2(Rd
k) to be absolutely continuous.
Proposition C.3. Let F be a real-valued continuous function on Rd such
that, for all f ∈L2(Rd
k),

F −1(B) |f(k)|2dk = 0 if |B| = 0 (B ∈B1). Then,
the multiplication operator MF by F on L2(Rd
k) (which is self-adjoint) is
absolutely continuous.
Proof. The spectral measure of MF is given by E(B) = χF −1(B), B ∈B1.
Hence, for all f ∈L2(Rd
k),
∥E(B)f∥2 =

F −1(B)
|f(k)|2dk.
If |B| = 0, then the right-hand side vanishes by the assumption, and hence
∥E(B)f∥2 = 0. Thus, MF is absolutely continuous.
□
Example C.1. Let m > 0 and consider the function F given by F(k) =
k2
2m, k ∈Rd. Then, using the polar coordinate in Rd, we have for all f ∈
L2(Rd
k) and B ∈B1,

where Sd−1 := {ω ∈Rd| |ω| = 1} and dS(ω) is the standard measure on
Sd−1. By change of variable, we have


F −1(B) |f(k)|2dk = 0. Thus, by Proposition C.3, the multiplication opera-

k2
2mFd = −Δ
2m, where
Fd is the d-dimensional Fourier transform and Δ is the generalized Lapla-
cian on L2(Rd

2m is absolutely
continuous.
Example C.2. Let m ≥0. Then, the multiplication operator

|k|2 + m2
on L2(Rd
k) is absolutely continuous (consider the case where F(k) =
√
k2 + m2, k ∈Rd). Hence,
√
−Δ + m2 = F −1
d

|k|2 + m2Fd is abso-

√
−Δ + m2 can also be
proved by applying Proposition C.2 to the case where A = −Δ and
f(λ) =

λ + m2.

Distributions
In this appendix, we summarize basic facts in the theory of distributions
(tempered distributions in particular).1

Deﬁnitions and examples
Let d ∈N and Rd := {x = (x1, . . . , xd)|xj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , d} be the
d-dimensional Euclidean vector space. For each j = 1, . . . , d, we denote by
∂j the partial diﬀerential operator in the variable xj:
∂j :=
∂
∂xj
.
We denote by C∞(Rd) the set of inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable functions on
Rd (C∞-functions) and introduce
C∞
0 (Rd) := {f ∈C∞(Rd)|supp f is compact},
where supp f denotes the support of f.
We denote by Z+ the set of non-negative integers: Z+ := {0} ∪N. An
element of the d direct product
Zd

(1964, 1968); Reed and Simon (1980), Chapter 5; Schwartz (1961, 1966); and Yosida and
Ito (1976).

of Z+ is called a multi-index. The norm of α ∈Z+ is deﬁned by
|α| :=
d

j=1
αj.
For each α ∈Z+, we introduce a partial diﬀerential operator ∂α as
follows:
∂α := ∂α1
1 · · · ∂αd
d .
(D.1)
It is easy to see that C∞
0 (Rd) is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex vector
space with the usual operation of addition for two functions and the usual
scalar multiplication for a function.
For each f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), we deﬁne ∥f∥0,k (k ∈Z+) by
∥f∥0,k :=
sup
x∈Rd,α∈Zd
+,|α|≤k
|∂αf(x)|.
The mapping ∥· ∥0,k : C∞
0 (Rd) →R is a norm of C∞
0 (Rd).
A sequence {fn}∞
n=1 in C∞
0 (Rd) is said to converge to f ∈C∞
0 (Rd) if
there exists a compact set K ⊂Rd such that, for all n ∈N, supp fn ⊂K
and, for all k ∈Z+, limn→∞∥fn −f∥0,k = 0.
We denote by D(Rd) the space C∞
0 (Rd) with this concept of
convergence on sequences,2 and the above convergence is written fn
D→f
(n →∞).
In general, a linear operator from a complex vector space V to C is
called a linear functional on V . The set of linear functionals on V is a
complex vector space with the usual operation of addition for two linear
operators and the usual scalar multiplication for a linear operator.
A linear functional φ on D(Rd) (φ : D(Rd) ∋f 	→φ(f) ∈C) is said to
be continuous if fn, f ∈D(Rd), fn
D→f (n →∞), then limn→∞φ(fn) =
φ(f).
A continuous linear functional on D(Rd) is called a distribution on
Rd. We denote by D′(Rd) the set of distributions on Rd.
A function in D(Rd) is called a test function in relation to D′(Rd).
The concept of support of a usual function is extended to the case of
distributions as follows.
Let D be an open set of Rd. A distribution φ ∈D′(Rd) is said to vanish
in D if φ(f) = 0, for all f ∈D(Rd), with supp f ⊂D. The support of φ,
2More precisely, D(Rd) is the topological space (C∞
0 (Rd), {∥· ∥0,k}∞
k=0) equipped with
the natural topology determined by the system {∥· ∥0,k}∞
k=0 of norms.
Elements of the Theory of Distributions

denoted by supp φ, is deﬁned to be the complement of the largest open set
on which φ vanishes.
Example D.1. A Lebesgue measurable function g on Rd is said to be
locally integrable if, for all R > 0,

|x|≤R |g(x)|dx < ∞. We denote by
L1
loc(Rd) the set of locally integrable functions on Rd. The equality g = h
for g, h ∈L1
loc(Rd) is deﬁned by g(x) = h(x) almost everywhere (a.e.)
x ∈Rd.
Let g ∈L1
loc(Rd) be ﬁxed. Then, for all f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), gf is integrable
with

Rd |g(x)f(x)|dx ≤Cf∥f∥0,0, with Cf :=

supp f |g(x)|dx. Hence,
φg(f) :=

Rd g(x)f(x)dx
is deﬁned, and |φg(f)| ≤Cf∥f∥0,0. It follows that the mapping φg : f 	→
φg(f) is linear and continuous in D(Rd). Hence, φg ∈D′(Rd).
Let φg = φh with g, h ∈L1
loc(Rd). Then,

Rd(g(x) −h(x))f(x)dx = 0,
∀f ∈D(Rd). Hence, according to the fundamental lemma of the calculus
of variations or du Bois–Reymond’s lemma,3 g(x) −h(x) = 0 a.e. x ∈Rd.
Hence, g = h. Therefore, the correspondence g 	→φg is one-to-one. In this
sense, we write
L1
loc(Rd) ⊂D′(Rd),
and each function g ∈L1
loc(Rd) can be regarded as a distribution.
It is obvious that, if supp f ⊂(supp g)c, then φg(f) = 0. Hence,
(supp g)c ⊂(supp φg)c. By using du Bois–Raymond’s lemma, one can show
that (supp φg)c ⊂(supp g)c. Hence, it follows that supp g = supp φg. Thus,
as far as locally integrable functions are concerned, the deﬁnition of the sup-
port of a distribution can be regarded as a natural extension of the concept
of support of usual functions.
Example D.2. Let a ∈Rd and δa : D(Rd) →C be deﬁned by
δa(f) := f(a),
f ∈D(Rd).
The mapping δa is linear, and
|δa(f)| ≤∥f∥0,0.
(D.2)
Hence, δa is a continuous linear functional on D(Rd), i.e., δa ∈D′(Rd).
The distribution δa is called Dirac’s delta distribution, or delta
3See, for example, Kuroda (1980), Theorem 6.5.
1010
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
distribution at a. We set
δ := δ0
(D.3)
as the delta distribution at 0.
It is easy to see that supp δa = {a}.
In the physics literature, we use the symbol δa(x) in such a way that
δa(f) =

Rd δa(x)f(x)dx
and call δa(x) “Dirac’s delta function.” However, as von Neumann already
pointed out (von Neumann, 1932, Chapter I), such a function does not
exists. To prove this, suppose that there exists such a function, δa(x).
Then, 
Rd δa(x)f(x)dx = f(a). Hence, for all f ∈C∞
0 (Rd) such that
supp f ⊂Rd \ {a}, 
Rd δa(x)f(x)dx = 0. Hence, by du Bois–Reymond’s
lemma, δa(x) = 0 a.e. x ∈Rd. Therefore, for all f ∈C∞
0 (Rd), f(a) = 0. But
this is a contradiction. Thus, δa is a distribution which cannot be regarded
as a function.
Although δa(x) is not a function, as we have seen above, it can be used as
a mere symbol. In that case, there would be no problem unless meaningless
operations such as δa(x)n (n = 1, 2, . . .) are made. The following symbol is
also used:
δa(x) = δ(x −a).
The “visual” notation used for Dirac’s delta distribution can be
extended to other distributions. Namely, for the distributions φ ∈D′(Rd)
and f ∈D(Rd), the following notation with a symbol φ(x) is sometimes
used:

Rd φ(x)f(x)dx := φ(f).
The symbol φ(x) is called the distribution kernel of φ. But one
should keep in mind that, in general, φ(x) is just a symbol which has
no mathematical meaning unless it is a locally integrable function. The
left-hand side of the above equation is just a symbolical expression
which has a mathematical meaning as an integral only if φ(x) is locally
integrable.
We sometimes use the phrase “φ(x) is a distribution on Rd” to mean
that it is the distribution kernel of a distribution φ ∈D′(Rd).
Elements of the Theory of Distributions
1011
For two distributions φ and ψ, the equality φ = ψ in D′(Rd), i.e.,
φ(f) = ψ(f), for all f ∈D(Rd), is sometimes stated as “φ(x) = ψ(x)
in the sense of distribution,” or simply “φ(x) = ψ(x).”
Example D.3. For each a > 0, there exists a mapping φa : D(R) →C
deﬁned by
φa(f) := 1
2a(f(a) + f(−a)),
f ∈D(R).
It follows that
φa = 1
2a(δa + δ−a),
(D.4)
and hence φa ∈D′(R). We have supp φa = {−a, a}.
Usually, the distribution kernel of φa is denoted δ(x2 −a2): φa(f) =

R δ(x2 −a2)f(x)dx.4 Then, by (D.4), we have
δ(x2 −a2) = 1
2a(δ(x −a) + δ(x + a)).
D.1.2
Multiplication by C∞-functions
Let u ∈C∞(Rd). Then, for all f ∈D(Rd), uf ∈D(Rd). Hence, for each
φ ∈D′(Rd), one can deﬁne uφ : D(Rd) →C by
(uφ)(f) := φ(uf),
f ∈D(Rd).
It is easy to see that uφ ∈D′(Rd). The distribution uφ is called the product
of u and φ.
D.1.3
Complex conjugation, reality and positivity
For all φ ∈D′(Rd), we deﬁne φ∗: D(Rd) →C by
φ∗(f) := φ(f ∗)∗.

It is easy to see that φ∗∈D′(Rd). The distribution φ∗is called the complex
conjugation of φ. We denote the distribution kernel of φ∗by φ(x)∗.
If φ∗= φ, then φ is said to be real.
We denote by DR(Rd) the set of real-valued test functions on Rd:
DR(Rd) := {f ∈D(Rd)|f ∗= f}.
It is easy to show that φ ∈D′(Rd) is real if and only if, for all f ∈
DR(Rd), φ(f) is a real number.
φg in Example D.1 is real if g is real. The delta distribution δa (Example
D.2) is real.
A distribution φ ∈D′(Rd) is said to be positive if, for all non-negative
functions f ∈D(Rd), φ(f) ≥0. In this case, we write φ ≥0.
The delta distribution δa on Rd (a ∈Rd) is positive.
D.1.4
Partial derivatives of distributions
For each multi-index α and φ ∈D′(Rd), a linear functional Dαφ on D(Rd)
is deﬁned by
(Dαφ)(f) := (−1)|α|φ(∂αf),
f ∈D(Rd).
It is easy to see that fn, f ∈D(Rd), fn
D
−→f (n →∞). Then, ∂αfn
D
−→
∂αf (n →∞). Hence, Dαφ is continuous on D(Rd), i.e., Dαφ ∈D′(Rd).
We call Dαφ a partial derivative of φ with order |α|.
The mapping Dα : φ 	→Dαφ (φ ∈D′(Rd)) is a linear operator from
D′(Rd) to itself. We call Dα a generalized partial diﬀerential operator
of order |α|.
If α = (0, . . . , 0, αj, 0, . . . , 0) (the components other than the jth one
are zero), then we write
Dα = Dαj
j .
It follows that, for all multi-indices α ∈Zd
+,
Dαφ = Dα1
1 · · · Dαd
d φ,
φ ∈D′(Rd),
where the order of the generalized partial diﬀerential operators appearing
on the right-hand side is arbitrary.
As is easily seen, if φ ∈D′(Rd) is a diﬀerentiable function, then each
partial derivative of φ coincides with the corresponding partial derivative
of φ in the classical sense.

In the case of d = 1, for each n ∈N, we denote by Dn the generalized
diﬀerential operator of order n on D′(R):
(Dnφ)(f) = (−1)nφ(f (n)),
f ∈D(R), φ ∈D′(R),
where f (n) denotes the derivative of f of order n. We set D := D1.
Example D.4. The Heaviside function θ : R →R is deﬁned by
θ(x) :=

1
for x ≥0;
0
for x < 0
.
It is easy to see that θ ∈D′(R) and, for all f ∈D(R),
Dθ(f) = −θ(f ′) = −
 ∞
0
f ′(x)dx = f(0) = δ(f).
Hence, Dθ = δ, i.e.,
Dθ(x) = δ(x)
in the sense of distribution.

Tempered Distributions
A complex-valued function f on Rd is said to be rapidly decreasing if
f ∈C∞(Rd) and, for all m ∈Z+ and multi-indices α ∈Zd
+,
lim
|x|→∞|x|m∂αf(x) = 0.
We denote by S (Rd) the set of rapidly decreasing functions on Rd. The
set S (Rd) is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex vector space with the usual
operation of addition for two functions and the usual scalar multiplication
for a function. It is obvious that
C∞
0 (Rd) ⊂S (Rd).
Example D.5. For each n ∈N, the function f, deﬁned by f(x) := e−|x|2n,
is in S (Rd), but f ̸∈C∞
0 (Rd).
Let f ∈S (Rd). Then, it is easy to see that, for all m ∈Z+ and any
multi-index α ∈Zd
+,
∥f∥m,α := sup
x∈Rd(1 + |x|)m |∂αf(x)|
(D.5)
is ﬁnite, and ∥· ∥m,α is a norm of S (Rd). Hence, (S (Rd), ∥· ∥m,α) is a
normed space.

A sequence {fn}n in S (Rd) (fn ∈S (Rd), n ∈N) is said to converge
to a function f ∈S (Rd) if, for all m ∈Z+ and multi-indices α ∈Zd
+,
lim
n→∞∥fn −f∥m,α = 0.
The convergence in this sense is written
fn
S
−→f (n →∞).
The space S (Rd) is sometimes called the Schwartz space of rapidly
decreasing functions.
A linear functional φ on S (Rd) is said to be continuous if fn, f ∈
S (Rd), fn
S→f (n →∞), then limn→∞φ(fn) = φ(f).
A continuous linear functional on S (Rd) is called a tempered distri-
bution on Rd. We denote by S ′(Rd) the set of tempered distributions on
Rd. An element f in S (Rd) is called a test function for S ′(Rd).
It follows that
S ′(Rd) ⊂D′(Rd),
(D.6)
i.e., any tempered distribution on Rd is a distribution on Rd.
As in the case of distributions, we mean by the phrase “φ(x) is a
tempered distribution on Rd” that it is the distribution kernel of a tempered
distribution φ ∈S ′(Rd).
The space S ′(Rd) is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex vector space.
Some typical examples of tempered distributions are discussed in the
following section.
A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a linear functional on S (Rd) to
be a tempered distribution on Rd is given by the following theorem.
Theorem D.1. Let φ be a linear functional on S (Rd). Then, φ is in
S ′(Rd) if and only if there exist an n ∈N, mj ∈Z+, α(j) ∈Zd
+ (j =
1, . . . , n) and a constant C > 0 such that
|φ(f)| ≤C
n

j=1
∥f∥mj,α(j),
f ∈S (Rd).
(D.7)
Proof. It is easy to see that (D.7) implies the continuity of φ. The converse
statement can be proved by a method similar to the one used for proving
the fact that a continuous linear operator from a normed space to a normed
space is bounded.

Since (D.6) holds, for each α ∈Zd
+ and φ ∈S ′(Rd), the partial
derivative Dαφ exists as an element of D′(Rd) a priori. But the following

Examples of Tempered Distributions
D.3.1
Lp-functions
Let 1 ≤p < ∞, d ∈N and Lp(Rd) be the set of Borel measurable functions
f on Rd such that

Rd |f(x)|pdx < ∞. For each f ∈Lp(Rd), one can deﬁne
a non-negative number ∥f∥Lp(Rd) by
∥f∥Lp(Rd) :=

Rd |f(x)|pdx
1/p
.
We denote by L∞(Rd) the set of Borel measurable functions f on Rd
such that the essential supremum
∥f∥L∞(Rd) := ess.supx∈Rd|f(x)|
of f is ﬁnite. It is obvious that
S (Rd) ⊂L∞(Rd).
As for Lp(Rd) with 1 ≤p < ∞, we have the following lemma:
Lemma D.1. Let 1 ≤p < ∞. Then, S (Rd) ⊂Lp(Rd) and, for all m ∈N
with m > d/p,
∥f∥Lp(Rd) ≤cm,p∥f∥m,0,
f ∈S (Rd),
where
cm,p :=

Rd(1 + |x|)−mpdx
1/p
.
Proof. Let f ∈S (Rd) and 1 ≤p < ∞. Then,

Rd |f(x)|pdx =

Rd(1 + |x|)−mp ( (1 + |x|)m|f(x)| )p dx
≤∥f∥p
m,0

Rd(1 + |x|)−mpdx = cp
m,p∥f∥p
m,0 < ∞.
Hence, the desired result follows.

Let g ∈Lp(Rd) (1 ≤p < ∞) and q > 1 be deﬁned by
1
p + 1
q = 1.
Let f ∈S (Rd). Then, using H¨older’s inequality,

Rd |g(x)f(x)|dx ≤∥g∥Lp(Rd)∥f∥Lq(Rd) ≤∥g∥Lp(Rd)cm,q∥f∥m,0 < ∞,
where, in the last inequality, we have used Lemma D.1. Hence, according
to Theorem D.1, the functional φg : S (Rd) →C, deﬁned by
φg(f) :=

Rd g(x)f(x)dx,
f ∈S (Rd),
(D.8)
is a tempered distribution on Rd (the linearity φg(f) in f is easily seen).
In the case where g ∈L∞(Rd), we have

Rd |g(x)f(x)|dx ≤∥g∥L∞(Rd)cm,1∥f∥m,0,
m > d.
Hence, in this case too, φg is a tempered distribution on Rd.
By using H¨older’s inequality, one can easily show that
Lp(Rd) ⊂L1
loc(Rd),
1 ≤p ≤∞.
In the same way as in the case of φg with g ∈L1
loc(Rd), one can show
that the correspondence Lp(Rd) ∋g 	→φg ∈S ′(Rd) (1 ≤p ≤∞) is
one-to-one. In this sense, we have
Lp(Rd) ⊂S ′(Rd),
1 ≤p ≤∞.
We remark that there are locally integrable functions which are not
tempered distributions. For example, the function g deﬁned by g(x) =
ex2, x ∈Rd, is locally integrable, but φg ̸∈S ′(Rd).
D.3.2
Polynomially bounded functions
A function g : Rd →C is said to be polynomially bounded if it is Borel
measurable and, for some p ∈N and a constant C > 0,
|g(x)| ≤C(1 + |x|)p,
x ∈Rd.
(D.9)
Elements of the Theory of Distributions

Let g : Rd →C be polynomially bounded satisfying (D.9). Then, for all
f ∈S (Rd) and m > d,

Rd |g(x)| |f(x)|dx ≤

Rd C(1 + |x|)−m(1 + |x|)p+m|f(x)|dx
≤Ccm,1∥f∥p+m,0 < ∞.
Hence, according to Theorem D.1, φg : S (Rd) →C, deﬁned by (D.8), is
a tempered distribution on Rd. In this sense, g is said to be a tempered
distribution, and one writes g ∈S ′(Rd).
D.3.3
Delta distributions
(1) For all f ∈S (Rd) too, (D.2) holds. Hence, for all a ∈Rd, δa ∈S ′(Rd).
(2) We deﬁne a mapping φ0 : S (R2d) →C by
φ0(f) :=

Rd f(x, x)dx,
f ∈S (R2d).
Let m > d. Then,
|f(x, x)| =
1
(1 +

|x|2 + |x|2)m (1 +

|x|2 + |x|2)m|f(x, x)|
≤
∥f∥m,0
(1 +
√
2|x|)m .
Hence |φ0(f)| ≤cm,1∥f∥m,0. Hence, according to Theorem D.1, φ0 ∈
S ′(R2d). The distribution kernel of φ0 is denoted δ(x −y):

R2d δ(x −y)f(x, y)dx dy := φ0(f) =

Rd f(x, x)dx.
We call φ0 the diagonal delta distribution on R2d.
(3) We next consider a generalization of φ0. For each p = 1, . . . , n and
f ∈S (Rd(n+p)), we deﬁne a function f (p) on Rdn by
f (p)(x1, . . . , xn) := f(x1, . . . , xn, xi1, . . . , xip),
xj ∈Rd, j = 1, . . . , n,
where {xi1, . . . , xip} ⊂{x1, . . . , xn} such that i1 < i2 < · · · < ip. It is
easy to see that f (p) ∈S (Rdn). Hence, for all F ∈S ′(Rdn), a mapping

φ(p)
F
: S (Rd(n+p)) →C is deﬁned by
φ(p)
F (f) := F(f (p)),
f ∈S (Rd(n+p)).
One can show that, if fk, f ∈S (Rd(n+p)), fk
S→f (k →∞), then
f (p)
k
S→f (p) (k →∞). Hence, φ(p)
F (fk) →φ(p)
F (f) (k →∞). Therefore,
φ(p)
F
∈S ′(Rd(n+p)). We denote the distribution kernel of φ(p)
F
by
F(x1, . . . , xn)δ(xn+1 −xi1) · · · δ(xn+p −xip),
where F(x1, . . . , xn) is the distribution kernel of F. Hence, as
symbolical expressions, we have
φ(p)
F (f) =

Rd(n+p) F(x1, . . . , xn)δ(xn+1 −xi1) · · · δ(xn+p −xip)
×f(x1, . . . , xn, xn+1, . . . , xn+p)dx1 · · · dxn+p
=

Rdn F(x1, . . . , xn)f(x1, . . . , xn, xi1, . . . , xip)dx1 · · · dxn.
(4) Let x = (t, x) ∈R × Rd = R1+d and g be a function on (0, ∞) such
that, for some n ≥1,
Id(g) :=
 ∞

|g(r)|
(1 + r)n rd−1dr < ∞.
Let ρ : [0, ∞) →R and f ∈S (R × Rd). Using the polar coordinate in
Rd, we have

Rd |g(|x|)f(ρ(|x|), x)|dx =

|ω|=1
|g(r)f(ρ(r), rω)|rd−1drdS(ω),
where

|ω|=1 dS(ω) means the surface integral on {ω ∈Rd| |ω| = 1}.
We have
|f(ρ(r), rω)| = (1 +

ρ(r)2 + |rω|2)n

Hence, letting C :=

|ω|=1 1 dS(ω), we have

Rd |g(|x|)f(ρ(|x|), x)|dx ≤C∥f∥n,0Id(g) < ∞.
Therefore, the mapping Dg,ρ : S (R1+d) →C, deﬁned by
Dg,ρ(f) :=

Rd g(|x|)f(ρ(|x|), x)dx,
f ∈S (R1+d),
is a tempered distribution on R1+d. The distribution kernel of Dg,ρ is
written as g(|x|)δ(t −ρ(|x|)) (= g(|x|)δ(ρ(|x|) −t)). The distribution
kernel of Dg,−ρ is written as g(|x|)δ(t + ρ(|x|)).
Let ρ > 0 and u(x) := ρ(|x|), x ∈Rd. Then, as a (1+d)-dimensional
extension of Example D.3, we deﬁne
δ(t2 −u(x)2) :=
1
2u(x)[δ(t −u(x)) + δ(t + u(x))],
provided that
 ∞

ρ(r)(1 + r)n rd−1dr < ∞.
By the above facts, δ(t2 −u(x)2) is a tempered distribution on R1+d.

Product with polynomially bounded C∞-functions
Let u be a polynomially bounded C∞-function Rd such that, for all
multi-indices α ∈Zd

multi-index α ∈Zd

|∂αu(x)| ≤Cα(1 + |x|)pα,

Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
For each φ ∈S ′(Rd), we deﬁne uφ : S (Rd) →C by
(uφ)(f) := φ(uf),
f ∈S (Rd).
Obviously (uφ)(f) is linear in f. If fn, f ∈S (Rd), fn
S→f (n →∞), then,
by (D.10), ufn
S→uf (n →∞) and hence φ(ufn) →φ(uf) (n →∞),
i.e., (uφ)(fn) →(uφ)(f) (n →∞). Therefore, uφ ∈S ′(Rd). We call the
tempered distribution uφ the product of u and φ.
D.4.2
Transformations
Let T : Rd →Rd be an injective linear mapping and a ∈Rd. Then, T is
bijective since Rd is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space. For each function f
on Rd, one can deﬁne a function f(a,T ) on Rd by
f(a,T )(x) := f(T −1(x −a)),
x ∈Rd.
(D.11)
It is easy to see that, if f ∈S (Rd), then f(a,T ) ∈S (Rd). Hence, one
can deﬁne a mapping φ(a,T ) : S (Rd) →C by
φ(a,T )(f) := φ(f(a,T )),
f ∈S (Rd).
It follows that φ(a,T ) ∈S ′(Rd).
Symbolically we have φ(f(a,T )) =

Rd φ(x)f(T −1(x −a))dx. Hence,
heuristically, the change of variable T −1(x −a) →x gives
φ(f(a,T )) =

Rd φ(T x + a)f(x)| det T |dx.
Hence, the distribution kernel of φ(a,T ) is given by | det T |φ(T x+a) in terms
of the distribution kernel φ(x) of φ:
φ(a,T )(x) = | det T |φ(T x + a).
The tempered distribution φ(a,I) (the case of T = I) is called the
translation of φ by the vector a.
If T is a rotation on Rd (i.e., T ∈SO(d)), then φ(0,T ) is called the
rotation of φ with T .
The tempered distribution φ(0,−I) (the case of a = 0, T = −I) is called
the space inversion of φ.
Elements of the Theory of Distributions
1021
Deﬁnition D.1. Let φ ∈S ′(Rd).
(i) The distribution φ is said to be translation invariant if φ(a,I) = φ,
for all a ∈Rd.
(ii) The distribution φ is said to be rotation invariant if φ(0,T ) = φ, for
all T ∈SO(d).
(iii) Let G be a linear transformation group on Rd. Then, φ is said to be
G-invariant if φ(0,T ) = φ, for all T ∈G.
Proposition D.1. If φ ∈S ′(Rd) is translation invariant, then φ is a
constant function.
Remark D.1. The operations described in this section are also deﬁned for
distributions.
D.5
Rd-Translation Invariant Tempered Distributions
For each a ∈Rd and a function f on (Rd)n, we deﬁne a function Ud(a)f on
(Rd)n by
(Ud(a)f)(x1, . . . , xn) = f(x1 −a, x2 −a, . . . , xn −a), (x1, . . . , xn) ∈(Rd)n.
We call Ud(a)f the Rd-translation of f with vector a ∈Rd.
Throughout this section, W ((Rd)n) denotes D((Rd)n) or S ((Rd)n).
It is obvious that, if f ∈W ((Rd)n), then Ud(a)f ∈W ((Rd)n). Hence,
for each φ ∈W ′((Rd)n), one can deﬁne a mapping φa : W ((Rd)n) →C by
φa(f) := φ(Ud(a)f),
f ∈W ((Rd)n).
It is easy to see that φa ∈W ′((Rd)n). We call the distribution φa the
Rd-translation of φ. The distribution kernel of φa is given by φ(x1 +
a, . . . , xn + a):
φa(f) =

(Rd)n φ(x1 + a, . . . , xn + a)f(x1, . . . , xn)dx1 · · · dxn.
A distribution φ ∈W ′((Rd)n) is said to be Rd-translation invariant
if φa = φ, for all a ∈Rd (i.e., φa(f) = φ(f), for all f ∈W ((Rd)n) and
a ∈Rd).
1022
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
In terms of the distribution kernel φ(x1, . . . , xn) of φ, the Rd-translation
invariance of φ is written
φ(x1 + a, x2 + a, . . . , xn + a) = φ(x1, . . . , xn),
a ∈Rd.
(D.12)
Proposition D.2. Let n ≥2 and φ be an Rd-invariant function on
(Rd)n. Then, there exists a function on ψ on (Rd)n−1 such that, for all
(x1, . . . , xn) ∈(Rd)n,
φ(x1, . . . , xn) = ψ(x2 −x1, x3 −x1, . . . , xn −x1).
(D.13)
Proof. One needs only to take a = −x1 in (D.12) and deﬁne a function
ψ on (Rd)n−1 by ψ(y1, . . . , yn−1) := φ(0, y1, . . . , yn−1), (y1, . . . , yn−1) ∈
(Rd)n−1.
□
The above proposition shows that an Rd-invariant function on (Rd)n
is a function of (n −1) independent diﬀerence variables. This struc-
ture is extended to the case where φ is an Rd-invariant distribution, as
follows.
Theorem D.3. Let n ≥2 and φ ∈W ′((Rd)n) be an Rd-invariant distri-
bution. Then, there exists a distribution ψ ∈W ′((Rd)n−1) such that
φ(f) = ψ(I(f)),
f ∈W ((Rd)n),
(D.14)
where I(f) ∈W ((Rd)n−1) is deﬁned by
I(f)(y1, . . . , yn−1) :=

Rd f(x, y1 + x, . . . , yn−1 + x)dx,
(y1, . . . , yn−1) ∈(Rd)n−1.
Remark D.2. In terms of distribution kernels, (D.14) is written as (D.13).
D.6
Convergence in S ′(Rd)
A sequence {φn}∞
n=1 in S ′(Rd) is said to converge to φ ∈S ′(Rd) if, for
all f ∈S (Rd), limn→∞φn(f) →φ(f). We write this as φn
S ′
−→φ (n →∞),
or limn→∞φn = φ, in S ′(Rd). In terms of distribution kernels, we write
φn(x)
S ′
→φ(x) (n →∞), or limn→∞φn(x) = φ(x), in S ′(Rd).

|p.v. (f)| ≤2(∥f ′∥∞+ ma∥f∥1,0).
Thus, the mapping S (R) ∋f 	→p.v. (f) is a tempered distribution on
R. This distribution is called the principal value distribution at a. We
denote its distribution kernel by p.v. 1/(x −a).

sequence in C.
An important property of S ′(Rd) is given by the following theorem.
Theorem D.4. Every Cauchy sequence {φn}∞
n=1 in S ′(Rd) is a convergent
sequence. Namely, there exists a unique element φ ∈S ′(Rd) such that
limn→∞φn = φ in S ′(Rd).
The property stated in this theorem is called the completeness of
S ′(Rd).

The Schwartz Nuclear Theorem
Let n ≥2, dj ∈N, j = 1, . . . , n and F be an n-linear form on the direct
product
S (Rd1) × · · · × S (Rdn)
(see Remark 2.4). Then, F is said to be separately continuous if, for
each j = 1, . . . , n and fk ∈S (Rdk), k ̸= j, the mapping S (Rdj) ∋fj 	→
F(f1, . . . , fj, . . . fn) is continuous in the topology of S (Rdj).
The following theorem is an important theorem, which is an extension
of a separately continuous multi-linear form on S (Rd1) × · · · × S (Rdn) to
a tempered distribution on Rd1+···+dn.
Elements of the Theory of Distributions

Theorem D.5 (the Schwartz nuclear theorem). Let n ≥2 and F be
a separately continuous n-linear form on S (Rd1) × · · · × S (Rdn). Then,
there exists a unique tempered distribution φ ∈S ′(Rd1+···+dn) such that,
for all fj ∈S (Rdj), j = 1, . . . , n,
φ(f1 × · · · × fn) = F(f1, . . . , fn),
where
(f1 × · · · × fn)(x1, . . . , xn) = f1(x1) · · · fn(xn), xj ∈Rdj, j = 1, . . . , n.
For a proof of this theorem, see, for example, Reed and Simon (1980),
Theorem V.1.
Corollary D.1. Let φ, ψ
∈
S ′(Rd1+···+dn) such that, for all fj
∈
S (Rdj), j = 1, . . . , n, φ(f1 × · · · × fn) = ψ(f1 × · · · × fn). Then, φ = ψ.
Proof. This follows from the uniqueness property in the Schwartz nuclear
theorem.
□
Example D.10. Let
F(f, g) :=

Rd f(x)g(x)dx,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Then, in terms of the notation in Section D.3.1, F(f, g) = φg(f) = φg(f).
Hence, it follows that F is a separately continuous bilinear form on S (Rd)×
S (Rd). Therefore, according to the Schwartz nuclear theorem, there exists a
unique tempered distribution δdiag on R2d such that δdiag(f×g) = F(f, g) =

Rd f(x)g(x)dx, f, g ∈S (Rd). The delta distribution φ0 on R2d discussed
in Section D.3.3 satisﬁes φ0(f × g) =

Rd f(x)g(x)dx, f, g ∈S (Rd). Hence,
δdiag = φ0.

Rd e−ikxf(x)dx,
k = (k1, . . . , kd) ∈Rd

is called the Fourier transform of f, where kx = d
j=1 kjxj (the
Euclidean inner product of k and x). It is shown that ˆf ∈S (Rd). Hence,
1028
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
we deﬁne a mapping Fd : S (Rd) →S (Rd) by
Fdf := ˆf,
f ∈S (Rd).
The mapping Fd is called the Fourier transform on S (Rd).
Proposition D.3. The Fourier transform Fd on S (Rd) is bijective and,
for all f ∈S (Rd),
f(x) =
1
(2π)d/2

Rd eikx ˆf(k)dk,
f ∈S (Rd).
(D.18)
Moreover, Fd preserves the inner product ⟨· , ·⟩of L2(Rd):
⟨Fdf, Fdg⟩= ⟨f, g⟩,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Formula (D.18) is called the Fourier inversion formula. This formula
implies that the inverse Fourier transform F −1
d
is given by
(F −1


Rd eikxg(k)dk,
g ∈S (Rd).
Note that
ˆg(x) = ˇg(−x),
x ∈Rd.
(D.19)
Remark D.4. (i) It follows from Proposition D.3 and the extension theo-
rem of a densely deﬁned bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space that
Fd is uniquely extended to a unitary operator on L2(Rd). This unitary
extension is denoted by the same symbol Fd. For an element f ∈L2(Rd),
we deﬁne ˆf ∈L2(Rd) by ˆf := Fdf, f ∈L2(Rd). However, in this case,
(D.17) does not hold in general. Instead, the following formula holds:

(ii) Since we have
∥Fdf∥L∞(Rd) ≤
1
(2π)d/2 ∥f∥L1(Rd),
f ∈S (Rd)
and S (Rd) is dense in L1(Rd), Fd can be extended uniquely to a bounded
linear operator from L1(Rd) to L∞(Rd). This extension is also denoted by
the same symbol: Fd. In this case, one sees that (D.17) continues to hold:
ˆf(k) := (Fdf)(k) =

It is easy to see that, for all multi-indices α, β ∈Zd
+,
kα∂β
k ˆf(k) = (−i)|α|(−i)|β|(Fd(∂αxβf))(k),
k ∈Rd,

Using these inequalities, one can prove the following proposition:
Lemma D.3. For each m ∈Z+ and α ∈Zd
+, there exist constants N ∈N,
Cj > 0, mj, ∈N and α(j) ∈Zd
+ (j = 1, . . . , N) such that

∥f∥m,α ≤

Cj∥ˆf∥mj,α(j),
f ∈S (Rd).
(D.21)
Thus, the following proposition is proved:

and only if ˆfn
S

D.8.2
Fourier transform of tempered distributions
For each tempered distribution φ ∈S ′(Rd), there is a linear functional ˆφ
on S (Rd) given by
ˆφ(f) := φ( ˆf),
f ∈S (Rd),
By Proposition D.4, ˆφ is a tempered distribution, i.e., ˆφ ∈S ′(Rd). The
tempered distribution ˆφ is called the Fourier transform of φ. Hence, a
mapping F ′
d : S ′(Rd) →S ′(Rd) is deﬁned by
F ′
dφ := ˆφ,
φ ∈S ′(Rd).
This mapping is called the Fourier transform on S ′(Rd).
Remark D.5. If φ ∈L2(Rd) ∪L1(Rd), then ˆφ ∈S ′(Rd) is identiﬁed with
the Fourier transform of φ deﬁned in Remark D.4. Hence, the notation is
consistent.
Theorem D.6. The Fourier transform F ′
d on S ′(Rd) is bijective and
continuous.
The inverse mapping (F ′
d)−1 : S ′(Rd) →S ′(Rd) is called the inverse
Fourier transform on S ′(Rd). We have
(F ′
d)−1φ(f) = φ( ˇf),
f ∈S (Rd), φ ∈S ′(Rd).
We write
ˇφ := (F ′
d)−1φ.
(D.22)
Hence,
ˇφ(f) = φ( ˇf),
f ∈S (Rd).
Elements of the Theory of Distributions
1031
It follows that ˇφ(f) = ˆφ( ˜f), where ˜f(k) := f(−k), k ∈Rd. In terms of
distribution kernels ˇφ(k) and ˆφ(k), this is written as
ˆφ(k) = ˇφ(−k).
(D.23)
Hence, (D.19) extends to tempered distributions.
Example D.11 (Fourier transform of constant functions). For
a
constant C ∈C, we denote by FC the constant function on Rd with value
C: FC(x) := C, x ∈Rd. It is obvious that FC is polynomially bounded.
Hence, FC ∈S ′(Rd) (see Section D.3.2). Let us ﬁnd the Fourier transform
of FC. For all f ∈S (Rd), we have
ˆFC(f) = FC( ˆf) =

Rd C ˆf(k)dk = C(2π)d/2f(0) = C(2π)d/2δ(f).
Hence,
ˆFC = (2π)d/2Cδ.
(D.24)
By abuse of notation, we sometimes write C for FC and ˆC = ˆFC, ˇC = ˇFC.
Hence,
ˆC = (2π)d/2δ,
ˇC == (2π)d/2δ.
In particular, for the constant function 1,
ˆ1 = ˇ1 = (2π)d/2δ.
(D.25)

Rd. Then, for all f ∈S (Rd),
ˆδa(f) = δa( ˆf) = ˆf(a) =
1
(2π)d/2

Hence, ˆδa is identiﬁed with the function

Convolution of functions in S (Rd)
For functions f, g ∈S (Rd), a function f ∗g on Rd is deﬁned by
(f ∗g)(x) :=

Rd f(x −y)g(y)dy,
x ∈Rd.
The function f ∗g is called the convolution of f and g. It is easy to see
that
f ∗g = g ∗f.
It is not so diﬃcult to prove the following facts5:
(C.1) For each f ∈S (Rd), the mapping g →f ∗g is a continuous linear
operator from S (Rd) to S (Rd).

D.9.2
Convolution of a tempered distribution and a rapidly
decreasing function
For each f ∈S (Rd), we deﬁne a function f ∈S (Rd) by
f(x) := f(−x),
x ∈Rd.
By property (C.1) mentioned above, f ∗g ∈S (Rd). If φ is an integrable
function on Rd, then

Rd(φ ∗f)(x)g(x)dx =

Rd φ(x)( f ∗g)(x)dx,
f, g ∈S (Rd).
Based on this fact, for each φ ∈S ′(Rd), a mapping φ ∗f : S (Rd) →C is
deﬁned by
(φ ∗f)(g) := φ( f ∗g),
g ∈S (Rd).
The mapping φ ∗g is continuous and linear, namely, φ ∗f ∈S ′(Rd). We
call the tempered distribution φ ∗f the convolution of φ and f. This is a
natural extension of the concept of convolution for functions in S (Rd).
For a function f ∈S (Rd) and a point y ∈Rd, a function fy on Rd is
deﬁned by
fy(x) := f(y −x),
x ∈Rd.
The following theorem holds.6
Theorem D.7. For each f ∈S (Rd), the mapping: φ 	→φ∗f (φ ∈S ′(Rd))
is a continuous linear operator from S ′(Rd) to S ′(Rd). Moreover, the fol-

(i) The
convolution
φ ∗f
is
polynomially
bounded

Dα(φ ∗f) = (Dαφ) ∗f = φ ∗Dαf.

Example D.13. Let δ be a d-dimensional delta distribution. Then, for all

Applications: Fundamental solutions for partial
diﬀerential operators
Let P(x) be a polynomial of d real variables x = (x1, . . . , xd) and P(D) be
the partial diﬀerential operator obtained by replacing xj in P(x) with Dj:
P(D) := P(D1, . . . , Dd).
A distribution E
∈
D′(Rd) satisfying the distributional partial
diﬀerential equation
P(D)E = δ
is called a fundamental solution for P(D), where δ is the d-dimensional
delta distribution. Namely, E ∈D′(Rd) is a fundamental solution for P(D)
if, for all f ∈D(Rd),
E(P(−D)f) = f(0),
where P(−D) := P(−D1, . . . , −Dd).
Remark D.6. A fundamental solution for P(D) is not necessarily unique.
For example, if E is a fundamental solution for P(D), then for all u ∈
D′(Rd), satisfying P(D)u = 0, E + u is a fundamental solution for P(D).
See also Example D.14 as follows.
Proposition D.5. Let E ∈S ′(Rd) be a fundamental solution for P(D).
Then, for all f ∈S (Rd), u = E ∗f is a polynomially bounded C∞function
satisfying
P(D)u = f.
Proof. The ﬁrst half of the assertion is due to Theorem D.7(i). Theorem
D.7(i) also implies that
P(D)u = P(D)(E ∗f) = (P(D)E) ∗f = δ ∗f = f.
□
Example D.14. By Example D.4, the Heaviside function θ(x) is a

Let (X, Σ, μ) be a σ-ﬁnite measure space and H be a separable Hilbert
space. We denote by L1(X, dμ; H ) the set of H -valued Σ-measurable
functions F on X (see Section 2.7) such that

X
∥F(x)∥dμ(x) < ∞.
Let F ∈L1(X, dμ; H ) and {en}∞
n=1 be a CONS of H . Then, one has the
expansion
F(x) =
∞

n=1
⟨en, F(x)⟩en,
x ∈X.
The function : x 	→⟨en, F(x)⟩is Σ-measurable and | ⟨en, F(x)⟩| ≤∥F(x)∥.
Hence,

X
| ⟨en, F(x)⟩|dμ(x) ≤

X
∥F(x)∥dμ(x) < ∞.

Lemma E.1. The limit

n=1.


X
dμ(y) ⟨F(y), GN,M(x)⟩,
where GN,M(x) := M
n=N+1 ⟨en, F(x)⟩en. Note that the following facts
hold:
lim
M,N→∞GN,M(x) = 0,
∥GN,M(x)∥≤∥F(x)∥
(by Bessel’s inequality).
Hence, | ⟨F(y), GN,M(x)⟩| ≤∥F(y)∥∥F(x)∥. The function on the right-
hand side is integrable with respect to the measure dμ(x) dμ(y). Therefore,
according to the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,
lim
M,N→∞

X
dμ(x)

X
dμ(y) ⟨F(y), GN,M(x)⟩= 0.
This means that ∥IM(F)−IN(F)∥2 →0 (M, N →∞). Thus, {IN(F)}∞
N=1
is a Cauchy sequence.
By the preceding result, the limit I(F) of {IN(F)}N exists. To show
that I(F) is independent of the choice of the CONS {en}∞
n=1, let {fn}∞

The vector

Bochner integral of F with respect to μ.

Representations of Linear Lie Groups
and Lie Algebras
F.1
A Linear Lie Group and Its Lie Algebra
For a natural number n ∈N, we denote by GL(n, C) the set of all complex
n×n invertible (regular) matrices. This set forms a group with the product
operation of matrices. The group GL(n, C) is called the general linear
group of degree n.
A subgroup G of GL(n, C) is called a linear Lie group of degree n if
it is a closed set in GL(n, C) in the standard topology of the matrix space
Mn(C).
Example F.1. The following sets are linear Lie groups of degree n:
(i) GL(n, R) := {A ∈Mn(R)|A is invertible}.
(ii) SL(n, K) := {A ∈Mn(K)| det A = 1} (K = C or R). This group is
called the special linear group of degree n, or the n-dimensional
special linear group.
(iii) O(n) := {R ∈Mn(R)|tRR = In}, where tR is the transposed matrix
of R and In denotes the n×n identity matrix. This group is called the
orthogonal group of degree n, or the n-dimensional orthogonal
group.
(iv) SO(n) := {R ∈O(n)| det R = 1}. This group is called the special
orthogonal group of degree n, or the n-dimensional rotation
group.
(v) U(n) := {U ∈Mn(C)|U ∗U = In}, where U ∗is the adjoint of U. This
group is called the n-dimensional unitary group.
(vi) SU(n)
:=
{U
∈
U(n)| det U
=
1}. This group is called the
n-dimensional special unitary group.
1043
1044
Analysis on Fock Spaces and Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields
Let G be a linear Lie group of degree n. Then, it can be shown that
the set
g := {X ∈Mn(C)|etX ∈G, ∀t ∈R}
is a real Lie algebra with commutator bracket.1 This Lie algebra is called
the Lie algebra of G.
Example F.2.
(i) The Lie algebra of GL(n, K) is gl(n, K) := Mn(K).
(ii) The Lie algebra SL(n, K) is sl(n, K) := {X ∈Mn(K)|Tr X = 0}.
(iii) The Lie algebra of O(n) is o(n) := {X ∈Mn(R)|tX = −X}.
(iv) The Lie algebra so(n) of SO(n) is equal to o(n).
(v) The Lie algebra of U(n) is u(n) := {X ∈Mn(C)|X∗= −X}.
(vi) The Lie algebra of SU(n) is su(n) := {X ∈u(n)|Tr X = 0}.
An important relation between a linear Lie group and its Lie algebra is
given by the following theorem.2
Theorem F.1. Let G be a connected linear Lie group and g be its Lie
algebra. Then, for any element g in G, there exist elements X1, . . . , XN ∈g
such that g = eX1eX2 · · · eXN.
F.2
Diﬀerential Representation of Lie Algebras
Let G be a linear Lie group and g be its Lie algebra. Let ρ : G →
GL(V ) be a continuous representation of G (see Section 2.9.2) with V a
ﬁnite-dimensional vector space. Then, it can be shown that, for all X ∈g,
σ(X) := lim
t→0
1
t

ρ(etX) −1

exists, σ(X) ∈gl(V ) (the Lie algebra of everywhere deﬁned linear operators
on V ), and
ρ(etX) = etσ(X),
t ∈R, X ∈g.
1See, for example, Yamanouchi and Sugiura (1960), p. 91, [V].
2For a proof, see, for example, Yamanouchi and Sugiura (1960), p. 104, [V].
Representations of Linear Lie Groups and Lie Algebras
1045
Moreover, the mapping σ : g →gl(V ) is a representation of g (see
Section 4.13). The representation σ is called the diﬀerential represen-
tation of ρ and denoted as σ = dρ.
Since ρ is continuous, it follows that the kernel N(ρ) of ρ is a linear
Lie group. We denote the Lie algebra of N(ρ) by n(ρ). There is a beautiful
relation between n(ρ) and dρ:
Theorem F.2. n(ρ) = {X ∈gl(V )|dρ(X) = 0}(= ker dρ).
For a proof of this theorem, see, for example, Yamanouchi and Sugiura
(1960), p. 118, [VII].
