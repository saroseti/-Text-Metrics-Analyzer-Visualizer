PREFACE
The classic edition of Algebra and Trigonometry with Analytic Geometry is a
special version of the twelfth edition of the same title.  It has been written for
professors seeking to teach a traditional course which requires only a scientific
calculator.  Both editions improve upon the eleventh edition in several ways.
This edition includes over 120 new or revised examples and exercises,
many of these resulting from suggestions of users and reviewers of the
eleventh edition. All have been incorporated without sacrificing the mathe-
matical soundness that has been paramount to the success of this text.    
Below is a brief overview of the chapters, followed by a short description
of the College Algebra course that I teach at Anoka Ramsey Community Col-
lege, and then a list of the general features of the text.
Overview
This chapter contains a summary of some basic algebra topics. Students
should be familiar with much of this material, but also challenged by some of
the exercises that prepare them for calculus.  
Equations and inequalities are solved algebraically in this chapter. Students
will extend their knowledge of these topics; for example, they have worked
with the quadratic formula, but will be asked to relate it to factoring and work
with coefficients that are not real numbers (see Examples 10 and 11 in Sec-
tion 2.3). 
Two-dimensional graphs and functions are introduced in this chapter. See the
updated Example 10 in Section 3.5 for a topical application (taxes) that relates
tables, formulas, and graphs.
This chapter begins with a discussion of polynomial functions and some poly-
nomial theory. A thorough treatment of rational functions is given in Section
4.5. This is followed by a section on variation, which includes graphs of sim-
ple polynomial and rational functions.

Chapter 1
Chapter 2
Chapter 3
Chapter 4
Inverse functions are the first topic of discussion (see new Example 4 in Sec-
tion 5.1 for a relationship to rational functions), followed by several sections
that deal with exponential and logarithmic functions. Modeling an exponential
function is given additional attention in this chapter (see Example 8 in Section
5.2) as well as in Chapter 9.
Angles are the first topic in this chapter. Next, the trigonometric functions are
introduced using a right triangle approach and then defined in terms of a unit
circle. Basic trigonometric identities appear throughout the chapter. The chap-
ter concludes with sections on trigonometric graphs and applied problems.
This chapter consists mostly of trigonometric identities, formulas, and equa-
tions. The last section contains definitions, properties, and applications of the
inverse trigonometric functions.
The law of sines and the law of cosines are used to solve oblique triangles.
Vectors are then introduced and used in applications. The last two sections re-
late the trigonometric functions and complex numbers.
Systems of inequalities and linear programming immediately follow solving
systems by substitution and elimination. Next, matrices are introduced and
used to solve systems. This chapter concludes with a discussion of determi-
nants and partial fractions.
This chapter begins with a discussion of sequences. Mathematical induction
and the binomial theorem are next, followed by counting topics (see Example
3 in Section 10.7 for an example involving both combinations and permuta-
tions). The last section is about probability and includes topics such as odds
and expected value.
Sections on the parabola, ellipse, and hyperbola begin this chapter. Two dif-
ferent ways of representing functions are given in the next sections on para-
metric equations and polar coordinates.
My Course
At Anoka Ramsey Community College in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, College
Algebra I is a one-semester 3-credit course. For students intending to take Cal-
culus, this course is followed by a one-semester 4-credit course, College Al-
gebra II and Trigonometry. This course also serves as a terminal math course
for many students.  
The sections covered in College Algebra I are
3.1–3.7, 4.1, 4.5 (part), 4.6, 5.1–5.6, 9.1–9.4, 10.1–10.3, and 10.5–10.8.

Chapters 1 and 2 are used as review material in some classes, and the remain-
ing sections are taught in the following course. A graphing calculator is re-
quired in some sections and optional in others.
Features
Illustrations
Brief demonstrations of the use of definitions, laws, and theo-
rems are provided in the form of illustrations.  
Charts
Charts give students easy access to summaries of properties, laws,
graphs, relationships, and definitions. These charts often contain simple illus-
trations of the concepts that are being introduced.
Examples
Titled for easy reference, all examples provide detailed solutions of
problems similar to those that appear in exercise sets. Many examples include
graphs, charts, or tables to help the student understand procedures and solutions. 
Step-by-Step Explanations
In order to help students follow them more easily,
many of the solutions in examples contain step-by-step explanations.  
Discussion Exercises
Each chapter ends with several exercises that are suit-
able for small-group discussions. These exercises range from easy to difficult
and from theoretical to application-oriented.
Checks
The solutions to some examples are explicitly checked, to remind
students to verify that their solutions satisfy the conditions of the problems.
Applications
To arouse student interest and to help students relate the exer-
cises to current real-life situations, applied exercises have been titled. One
look at the Index of Applications in the back of the book reveals the wide array
of topics. Many professors have indicated that the applications constitute one
of the strongest features of the text.  
Exercises
Exercise sets begin with routine drill problems and gradually
progress to more difficult problems. An ample number of exercises contain
graphs and tabular data; others require the student to find a mathematical
model for the given data. Many of the new exercises require the student to un-
derstand the conceptual relationship of an equation and its graph.
Applied problems generally appear near the end of an exercise set, to
allow students to gain confidence in working with the new ideas that have been
presented before they attempt problems that require greater analysis and syn-
thesis of these ideas.  Review exercises at the end of each chapter may be used
to prepare for examinations.

P R E F A C E
Guidelines
Boxed guidelines enumerate the steps in a procedure or technique
to help students solve problems in a systematic fashion.
Warnings
Interspersed throughout the text are warnings to alert students to
common mistakes.  
Text Art Forming a total art package that is second to none, figures and graphs
have been computer-generated for accuracy, using the latest technology. Colors
are employed to distinguish between different parts of figures. For example, the
graph of one function may be shown in blue and that of a second function in
red. Labels are the same color as the parts of the figure they identify.
Text Design The text has been designed to ensure that discussions are easy to
follow and important concepts are highlighted. Color is used pedagogically to
clarify complex graphs and to help students visualize applied problems. Pre-
vious adopters of the text have confirmed that the text strikes a very appealing
balance in terms of color use.
Endpapers
The endpapers in the front and back of the text provide useful
summaries from algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.
Appendixes
Appendix I, “Common Graphs and Their Equations,” is a picto-
rial summary of graphs and equations that students commonly encounter in
precalculus mathematics. Appendix II, “A Summary of Graph Transforma-
tions,” is an illustrative synopsis of the basic graph transformations discussed
in the text: shifting, stretching, compressing, and reflecting. Appendix III,
“Graphs of Trigonometric Functions and Their Inverses,” contains graphs,
domains, and ranges of the six trigonometric functions and their inverses. 
Appendix IV, “Values of the Trigonometric Functions of Special Angles on a
Unit Circle,” is a full-page reference for the most common angles on a unit 
circle—valuable for students who are trying to learn the basic trigonometric
functions values.
Answer Section The answer section at the end of the text provides answers for
most of the odd-numbered exercises, as well as answers for all chapter review
exercises. Considerable thought and effort were devoted to making this section
a learning device for the student instead of merely a place to check answers.
For instance, proofs are given for mathematical induction problems. Numeri-
cal answers for many exercises are stated in both an exact and an approximate
form. Graphs, proofs, and hints are included whenever appropriate. Author-
prepared solutions and answers ensure a high degree of consistency among the
text, the solutions manuals, and the answers.

The word algebra comes from ilm al-jabr w’al muqabala, the title of a book
written in the ninth century by the Arabian mathematician al-Khworizimi.
The title has been translated as the science of restoration and reduction,
which means transposing and combining similar terms (of an equation).
The Latin transliteration of al-jabr led to the name of the branch of mathe-
matics we now call algebra.
In algebra we use symbols or letters—such as a, b, c, d, x, y—to de-
note arbitrary numbers. This general nature of algebra is illustrated by the
many formulas used in science and industry. As you proceed through this
text and go on either to more advanced courses in mathematics or to fields
that employ mathematics, you will become more and more aware of the im-
portance and the power of algebraic techniques.

Concepts of Algebra
Real numbers are used throughout mathematics, and you should be acquainted
with symbols that represent them, such as
1,
73,
5,
,
0,
,
and so on. The positive integers, or natural numbers, are
The whole numbers (or nonnegative integers) are the natural numbers com-
bined with the number 0. The integers are often listed as follows:
Throughout this text lowercase letters a, b, c, x, y,… represent arbitrary
real numbers (also called variables). If a and b denote the same real number,
we write 
, which is read “a is equal to b” and is called an equality. The
notation 
is read “a is not equal to b.”
If a, b, and c are integers and 
, then a and b are factors, or divi-
sors, of c. For example, since
we know that 1,
, 2,
, 3,
, 6, and  
are factors of 6.
A positive integer p different from 1 is prime if its only positive factors
are 1 and p. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. The Fun-
damental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer different
from 1 can be expressed as a product of primes in one and only one way (ex-
cept for order of factors). Some examples are
A rational number is a real number that can be expressed in the form 
, where a and b are integers and 
. Note that every integer a is a ra-
tional number, since it can be expressed in the form 
. Every real number
can be expressed as a decimal, and the decimal representations for rational
numbers are either terminating or nonterminating and repeating. For example,
we can show by using the arithmetic process of division that
where the digits 1 and 8 in the representation of 
repeat indefinitely (some-
times written 
).

Real Numbers
Real numbers that are not rational are irrational numbers. Decimal rep-
resentations for irrational numbers are always nonterminating and nonrepeat-
ing. One common irrational number, denoted by 
, is the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter. We sometimes use the notation
to indicate that 
is approximately equal to 3.1416.
There is no rational number b such that 
, where 
denotes 
.
However, there is an irrational number, denoted by 
(the square root of 2),
such that  
.
The system of real numbers consists of all rational and irrational num-
bers. Relationships among the types of numbers used in algebra are illustrated
in the diagram in Figure 1, where a line connecting two rectangles means that
the numbers named in the higher rectangle include those in the lower rectan-
gle. The complex numbers, discussed in Section 2.4, contain all real numbers.
Figure 1
Types of numbers used in algebra
The real numbers are closed relative to the operation of addition (de-
noted by 
); that is, to every pair a, b of real numbers there corresponds ex-
actly one real number 
called the sum of a and b. The real numbers are
also closed relative to multiplication (denoted by ); that is, to every pair a,
b of real numbers there corresponds exactly one real number 
(also de-
noted by ab) called the product of a and b.
Important properties of addition and multiplication of real numbers are

Since 
and 
are always equal, we may use
to denote this real number. We use abc for either 
or 
.
Similarly, if four or more real numbers a, b, c, d are added or multiplied, we
may write 
for their sum and abcd for their product, regardless
of how the numbers are grouped or interchanged.
The distributive properties are useful for finding products of many types
of expressions involving sums. The next example provides one illustration.

Properties of Real Numbers
The following are basic properties of equality.
Properties 1 and 2 state that the same number may be added to both sides
of an equality, and both sides of an equality may be multiplied by the same
number. We will use these properties extensively throughout the text to help
find solutions of equations.
The next result can be proved.
When we use the word or as we do in (2), we mean that at least one of the fac-
tors a and b is 0. We will refer to (2) as the zero factor theorem in future work.

Subtraction and Division
To divide one
number by a
nonzero number,
multiply by the
reciprocal.
Real numbers may be represented by points on a line l such that to each
real number a there corresponds exactly one point on l and to each point P on
l there corresponds one real number. This is called a one-to-one correspon-
dence. We first choose an arbitrary point O, called the origin, and associate
with it the real number 0. Points associated with the integers are then deter-
mined by laying off successive line segments of equal length on either side of
O, as illustrated in Figure 2. The point corresponding to a rational number,
such as , is obtained by subdividing these line segments. Points associated
with certain irrational numbers, such as 
, can be found by construction (see
Exercise 45).
Figure 2
The number a that is associated with a point A on l is the coordinate of
A. We refer to these coordinates as a coordinate system and call l a coordi-
nate line or a real line. A direction can be assigned to l by taking the positive
direction to the right and the negative direction to the left. The positive di-
rection is noted by placing an arrowhead on l, as shown in Figure 2.

Properties of Quotients
The numbers that correspond to points to the right of O in Figure 2 are
positive real numbers. Numbers that correspond to points to the left of O are
negative real numbers. The real number 0 is neither positive nor negative.
Note the difference between a negative real number and the negative of a
real number. In particular, the negative of a real number a can be positive. For
example, if a is negative, say 
, then the negative of a is
, which is positive. In general, we have the following relationships.
In the following chart we define the notions of greater than and less than
for real numbers a and b. The symbols 
and 
are inequality signs, and the
expressions 
and 
are called (strict) inequalities.
If points A and B on a coordinate line have coordinates a and b, respec-
tively, then 
is equivalent to the statement “A is to the right of B,”
whereas 
is equivalent to “A is to the left of B.”

We refer to the sign of a real number as positive if the number is positive,
or negative if the number is negative. Two real numbers have the same sign if
both are positive or both are negative. The numbers have opposite signs if one
is positive and the other is negative. The following results about the signs of
products and quotients of two real numbers a and b can be proved using prop-
erties of negatives and quotients.
The converses* of the laws of signs are also true. For example, if a quo-
tient is negative, then the numerator and denominator have opposite signs.
The notation

*If a theorem is written in the form “if P, then Q,” where P and Q are mathematical statements
called the hypothesis and conclusion, respectively, then the converse of the theorem has the form
“if Q, then P.” If both the theorem and its converse are true, we often write “P if and only if Q”
(denoted P iff Q).
If a is an integer, then it is the coordinate of some point A on a coordinate
line, and the symbol

We shall use the concept of absolute value to define the distance between
any two points on a coordinate line. First note that the distance between the
points with coordinates 2 and 7, shown in Figure 4, equals 5 units. This dis-
tance is the difference obtained by subtracting the smaller (leftmost) coordi-
nate from the larger (rightmost) coordinate 
. If we use absolute
values, then, since 
, it is unnecessary to be concerned about
the order of subtraction. This fact motivates the next definition.

Finding distances between points
Let A, B, C, and D have coordinates 
,

ordinate line, as shown in Figure 5. Find

Using the definition of the distance between points on a coor-
dinate line, we obtain the distances:
L
The concept of absolute value has uses other than finding distances be-
tween points; it is employed whenever we are interested in the magnitude or
numerical value of a real number without regard to its sign.
In the next section we shall discuss the exponential notation
, where a
is a real number (called the base) and n is an integer (called an exponent). In
particular, for base 10 we have

positive exponent, as follows:

We can use this notation to write any finite decimal representation of a
real number as a sum of the following type:
In the sciences it is often necessary to work with very large or very small
numbers and to compare the relative magnitudes of very large or very small
quantities. We usually represent a large or small positive number a in scientific
form, using the symbol 
to denote multiplication.
The distance a ray of light travels in one year is approximately
5,900,000,000,000 miles. This number may be written in scientific form as
. The positive exponent 12 indicates that the decimal point should
be moved 12 places to the right. The notation works equally well for small
numbers. The weight of an oxygen molecule is estimated to be
gram,
or, in scientific form,
gram. The negative exponent indicates that
the decimal point should be moved 23 places to the left.
Scientific Form
Many calculators use scientific form in their display panels. For the num-
ber 
, the 10 is suppressed and the exponent is often shown preceded by
the letter E. For example, to find 
on a scientific calculator, we
could enter the integer 4,500,000 and press the 
(or squaring) key, obtain-
ing a display similar to one of those in Figure 6. We would translate this as
. Thus,
Calculators may also use scientific form in the entry of numbers. The user’s
manual for your calculator should give specific details.
Before we conclude this section, we should briefly consider the issue of
rounding off results. Applied problems often include numbers that are ob-

tained by various types of measurements and, hence, are approximations to
exact values. Such answers should be rounded off, since the final result of a
calculation cannot be more accurate than the data that have been used. For ex-
ample, if the length and width of a rectangle are measured to two-decimal-
place accuracy, we cannot expect more than two-decimal-place accuracy in the
calculated value of the area of the rectangle. For purely mathematical work, if
values of the length and width of a rectangle are given, we assume that the di-
mensions are exact, and no rounding off is required.
If a number a is written in scientific form as 
for 
and if c is rounded off to k decimal places, then we say that a is accurate (or
has been rounded off) to 
significant figures, or digits. For example,
37.2638 rounded to 5 significant figures is 
, or 37.264; to 3
significant figures,
, or 37.3; and to 1 significant figure,

or 40.

called the exponent, and the real number a is called the base.
The next illustration contains several numerical examples of exponential

If m and n are positive integers, then
m factors of a
n factors of a
Since the total number of factors of a on the right is 
, this expression is
equal to 
; that is,
We can extend this formula to
or
by using the definitions of the zero
exponent and negative exponents. This gives us law 1, stated in the next chart.
To prove law 2, we may write, for m and n positive,
n factors of 
and count the number of times a appears as a factor on the right-hand side.
Since 
, with a occurring as a factor m times, and
since the number of such groups of m factors is n, the total number of factors
of a is 
. Thus,
The cases 
and 
can be proved using the definition of nonpositive
exponents. The remaining three laws can be established in similar fashion by
counting factors. In laws 4 and 5 we assume that denominators are not 0.
We usually use 5(a) if 
and 5(b) if 
.
We can extend laws of exponents to obtain rules such as 
and 
. Some other examples of the laws of exponents are given

To simplify an expression involving powers of real numbers means to
change it to an expression in which each real number appears only once and

The three laws listed in the next chart are true for positive integers m
and n, provided the indicated roots exist—that is, provided the roots are
real numbers.
The radicands in laws 1 and 2 involve products and quotients. Care must
be taken if sums or differences occur in the radicand. The following chart con-
tains two particular warnings concerning commonly made mistakes.
If c is a real number and 
occurs as a factor in a radical of index n, then
we can remove c from the radicand if the sign of c is taken into account. For
example, if 
or if 
and n is odd, then
provided

and n is even, then
provided

and so on—that appear in radicands represent positive real numbers, unless
otherwise specified.
As shown in the preceding illustration and in the following examples, if
the index of a radical is n, then we rearrange the radicand, isolating a factor of
the form 
, where p may consist of several letters. We then remove 
from the radical, as previously indicated. Thus, in Example 3(b) the index of
the radical is 3 and we rearrange the radicand into cubes, obtaining a factor 
, with 
. In part (c) the index of the radical is 2 and we rearrange
the radicand into squares, obtaining a factor 
, with

To simplify a radical means to remove factors from the radical until no
factor in the radicand has an exponent greater than or equal to the index of the
radical and the index is as low as possible.

If we use a calculator to find decimal approximations of radicals, there is
no advantage in rationalizing denominators, such as 
or
, as we did in Example 4(a) and (c). However, for algebraic
simplifications, changing expressions to such forms is sometimes desirable.
Similarly, in advanced mathematics courses such as calculus, changing 
to 
, as in Example 4(b), could make a problem more complicated. In
such courses it is simpler to work with the expression 
than with its ra-
tionalized form.
We next use radicals to define rational exponents.

The Exponential Notation 
The laws of exponents are true for rational exponents and also for irra-
tional exponents, such as 
or 
, considered in Chapter 5.
To simplify an expression involving rational powers of letters that repre-
sent real numbers, we change it to an expression in which each letter appears
only once and all exponents are positive. As we did with radicals, we shall as-
sume that all letters represent positive real numbers unless otherwise specified.

We sometimes use the notation and terminology of sets to describe mathemati-
cal relationships. A set is a collection of objects of some type, and the objects
are called elements of the set. Capital letters R, S, T, . . . are often used to de-
note sets, and lowercase letters a, b, x, y, . . . usually represent elements of sets.
Throughout this book,
denotes the set of real numbers and 
denotes the set
of integers.
Two sets S and T are equal, denoted by 
, if S and T contain exactly
the same elements. We write 
if S and T are not equal. Additional nota-
tion and terminology are listed in the following chart.

Algebraic Expressions
We usually use letters near the end of the alphabet, such as x, y, and z, for
variables and letters near the beginning of the alphabet, such as a, b, and c, for
constants. Throughout this text, unless otherwise specified, variables represent
real numbers.
If the elements of a set S have a certain property, we sometimes write
and state the property describing the variable x in the space after the
colon. The expression involving the braces and colon is read “the set of all x
such that . . . ,” where we complete the phrase by stating the desired property.
For example,
is read “the set of all x such that x is greater than 3.”
For finite sets, we sometimes list all the elements of the set within braces.
Thus, if the set T consists of the first five positive integers, we may write
. When we describe sets in this way, the order used in listing
the elements is irrelevant, so we could also write 
,
, and so on.
If we begin with any collection of variables and real numbers, then an al-
gebraic expression is the result obtained by applying additions, subtractions,
multiplications, divisions, powers, or the taking of roots to this collection. If
specific numbers are substituted for the variables in an algebraic expression,
the resulting number is called the value of the expression for these numbers.
The domain of an algebraic expression consists of all real numbers that may
represent the variables. Thus, unless otherwise specified, we assume that the
domain consists of the real numbers that, when substituted for the variables,
do not make the expression meaningless, in the sense that denominators can-
not equal zero and roots always exist. Two illustrations are given in the fol-
lowing chart.
If x is a variable, then a monomial in x is an expression of the form 
,
where a is a real number and n is a nonnegative integer. A binomial is a sum
of two monomials, and a trinomial is a sum of three monomials. A polyno-
mial in x is a sum of any number of monomials in x. Another way of stating
this is as follows.

Each expression 
in the sum is a term of the polynomial. If a coeffi-
cient 
is zero, we usually delete the term 
. The coefficient 
of the high-
est power of x is called the leading coefficient of the polynomial.
The following chart contains specific illustrations of polynomials.
By definition, two polynomials are equal if and only if they have the same
degree and the coefficients of like powers of x are equal. If all the coefficients
of a polynomial are zero, it is called the zero polynomial and is denoted by 0.
However, by convention, the degree of the zero polynomial is not zero but, in-
stead, is undefined. If c is a nonzero real number, then c is a polynomial of de-
gree 0. Such polynomials (together with the zero polynomial) are constant
polynomials.
If a coefficient of a polynomial is negative, we usually use a minus sign
between appropriate terms. To illustrate,
We may also consider polynomials in variables other than x. For example,
is a polynomial in z of degree 7. We often arrange
the terms of a polynomial in order of decreasing powers of the variable; thus,
we write
We may regard a polynomial in x as an algebraic expression obtained by
employing a finite number of additions, subtractions, and multiplications in-
volving x. If an algebraic expression contains divisions or roots involving a
variable x, then it is not a polynomial in x.

Nonpolynomials
Since polynomials represent real numbers, we may use the properties de-
scribed in Section 1.1. In particular, if additions, subtractions, and multiplica-
tions are carried out with polynomials, we may simplify the results by using
properties of real numbers, as demonstrated in the following examples.

SOLUT ION
Method 1
We begin by using a distributive property, treating the polynomial
as a single real number:
We next use another distributive property three times and simplify the result,
obtaining
Note that the three monomials in the first polynomial were multiplied by
each of the three monomials in the second polynomial, giving us a total of
nine terms.
Method 2
We list the polynomials vertically and multiply, leaving spaces for
powers of x that have zero coefficients, as follows:
In practice, we would omit the reasons (equalities) listed on the right in the last
four lines.

We may consider polynomials in more than one variable. For example, a
polynomial in two variables, x and y, is a finite sum of terms, each of the form
for some real number a and nonnegative integers m and k. An example is

Other polynomials may involve three variables—such as x, y, z—or, for that
matter, any number of variables. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication
are performed using properties of real numbers, just as for polynomials in
one variable.

The products listed in the next chart occur so frequently that they deserve
special attention. You can check the validity of each formula by multiplication.
In (2) and (3), we use either the top sign on both sides or the bottom sign on
both sides. Thus, (2) is actually two formulas:
Similarly, (3) represents two formulas.

If a polynomial is a product of other polynomials, then each polynomial
in the product is a factor of the original polynomial. Factoring is the process
of expressing a sum of terms as a product. For example, since 
, the polynomials 
and 
are factors of 
.
Factoring is an important process in mathematics, since it may be used to
reduce the study of a complicated expression to the study of several simpler
expressions. For example, properties of the polynomial 
can be deter-
mined by examining the factors
and
. As we shall see in Chapter 2,
another important use for factoring is in finding solutions of equations.
We shall be interested primarily in nontrivial factors of polynomials—
that is, factors that contain polynomials of positive degree. However, if the co-
efficients are restricted to integers, then we usually remove a common integral
factor from each term of the polynomial. For example,
A polynomial with coefficients in some set S of numbers is prime, or ir-
reducible over S, if it cannot be written as a product of two polynomials of
positive degree with coefficients in S. A polynomial may be irreducible over
one set S but not over another. For example,
is irreducible over the ra-
tional numbers, since it cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials
of positive degree that have rational coefficients. However,
is not irre-
ducible over the real numbers, since we can write

Similarly,
is irreducible over the real numbers, but, as we shall see in
Section 2.4, not over the complex numbers.
Every polynomial 
of degree 1 is irreducible.
Before we factor a polynomial, we must specify the number system (or
set) from which the coefficients of the factors are to be chosen. In this chapter
we shall use the rule that if a polynomial has integral coefficients, then the fac-
tors should be polynomials with integral coefficients. To factor a polynomial
means to express it as a product of irreducible polynomials.
The greatest common factor (gcf) of an expression is the product of the
factors that appear in each term, with each of these factors raised to the small-
est nonzero exponent appearing in any term. In factoring polynomials, it is ad-
visable to first factor out the gcf, as shown in the following illustration.
Factored Polynomials
It is usually difficult to factor polynomials of degree greater than 2. In
simple cases, the following factoring formulas may be useful. Each formula
can be verified by multiplying the factors on the right-hand side of the equals
sign. It can be shown that the factors 
and 
in the
difference and sum of two cubes, respectively, are irreducible over the real
numbers.
Several other illustrations of the use of factoring formulas are given in the
next two examples.

A factorization of a trinomial 
, where p, q, and r are inte-
gers, must be of the form
where a, b, c, and d are integers. It follows that
Only a limited number of choices for a, b, c, and d satisfy these conditions.
If none of the choices work, then 
is irreducible. Trying the var-
ious possibilities, as depicted in the next example, is called the method
of trial and error. This method is also applicable to trinomials of the form

The method of trial and error illustrated in Example 8 can be long and te-
dious if the coefficients of the polynomial are large and have many prime fac-
tors. We will show a factoring method in Section 2.3 that can be used to factor
any trinomial of the form of the one in Example 8—regardless of the size of
the coefficients. For simple cases, it is often possible to arrive at the correct
choice rapidly.

as circulation, regulation of body temperature, and respi-

height h (in centimeters), and age y (in years), we can es-

following formulas, where

essary for females and males, respectively:
(a) Determine the basal energy requirements first for 
a 25-year-old female weighing 59 kilograms who is
163 centimeters tall and then for a 55-year-old male
weighing 75 kilograms who is 178 centimeters tall.
(b) Discuss why, in both formulas, the coefficient for y is
negative but the other coefficients are positive.

In most of our work we will be concerned with rational expressions in
which both numerator and denominator are polynomials in only one variable.
Since the variables in a rational expression represent real numbers, we
may use the properties of quotients in Section 1.1, replacing the letters a, b, c,
and d with polynomials. The following property is of particular importance,
where 
:
We sometimes describe this simplification process by saying that a common
nonzero factor in the numerator and denominator of a quotient may be can-
celed. In practice, we usually show this cancellation by means of a slash
through the common factor, as in the following illustration, where all denom-
inators are assumed to be nonzero.
Canceled Common Factors
A rational expression is simplified, or reduced to lowest terms, if the nu-
merator and denominator have no common polynomial factors of positive de-
gree and no common integral factors greater than 1. To simplify a rational
expression, we factor both the numerator and the denominator into prime fac-
tors and then, assuming the factors in the denominator are not zero, cancel
common factors, as in the following illustration.
Simplified Rational Expressions
As shown in the next example, when simplifying a product or quotient of
rational expressions, we often use properties of quotients to obtain one rational
expression. Then we factor the numerator and denominator and cancel com-
mon factors, as we did in the preceding illustration.

To add or subtract two rational expressions, we usually find a common de-
nominator and use the following properties of quotients:
If the denominators of the expressions are not the same, we may obtain a com-
mon denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator of each frac-
tion by a suitable expression. We usually use the least common denominator
(lcd) of the two quotients. To find the lcd, we factor each denominator into
primes and then form the product of the different prime factors, using the
largest exponent that appears with each prime factor. Let us begin with a nu-
merical example of this technique.

Methods for solving equations date back to the Babylonians (2000 B.C.),
who described equations in words instead of the variables—x, y, and so
on—that we use today. Major advances in finding solutions of equations
then took place in Italy in the sixteenth century and continued throughout
the world well into the nineteenth century. In modern times, computers are
used to approximate solutions of very complicated equations.
Inequalities that involve variables have now attained the same level of
importance as equations, and they are used extensively in applications of
mathematics. In this chapter we shall discuss several methods for solving
basic equations and inequalities.

Equations and
Inequalities
An equation (or equality) is a statement that two quantities or expressions are
equal. Equations are employed in every field that uses real numbers. As an il-
lustration, the equation
or
is used in solving problems involving an object moving at a constant rate of
speed. If the rate r is 
(miles per hour), then the distance d (in miles)
traveled after time t (in hours) is given by
For example, if 
, then 
. If we wish to find how
long it takes the object to travel 75 miles, we let 
and solve the
equation
or, equivalently,
Dividing both sides of the last equation by 45, we obtain
Thus, if 
, then the time required to travel 75 miles is 
hours, or
1 hour and 40 minutes.
Note that the equation 
contains three variables: d, r, and t. In much
of our work in this chapter we shall consider equations that contain only one
variable. The following chart applies to a variable x, but any other variable
may be considered. The abbreviations LS and RS in the second illustration
stand for the equation’s left side and right side, respectively.

An algebraic equation in x contains only algebraic expressions such as
polynomials, rational expressions, radicals, and so on. An equation of this type
is called a conditional equation if there are numbers in the domains of the ex-
pressions that are not solutions. For example, the equation 
is condi-
tional, since the number 
(and others) is not a solution. If every number
in the domains of the expressions in an algebraic equation is a solution, the
equation is called an identity.
Sometimes it is difficult to determine whether an equation is conditional
or an identity. An identity will often be indicated when, after properties of real
numbers are applied, an equation of the form 
is obtained, where p is
some expression. To illustrate, if we multiply both sides of the equation
by 
, we obtain 
. This alerts us to the fact that we may have an
identity on our hands; it does not, however, prove anything. A standard method
for verifying that an equation is an identity is to show, using properties of real
numbers, that the expression which appears on one side of the given equation
can be transformed into the expression which appears on the other side of the
given equation. That is easy to do in the preceding illustration, since we know
that 
. Of course, to show that an equation is not an
identity, we need only find one real number in the domain of the variable that
fails to satisfy the original equation.
The most basic equation in algebra is the linear equation, defined in the
next chart, where a and b denote real numbers.
The illustration in the preceding chart indicates a typical method of solv-
ing a linear equation. Following the same procedure, we see that
if
,
then
provided 
. Thus, a linear equation has exactly one solution.
We sometimes solve an equation by making a list of equivalent equations,
each in some sense simpler than the preceding one, ending the list with an
equation from which the solutions can be easily obtained. We often simplify
an equation by adding the same expression to both sides or subtracting the
same expression from both sides. We can also multiply or divide both sides of
an equation by an expression that represents a nonzero real number. In the fol-
lowing examples, the phrases in color indicate how an equivalent equation was
obtained from the preceding equation. To shorten these phrases we have, as in
Example 1, used “add 7” instead of the more accurate but lengthy add 7 to
both sides. Similarly, “subtract 
” is used for subtract 
from both sides, and
“divide by 4” means divide both sides by 4.

Guidelines for Solving 
an Equation Containing 
Rational Expressions
1 Determine the lcd of the rational expressions.
2 Find the values of the variable that make the lcd zero. These are not
solutions, because they yield at least one zero denominator when sub-
stituted into the given equation.
3 Multiply each term of the equation by the lcd and simplify, thereby elim-
inating all of the denominators.
4 Solve the equation obtained in guideline 3.
5 The solutions of the given equation are the solutions found in guide-
line 4, with the exclusion of the values found in guideline 2.

Guideline 2
The values of x that make the lcd

Since

the lcd zero (guideline 2), we see that

equation.
We shall not check the solution 
by substitution, because the arith-
metic involved is complicated. It is simpler to carefully check the algebraic
manipulations used in each step. However, a calculator check is recommended.L
Formulas involving several variables occur in many applications of math-
ematics. Sometimes it is necessary to solve for a specific variable in terms of
the remaining variables that appear in the formula, as the next two examples
illustrate.

Equations are often used to solve applied problems—that is, problems that in-
volve applications of mathematics to other fields. Because of the unlimited va-
riety of applied problems, it is difficult to state specific rules for finding
solutions. The following guidelines may be helpful, provided the problem can
be formulated in terms of an equation in one variable.

Guidelines for Solving 
Applied Problems
1 If the problem is stated in writing, read it carefully several times and
think about the given facts, together with the unknown quantity that is 
to be found.
2 Introduce a letter to denote the unknown quantity. This is one of the most
crucial steps in the solution. Phrases containing words such as what, find,
how much, how far, or when should alert you to the unknown quantity.
3 If appropriate, draw a picture and label it.
4 List the known facts, together with any relationships that involve the un-
known quantity. A relationship may be described by an equation in
which written statements, instead of letters or numbers, appear on one or
both sides of the equals sign.
5 After analyzing the list in guideline 4, formulate an equation that de-
scribes precisely what is stated in words.
6 Solve the equation formulated in guideline 5.
7 Check the solutions obtained in guideline 6 by referring to the original
statement of the problem. Verify that the solution agrees with the stated
conditions.

SOLUT ION
Since the unknown quantity is the presale price, we let
We next note the following facts:
The sale price is determined as follows:
Translating the last equation into symbols and then solving gives us

Investing money in two stocks
An investment firm has $100,000 to invest for a client and decides to invest it
in two stocks, A and B. The expected annual rate of return, or simple interest,
for stock A is 15%, but there is some risk involved, and the client does not wish
to invest more than $50,000 in this stock. The annual rate of return on the more
stable stock B is anticipated to be 10%. Determine whether there is a way of
investing the money so that the annual interest is
(a) $12,000
(b) $13,000
SOLUT ION
The annual interest is given by

simple interest formula 
with

vested in stock A, then

Thus, $40,000 should be invested in stock A, and the remaining $60,000

than $50,000, this manner of investing the money meets the requirement of 
the client.

The total annual interest is $13,000 if

Thus, $60,000 should be invested in stock A and the remaining $40,000 in
stock B. This plan does not meet the client’s requirement that no more than
$50,000 be invested in stock A. Hence, the firm cannot invest the client’s
money in stocks A and B such that the total annual interest is $13,000.

We now solve for x:

divide by 0.5
Hence, 4 milliliters of pure acid should be added to the original solution.

If 4 milliliters of acid is added to the original solution, then the new

Replacing antifreeze

Since the number of quarts of pure antifreeze in the final mixture can be

We now solve for x:
multiply factors
combine x terms and subtract 3.2
divide by 0.6
Thus,
quarts should be drained from the original mixture.
C h e c k
Let us first note that the amount of antifreeze in the original 8-quart
mixture was 
, or 3.2 quarts. In draining quarts of the original 40% mix-
ture, we lose 
quarts of antifreeze, and so 
quarts of an-
tifreeze remain after draining. If we then add quarts of pure antifreeze, the
amount of antifreeze in the final mixture is
This number, 4.8, is 60% of 8.

Comparing times traveled by cars
Two cities are connected by means of a highway. A car leaves city B at

ond car reach the first car?
SOLUT ION
Let t denote the number of hours after 1:00 P.M. traveled by the
first car. Since the second car leaves B at 1:30 P.M., it has traveled hour less

and the elbow.) For a female, if x is the length of the
humerus (in centimeters), then her height h (in centimeters)
can be determined using the formula 
. For a
male,

Quadratic Equations
A toy rocket is launched vertically upward from level ground, as illustrated

gravity, then the rocket’s height h (in feet) above the ground after t seconds
is given by
Some values of h for the first 7 seconds of flight are listed in the following

the ground at some time between

was 180 feet above the ground at some time between 
and

the exact values of t for which

As indicated in the next chart, an equation of this type is called a quadratic
equation in t. After developing a formula for solving such equations, we will
return to this problem in Example 13 and find the exact times at which the
rocket was 180 feet above the ground.
To enable us to solve many types of equations, we will make use of the
next theorem.
The zero factor theorem can be extended to any number of algebraic ex-
pressions—that is,

Constructing a rectangular box
A box with a square base and no top is to be made from a square piece of tin
by cutting out a 3-inch square from each corner and folding up the sides. If the
box is to hold 48
, what size piece of tin should be used?
SOLUT ION
We begin by drawing the picture in Figure 2, letting x denote
the unknown length of the side of the piece of tin. Subsequently, each side of
the base of the box will have length 
.
Since the area of the base of the box is 
and the height is 3, we 
obtain
Since the box is to hold 48

Referring to Figure 2, we see that 
is unacceptable, since
no box is possible in this case. However, if we begin with a 10-inch square of
tin, cut out 3-inch corners, and fold, we obtain a box having dimensions
4 inches, 4 inches, and 3 inches. The box has the desired volume of 48
.
Thus, a 10-inch square is the answer to the problem.

As illustrated in Example 12, even though an equation is formulated cor-

nature of a given problem. Such solutions should be discarded. For example,
we would not accept the answer 7 years for the age of an individual or 
for the number of automobiles in a parking lot.

The solutions of the first three equations in the chart are in ; however,

tions of

tem
, which contains both 
and numbers whose squares are negative.
We begin by introducing the imaginary unit, denoted by i, which has the
following properties.
Because its square is negative, the letter i does not represent a real number. It
is a new mathematical entity that will enable us to obtain . Since i, together
with , is to be contained in , we must consider products of the form bi for
a real number b and also expressions of the form 
for real numbers a and
b. The next chart provides definitions we shall use.
Note that the pure imaginary numbers are a subset of the imaginary num-
bers and the imaginary numbers are a subset of the complex numbers. We use
the phrase nonreal complex number interchangeably with imaginary number.
It is not necessary to memorize the definitions of addition and multiplica-
tion of complex numbers given in the preceding chart. Instead, we may treat
all symbols as having properties of real numbers, with exactly one exception:
We replace 
by 
. Thus, for the product 
we simply use the

Hence, we may regard

(that is,

sum and the product of complex numbers.
Note that the sum and the product of a complex number and its conjugate are
real numbers. Conjugates are useful for finding the multiplicative inverse of

, or for simplifying the quotient of two complex numbers.
As illustrated in the next example, we may think of these types of simplifica-

quotient by the conjugate of the denominator divided by itself.

Hence,
If only one of a or b is negative, then

Other Types of Equations
The equations considered in previous sections are inadequate for many prob-
lems. For example, in applications it is often necessary to consider powers 
with 
. Some equations involve absolute values or radicals. In this section
we give examples of equations of these types that can be solved using ele-
mentary methods.

Solving for x gives us
Thus, the given equation has two solutions, 8 and 2.
L
For an equation such as
we first isolate the absolute value expression by subtracting 3 and dividing by
2 to obtain
and then we proceed as in Example 1.

If an equation is in factored form with zero on one side, then we may ob-
tain solutions by setting each factor equal to zero. For example, if p, q, and r
are expressions in x and if 
, then either 
,
, or

next example we factor by grouping terms.

In Example 3 it would have been incorrect to divide both sides of the
equation 
by 
, obtaining 
, since the solution 
would be
lost. In general, avoid dividing both sides of an equation by an expression that
contains variables—always factor instead.
If an equation involves radicals or fractional exponents, we often raise
both sides to a positive power. The solutions of the new equation always con-
tain the solutions of the given equation. For example, the solutions of
are also solutions of
In some cases the new equation has more solutions than the given equation. To
illustrate, if we are given the equation 
and we square both sides, we ob-
tain 
. Note that the given equation 
has only one solution, 3, but
the new equation 
has two solutions, 3 and 
. Any solution of the new
equation that is not a solution of the given equation is an extraneous solution.
Since extraneous solutions may occur, it is absolutely essential to check all so-
lutions obtained after raising both sides of an equation to an even power. Such
checks are unnecessary if both sides are raised to an odd power, because in this
case extraneous (real number) solutions are not introduced.

Determining the route of a ferry
A passenger ferry makes trips from a town to an island community that is
7 miles downshore from the town and 3 miles off a straight shoreline. As
shown in Figure 1, the ferry travels along the shoreline to some point and then
proceeds directly to the island. If the ferry travels 12 mi hr along the shoreline
and 10 mi hr as it moves out to sea, determine the routes that have a travel
time of 45 minutes.
SOLUT ION
Let x denote the distance traveled along the shoreline. This
leads to the sketch in Figure 2, where d is the distance from a point on the
shoreline to the island. Refer to the indicated right triangle:
Pythagorean theorem

Taking the square root of both sides and noting that 
, we obtain
Using distance
(rate)(time) or, equivalently, time
(distance) (rate) gives
us the following table.
The time for the complete trip is the sum of the two expressions in the last row
of the table. Since the rate is in mi hr, we must, for consistency, express this
time (45 minutes) as hour. Thus, we have the following:

of a nail indicates its holding strength in wood. A formula
that is used for bright common nails is 
,
where P is the maximum withdrawal resistance (in pounds),
S is the specific gravity of the wood at 12% moisture con-
tent, R is the radius of the nail (in inches), and D is the depth
(in inches) that the nail has penetrated the wood. A 6d (six-
penny) bright, common nail of length 2 inches and diame-

An inequality is a statement that two quantities or expressions are not equal.
It may be the case that one quantity is less than 
, less than or equal to 
, greater than 
, or greater than or equal to 
another quantity. Con-
sider the inequality
where x is a variable. As illustrated in the following table, certain numbers
yield true statements when substituted for x, and others yield false statements.
If a true statement is obtained when a number b is substituted for x, then
b is a solution of the inequality. Thus,

since 
is true, but 
is not a solution since 
is false. To
solve an inequality means to find all solutions. Two inequalities are equiva-
lent if they have exactly the same solutions.
Most inequalities have an infinite number of solutions. To illustrate, the
solutions of the inequality
consist of every real number x between 2 and 5. We call this set of numbers an
open interval and denote it by (2, 5). The graph of the open interval (2, 5) is
the set of all points on a coordinate line that lie between—but do not in-
clude—the points corresponding to 
and 
. The graph is repre-
sented by shading an appropriate part of the axis, as shown in Figure 1. We
refer to this process as sketching the graph of the interval. The numbers 2 and
5 are called the endpoints of the interval (2, 5). The parentheses in the nota-
tion (2, 5) and in Figure 1 are used to indicate that the endpoints of the inter-
val are not included.
If we wish to include an endpoint, we use a bracket instead of a paren-
thesis. For example, the solutions of the inequality 
are denoted by
[2, 5] and are referred to as a closed interval. The graph of [2, 5] is sketched
in Figure 2, where brackets indicate that endpoints are included. We shall also
consider half-open intervals
and 
and infinite intervals, as de-
scribed in the following chart. The symbol 
(read “infinity”) used for infinite
intervals is merely a notational device and does not represent a real number.

Methods for solving inequalities in x are similar to those used for solving
equations. In particular, we often use properties of inequalities to replace a
given inequality with a list of equivalent inequalities, ending with an inequal-
ity from which solutions are easily obtained. The properties in the following
chart can be proved for real numbers a, b, c, and d.
It is important to remember that multiplying or dividing both sides of an
inequality by a negative real number reverses the inequality sign (see prop-
erty 4). Properties similar to those above are true for other inequalities and for
and 
. Thus, if 
, then 
; if 
and 
, then
; and so on.
If x represents a real number, then, by property 2, adding or subtracting
the same expression containing x on both sides of an inequality yields an
equivalent inequality. By property 3, we may multiply or divide both sides of
an inequality by an expression containing x if we are certain that the expres-
sion is positive for all values of x under consideration. To illustrate, multipli-
cation or division by 
would be permissible, since this
expression is always positive. If we multiply or divide both sides of an in-
equality by an expression that is always negative, such as 
, then, by
property 4, the inequality is reversed.
In examples we shall describe solutions of inequalities by means of inter-
vals and also represent them graphically.

To solve an inequality involving polynomials of degree greater than 1, we shall
express each polynomial as a product of linear factors 
and/or irre-
ducible quadratic factors 
. If any such factor is not zero in an in-
terval, then it is either positive throughout the interval or negative throughout the
interval. Hence, if we choose any k in the interval and if the factor is positive

The value of the factor at

The factors 
and 
are zero at 
and , respectively. The corre-
sponding points on a coordinate line (see Figure 1) determine the noninter-
secting intervals
We may find the signs of 
and 
in each interval by using a test
value taken from each interval. To illustrate, if we choose 
in
, the values of both 
and 
are negative, and hence they
are negative throughout 
. A similar procedure for the remaining two
intervals gives us the following sign chart, where the term resulting sign in the
last row refers to the sign obtained by applying laws of signs to the product of
the factors. Note that the resulting sign is positive or negative according to
whether the number of negative signs of factors is even or odd, respectively.
Sometimes it is convenient to represent the signs of 
and 
by
using a coordinate line and a sign diagram, of the type illustrated in Figure 2.
The vertical lines indicate where the factors are zero, and signs of factors are
shown above the coordinate line. The resulting signs are shown in red.

Since 0 is already on the right side of the inequality and the left
side is factored, we may proceed directly to the sign diagram in Figure 4,
where the vertical lines indicate the zeros 
,
, and 3 of the factors.
Figure 4
The frame around the 
indicates that 
makes a factor in the denominator
of the original inequality equal to 0. Since the quadratic factor 
is 
always positive, it has no effect on the sign of the quotient and hence may 
be omitted from the diagram.
The various signs of the factors can be found using test values. Alterna-
tively, we need only remember that as x increases, the sign of a linear factor
changes from negative to positive if the coefficient a of x is positive,
and the sign changes from positive to negative if a is negative.
To determine where the quotient is less than or equal to 0, we first note
from the sign diagram that it is negative for numbers in 
.
Since the quotient is 0 at 
and 
, the numbers 
and 3 are also
solutions and must be included in our solution. Lastly, the quotient is unde-
fined at 
, so 
must be excluded from our solution. Thus, the solu-

SOLUT ION
A common mistake in solving such an inequality is to first
multiply both sides by 
. If we did so, we would have to consider two
cases, since 
may be positive or negative (assuming 
), and we
might have to reverse the inequality. A simpler method is to first obtain an
equivalent inequality that has 0 on the right side and proceed from there:
given
make one side 0
combine into one fraction
simplify
multiply by 
Note that the direction of the inequality is changed in the last step, since we
multiplied by a negative number. This multiplication was performed for con-
venience, so that all factors would have positive coefficients of x.
The factors 
and 
are 0 at 
and 
, respectively.
This leads to the sign diagram in Figure 6, where the signs are determined as
in previous examples. We see from the diagram that the resulting sign, and
hence the sign of the quotient, is positive in 
. The quo-
tient is 0 at 
(include 
) and undefined at

Hence, the solution of

Determining minimum therapeutic levels
For a drug to have a beneficial effect, its concentration in the bloodstream must
exceed a certain value, which is called the minimum therapeutic level. Suppose
that the concentration c (in mg L) of a particular drug t hours after it is taken
orally is given by
If the minimum therapeutic level is 4 mg L, determine when this level is
exceeded.
SOLUT ION
The minimum therapeutic level, 4 mg L, is exceeded if 
. Thus, we must solve the inequality
Since 
for every t, we may multiply both sides by 
and pro-
ceed as follows:
allowable, since 
make one side 0
divide by the common factor 
factor
The factors in the last inequality are 0 when 
and 
. These are the
times at which c is equal to 4. As in previous examples, we may use a sign
chart or sign diagram (with 
) to show that 
for every t
in the interval 
. Hence, the minimum therapeutic level is exceeded if
.

The mathematical term function (or its Latin equivalent) dates back to the
late seventeenth century, when calculus was in the early stages of develop-
ment. This important concept is now the backbone of advanced courses in
mathematics and is indispensable in every field of science.
In this chapter we study properties of functions using algebraic and
graphical methods that include plotting points, determining symmetries,
and making horizontal and vertical shifts. These techniques are adequate for
obtaining rough sketches of graphs that help us understand properties of
functions; modern-day methods, however, employ sophisticated computer
software and advanced mathematics to generate extremely accurate graph-
ical representations of functions.

In Section 1.1 we discussed how to assign a real number (coordinate) to each
point on a line. We shall now show how to assign an ordered pair
of real
numbers to each point in a plane. Although we have also used the notation 
to denote an open interval, there is little chance for confusion, since it should al-
ways be clear from our discussion whether 
represents a point or an interval.
We introduce a rectangular, or Cartesian,* coordinate system in a plane
by means of two perpendicular coordinate lines, called coordinate axes, that
intersect at the origin O, as shown in Figure 1. We often refer to the horizon-
tal line as the x-axis and the vertical line as the y-axis and label them x and y,
respectively. The plane is then a coordinate plane, or an xy-plane. The coor-
dinate axes divide the plane into four parts called the first, second, third, and
fourth quadrants, labeled I, II, III, and IV, respectively (see Figure 1). Points
on the axes do not belong to any quadrant. 
Each point P in an xy-plane may be assigned an ordered pair 
, as
shown in Figure 1. We call a the x-coordinate (or abscissa) of P, and b the
y-coordinate (or ordinate). We say that P has coordinates
and refer to
the point
or the point
. Conversely, every ordered pair 
de-
termines a point P with coordinates a and b. We plot a point by using a dot,
as illustrated in Figure 2.
We may use the following formula to find the distance between two points
in a coordinate plane.

*The term Cartesian is used in honor of the French mathematician and philosopher René

PROOF
If

theorem,
From the figure we see that
Since
for every real number a, we may write
Taking the square root of each side of the last equation and using the fact that
gives us the distance formula.
If 
, the points 
and 
lie on the same horizontal line, and 
Similarly, if 
, the points are on the same vertical line, and
These are special cases of the distance formula.
Although we referred to the points shown in Figure 3, our proof is inde-
pendent of the positions of 
and

L
When applying the distance formula, note that 
and,
hence, the order in which we subtract the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates
of the points is immaterial. We may think of the distance between two points
as the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

Graphs are often used to illustrate changes in quantities. A graph in the busi-
ness section of a newspaper may show the fluctuation of the Dow-Jones aver-
age during a given month; a meteorologist might use a graph to indicate how
the air temperature varied throughout a day; a cardiologist employs graphs
(electrocardiograms) to analyze heart irregularities; an engineer or physicist
may turn to a graph to illustrate the manner in which the pressure of a confined
gas increases as the gas is heated. Such visual aids usually reveal the behavior
of quantities more readily than a long table of numerical values.
Two quantities are sometimes related by means of an equation or formula
that involves two variables. In this section we discuss how to represent such an
equation geometrically, by a graph in a coordinate plane. The graph may then
be used to discover properties of the quantities that are not evident from the
equation alone. The following chart introduces the basic concept of the graph
of an equation in two variables x and y. Of course, other letters can also be
used for the variables.

For each solution 
of an equation in x and y there is a point 
in a coordinate plane. The set of all such points is called the graph of the
equation. To sketch the graph of an equation, we illustrate the significant fea-
tures of the graph in a coordinate plane. In simple cases, a graph can be
sketched by plotting few, if any, points. For a complicated equation, plotting
points may give very little information about the graph. In such cases, meth-
ods of calculus or computer graphics are often employed. Let us begin with a
simple example.
E X A M P L E  1

.
SOLUT ION
We wish to find the points 
in a coordinate plane that cor-
respond to the solutions of the equation. It is convenient to list coordinates of
several such points in a table, where for each x we obtain the value for y from
:
The points with these coordinates appear to lie on a line, and we can sketch
the graph in Figure 1. Ordinarily, the few points we have plotted would not be
enough to illustrate the graph of an equation; however, in this elementary case
we can be reasonably sure that the graph is a line. In the next section we will
establish this fact.
L
It is impossible to sketch the entire graph in Example 1, because we can as-
sign values to x that are numerically as large as desired. Nevertheless, we call the
drawing in Figure 1 the graph of the equation or a sketch of the graph. In gen-
eral, the sketch of a graph should illustrate its essential features so that the re-
maining (unsketched) parts are self-evident. For instance, in Figure 1, the end
behavior—the pattern of the graph as x assumes large positive and negative val-
ues (that is, the shape of the right and left ends)—is apparent to the reader.
If a graph terminates at some point (as would be the case for a half-line or
line segment), we place a dot at the appropriate endpoint of the graph. As a
final general remark, if ticks on the coordinate axes are not labeled (as in Fig-
ure 1), then each tick represents one unit. We shall label ticks only when dif-
ferent units are used on the axes. For arbitrary graphs, where units of
measurement are irrelevant, we omit ticks completely (see, for example, Fig-
ures 5 and 6).

Substituting values for x and finding the corresponding values
of y using 
, we obtain a table of coordinates for several points on
the graph:
Larger values of 
produce larger values of y. For example, the points
,
, and 
are on the graph, as are 
,
, and
. Plotting the points given by the table and drawing a smooth curve
through these points (in the order of increasing values of x) gives us the sketch
in Figure 2.
L
The graph in Figure 2 is a parabola, and the y-axis is the axis of the
parabola. The lowest point 
is the vertex of the parabola, and we say
that the parabola opens upward. If we invert the graph, then the parabola opens
downward and the vertex is the highest point on the graph. In general, the
graph of any equation of the form 
with 
is a parabola with
vertex 
, opening upward if 
or downward if 
. If 
, the
equation reduces to 
and the vertex is at the origin 
. Parabolas
may also open to the right or to the left (see Example 4) or in other directions.
We shall use the following terminology to describe where the graph of an
equation in x and y intersects the x-axis or the y-axis.

If the coordinate plane in Figure 2 is folded along the y-axis, the graph
that lies in the left half of the plane coincides with that in the right half, and
we say that the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. A graph is
symmetric with respect to the y-axis provided that the point 
is on
the graph whenever 
is on the graph. The graph of 
in Ex-
ample 2 has this property, since substitution of 
for x yields the same
equation:
This substitution is an application of symmetry test 1 in the following chart.
Two other types of symmetry and the appropriate tests are also listed. The

If a graph is symmetric with respect to an axis, it is sufficient to determine
the graph in half of the coordinate plane, since we can sketch the remainder of

If we simultaneously substitute

Multiplying both sides by

symmetric with respect to the origin—and if the point 
is on the graph,
then the point 
is on the graph. The following table lists coordinates
of some points on the graph.
Because of the symmetry, we can see that the points

the distance formula,
The above equation is equivalent to the following equation, which we will
refer to as the standard equation of a circle.

Next, we rewrite the equation as follows, where the underscored spaces repre-

We then complete the squares for the expressions within parentheses, taking
care to add the appropriate numbers to both sides of the equation. To complete

One of the basic concepts in geometry is that of a line. In this section we will
restrict our discussion to lines that lie in a coordinate plane. This will allow us
to use algebraic methods to study their properties. Two of our principal objec-
tives may be stated as follows:
(1) Given a line l in a coordinate plane, find an equation whose graph corre-
sponds to l.
(2) Given an equation of a line l in a coordinate plane, sketch the graph of the
equation.
The following concept is fundamental to the study of lines.
3.3
Lines
Definition of Slope of a Line
Let l be a line that is not parallel to the y-axis, and let 
and
be distinct points on l. The slope m of l is
If l is parallel to the y-axis, then the slope of l is not defined.

Typical points 
and 
on a line l are shown in Figure 1. The numerator
in the formula for m is the vertical change in direction from 
to 
and may be positive, negative, or zero. The denominator 
is the hori-
zontal change from 
to 
, and it may be positive or negative, but never zero,
because l is not parallel to the y-axis if a slope exists. In Figure 1(a) the slope
is positive, and we say that the line rises. In Figure 1(b) the slope is negative,
and the line falls.
In finding the slope of a line it is immaterial which point we label as 
and which as 
, since
If the points are labeled so that 
, as in Figure 1, then 
, and
hence the slope is positive, negative, or zero, depending on whether 
,
, or 
, respectively.
The definition of slope is independent of the two points that are chosen on
l. If other points 
and 
are used, then, as in Figure 2, the tri-
angle with vertices 
,
, and 
is similar to the triangle with vertices
,
, and 
. Since the ratios of corresponding sides of similar trian-
gles are equal,

The diagram in Figure 5 indicates the slopes of several lines through the
origin. The line that lies on the x-axis has slope 
. If this line is rotated
about O in the counterclockwise direction (as indicated by the blue arrow),
the slope is positive and increases, reaching the value 1 when the line bisects
the first quadrant and continuing to increase as the line gets closer to the
y-axis. If we rotate the line of slope 
in the clockwise direction (as in-
dicated by the red arrow), the slope is negative, reaching the value 
when
the line bisects the second quadrant and becoming large and negative as the
line gets closer to the y-axis.

Finding an equation of a line parallel to a given line
Find an equation of the line through 
that is parallel to the line
.
SOLUT ION
We first express the given equation in slope-intercept form:
given
subtract 6x
divide by 3
The last equation is in slope-intercept form,
, with slope 
and y-intercept 
Since parallel lines have the same slope, the required line
also has slope 
. Using the point 
gives us the following:
point-slope form
simplify
subtract 7
The last equation is in slope-intercept form and shows that the parallel line
we have found has y-intercept 3. This line and the given line are sketched in
Figure 12.
As an alternative solution, we might use the fact that lines of the form
have the same slope as the given line and hence are parallel to it.
Substituting 
and 
into the equation 
gives us
or, equivalently,
. The equation 
is
equivalent to 
.
L
If the slopes of two nonvertical lines are not the same, then the lines are
not parallel and intersect at exactly one point.
The next theorem gives us information about perpendicular lines (lines
that intersect at a right angle).
PROOF
For simplicity, let us consider the special case of two lines that in-
tersect at the origin O, as illustrated in Figure 13. Equations of these lines are
and 
. If, as in the figure, we choose points 
and
different from O on the lines, then the lines are perpendicular if and
only if angle AOB is a right angle. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we
know that angle AOB is a right angle if and only if
or, by the distance formula,

The relationship between the air temperature T (in °F) and the altitude h (in

the terrain and structures near ground level. In Montreal,
the average daytime value for P with north winds over

the average wind shear (see Exercise 67) between 20 feet

The notion of correspondence occurs frequently in everyday life. Some ex-
amples are given in the following illustration.
Correspondence
To each book in a library there corresponds the number of pages in the
book.
To each human being there corresponds a birth date.
If the temperature of the air is recorded throughout the day, then to each
instant of time there corresponds a temperature.
3.4
Definition of Function
I L L U S T R A T I O N
Each correspondence in the previous illustration involves two sets, D and
E. In the first illustration, D denotes the set of books in a library and E the set
of positive integers. To each book x in D there corresponds a positive integer
y in E—namely, the number of pages in the book.
We sometimes depict correspondences by diagrams of the type shown in
Figure 1, where the sets D and E are represented by points within regions in a
plane. The curved arrow indicates that the element y of E corresponds to the
element x of D. The two sets may have elements in common. As a matter of
fact, we often have 
. It is important to note that to each x in D there cor-
responds exactly one y in E. However, the same element of E may correspond
to different elements of D. For example, two books may have the same num-
ber of pages, two people may have the same birthday, and the temperature may
be the same at different times.
In most of our work, D and E will be sets of numbers. To illustrate, let
both D and E denote the set  of real numbers, and to each real number x let
us assign its square 
. This gives us a correspondence from  to .
Each of our illustrations of a correspondence is a function, which we de-
fine as follows.
The element x of D is the argument of f. The set D is the domain of the func-
tion. The element y of E is the value of f at x (or the image of x under f ) and
is denoted by 
, read “f of x.” The range of f is the subset R of E consisting
of all possible values 
for x in D. Note that there may be elements in the
set E that are not in the range R of f.
Consider the diagram in Figure 2. The curved arrows indicate that the el-
ements 
,
,
, and 
of E correspond to the elements w, z, x, and
a of D. To each element in D there is assigned exactly one function value in E;
however, different elements of D, such as w and z in Figure 2, may have the
same value in E.
The symbols
and
signify that f is a function from D to E, and we say that f maps D into E. Ini-
tially, the notations f and 
may be confusing. Remember that f is used to
represent the function. It is neither in D nor in E. However,

Definition of Function
A function f from a set D to a set E is a correspondence that assigns to
each element x of D exactly one element y of E.
For many cases, we can simply re-
member that the domain is the set of
x-values and the range is the set of 
y-values.

of the range R—the element that the function f assigns to the element x, which
is in the domain D.
Two functions f and g from D to E are equal, and we write
provided
for every x in D.
For example, if 
and 
for every x in , then

for every x in .
(a) Find 
,
,
, and 
, where a and b are real
numbers.
(b) What is the range of f ?
SOLUT ION
(a) We find values of f by substituting for x in the equation 
:
(b) By definition, the range of f consists of all numbers of the form 
for x in . Since the square of every real number is nonnegative, the range is
contained in the set of all nonnegative real numbers. Moreover, every non-
negative real number c is a value of f, since 
. Hence,
the range of f is the set of all nonnegative real numbers.
L
If a function is defined as in Example 1, the symbols used for the function
and variable are immaterial; that is, expressions such as 
,
,
, and 
all define the same function. This is true because if a
is any number in the domain, then the same value 
is obtained regardless of
which expression is employed.
In the remainder of our work, the phrase f is a function will mean that the
domain and range are sets of real numbers. If a function is defined by means
of an expression, as in Example 1, and the domain D is not stated, then we will
consider D to be the totality of real numbers x such that 
is real. This is
sometimes called the implied domain of f. To illustrate, if 
,
then the implied domain is the set of real numbers x such that 
is
real—that is,
, or 
. Thus, the domain is the infinite interval
. If x is in the domain, we say that f is defined at x or that 
exists. If

Functions are commonplace in everyday life and show up in a variety of

An example of a function given by a rule can be found in the federal tax

$15,107.50 plus 28% of the amount over $74,200.

Graphs are often used to describe the variation of physical quantities. For
example, a scientist may use the graph in Figure 5 to indicate the temperature
T of a certain solution at various times t during an experiment. The sketch
shows that the temperature increased gradually for time 
to time 
,
did not change between 
and 
, and then decreased rapidly from
to 
.
Similarly, if f is a function, we may use a graph to indicate the change in
as x varies through the domain of f. Specifically, we have the following
definition.
We often attach the label 
to a sketch of the graph. If 
is a
point on the graph, then the y-coordinate b is the function value 
, as illus-
trated in Figure 6 on the next page. The figure displays the domain of f (the set
of possible values of x) and the range of f (the corresponding values of y). Al-
though we have pictured the domain and range as closed intervals, they may
be infinite intervals or other sets of real numbers.
Since there is exactly one value 
for each a in the domain of f, only
one point on the graph of f has x-coordinate a. In general, we may use the fol-
lowing graphical test to determine whether a graph is the graph of a function.

Vertical Line Test
The graph of a set of points in a coordinate plane is the graph of a function
if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point.
Thus, every vertical line intersects the graph of a function in at most
one point. Consequently, the graph of a function cannot be a figure such as
a circle, in which a vertical line may intersect the graph in more than one
point.
The x-intercepts of the graph of a function f are the solutions of the equa-
tion 
. These numbers are called the zeros of the function. The 
y-intercept of the graph is 
, if it exists.

SOLUT ION
(a) By definition, the graph of f is the graph of the equation 
.
The following table lists coordinates of several points on the graph.
Plotting points, we obtain the sketch shown in Figure 7. Note that the 
x-intercept is 1 and there is no y-intercept.
(b) Referring to Figure 7, note that the domain of f consists of all real num-
bers x such that 
or, equivalently, the interval [1, ). The range of f is the
set of all real numbers y such that 
or, equivalently, [0, ).
L
The square root function, defined by 
, has a graph similar to
the one in Figure 7, but the endpoint is at (0, 0). The y-value of a point on this
graph is the number displayed on a calculator when a square root is requested.
This graphical relationship may help you remember that 
is 3 and that 
is not
. Similarly,

, and 
are often referred
to as the squaring function, the cubing function, and the cube root function,
respectively.
In Example 3, as x increases, the function value 
also increases, and
we say that the graph of f rises (see Figure 7). A function of this type is said
to be increasing. For certain functions,
decreases as x increases. In this

Definition of Linear Function
A function f is a linear function if
where x is any real number and a and b are constants.
fx  ax  b,
Thus, the graph of a linear function is a line. Since 
exists for every x, the
domain of f is . As illustrated in the next example, if 
, then the range
of f is also .

(a) Sketch the graph of f.
(b) Find the domain and range of f.

SOLUT ION

, f is a linear func-
tion. The graph of 
is the line with slope 2 and y-intercept 3, illus-
trated in Figure 10.
(b) We see from the graph that x and y may be any real numbers, so both the
domain and the range of f are .
(c) Since the slope a is positive, the graph of f rises as x increases; that is,
whenever 
. Thus, f is increasing throughout its domain.L
In applications it is sometimes necessary to determine a specific linear
function from given data, as in the next example.

Many formulas that occur in mathematics and the sciences determine
functions. For instance, the formula 
for the area A of a circle of ra-
dius r assigns to each positive real number r exactly one value of A. This de-
termines a function f such that 
, and we may write 
. The
letter r, which represents an arbitrary number from the domain of f, is called
an independent variable. The letter A, which represents a number from the
range of f, is a dependent variable, since its value depends on the number as-
signed to r. If two variables r and A are related in this manner, we say that A
is a function of r. In applications, the independent variable and dependent vari-
able are sometimes referred to as the input variable and output variable, re-
spectively. As another example, if an automobile travels at a uniform rate of
50 mi hr, then the distance d (miles) traveled in time t (hours) is given by
, and hence the distance d is a function of time t.

Expressing the volume of a tank as a function of its radius
A steel storage tank for propane gas is to be constructed in the shape of a right
circular cylinder of altitude 10 feet with a hemisphere attached to each end.
The radius r is yet to be determined. Express the volume V (in 
) of the tank
as a function of r (in feet).
SOLUT ION
The tank is illustrated in Figure 12. We may find the volume of
the cylindrical part of the tank by multiplying the altitude 10 by the area 
of the base of the cylinder. This gives us
The two hemispherical ends, taken together, form a sphere of radius r. Using
the formula for the volume of a sphere, we obtain
Thus, the volume V of the tank is
This formula expresses V as a function of r. In factored form,

Since distance

Substitution in

L
Ordered pairs can be used to obtain an alternative approach to functions.
We first observe that a function f from D to E determines the following set W
of ordered pairs:
Thus, W consists of all ordered pairs such that the first number x is in D and
the second number is the function value 
. In Example 1, where 
,
W is the set of all ordered pairs of the form 
. It is important to note that,
for each x, there is exactly one ordered pair
in W having x in the first
position.
Conversely, if we begin with a set W of ordered pairs such that each x in
D appears exactly once in the first position of an ordered pair, then W deter-
mines a function. Specifically, for each x in D there is exactly one pair 
in W, and by letting y correspond to x, we obtain a function with domain D.
The range consists of all real numbers y that appear in the second position of
the ordered pairs.
It follows from the preceding discussion that the next statement could also
be used as a definition of function.
In terms of the preceding definition, the ordered pairs 
deter-
mine the function of Example 3 given by 
. Note, however,
that if
then W is not a function, since for a given x there may be more than one pair
in W with x in the first position. For example, if 
, then both 
and
are in W.
As a reference aid, some common graphs and their equations are listed in
Appendix I. Many of these graphs are graphs of functions.

In this section we discuss aids for sketching graphs of certain types of func-
tions. In particular, a function f is called even if 
for every x in its
domain. In this case, the equation 
is not changed if 
is substituted
for x, and hence, from symmetry test 1 of Section 3.2, the graph of an even
function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
A function f is called odd if 
for every x in its domain. If
we apply symmetry test 3 of Section 3.2 to the equation 
, we see that
the graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin.
These facts are summarized in the first two columns of the next chart.

(a) To sketch the graph of

in
Figure 4 and multiply the y-coordinate of each point by 4. This stretches the
graph of 
vertically by a factor 4 and gives us a narrower parabola that
is sharper at the vertex, as illustrated in the figure.
(b) The graph of

of points on the graph of

This compresses the graph of 
ver-
tically by a factor 
and gives us a wider parabola that is flatter at the
vertex, as shown in Figure 4.

We may obtain the graph of

each point on the graph of

. Thus, every point 
on the 
graph of

on the
graph of 
that lies below the x-axis. Similarly, if 
lies below 
the x-axis (that is,
), then 
lies above the x-axis. The graph of

called a transformation of the original graph. A graphical summary of the
types of transformations encountered in this section appears in Appendix II.

a vertical axis, opening upward if 
or downward if

ample, Figures 4 and 5 in Section 3.5). In this section we show that the graph
of an equation of the form
can be obtained by vertical and/or horizontal shifts of the graph of 
and
hence is also a parabola. An important application of such equations is to de-
scribe the trajectory, or path, of an object near the surface of the earth when
the only force acting on the object is gravitational attraction. To illustrate, if an
outfielder on a baseball team throws a ball into the infield, as illustrated in
Figure 1, and if air resistance and other outside forces are negligible, then the
path of the ball is a parabola. If suitable coordinate axes are introduced, then
the path coincides with the graph of the equation 
for some
a, b, and c. We call the function determined by this equation a quadratic
function.
If

and, from our discussion of vertical shifts in Section 3.5, the graph is a
parabola with vertex at the point

SOLUT ION
Figure 8 shows the vertex V, the point

sition of the parabola. Using the standard equation
with

To find a, we use the fact that 
is on the parabola and so is a solution of
the last equation. Thus,
Hence, an equation for the parabola is
L
The next theorem gives us a simple formula for locating the vertex of a
parabola.
PROOF
Let us begin by writing 
as
Next we complete the square by adding 
to the expression within
parentheses:
Note that if 
is added inside the parentheses, then, because of the fac-
tor a on the outside, we have actually added 
to y. Therefore, we must
compensate by subtracting 
. The last equation may be written
This is the equation of a parabola that has vertex

It is unnecessary to remember the formula for the y-coordinate of the ver-

for x in the
equation of the parabola.

SOLUT ION
We considered this parabola in Example 3 and found the ver-
tex by completing the square. We shall use the vertex formula with 
and
, obtaining the x-coordinate
We next find the y-coordinate by substituting for x in the given equation:
Thus, the vertex is 
(see Figure 5).
L
Since the graph of 
for 
is a parabola, we can
use the vertex formula to help find the maximum or minimum value of a quad-
ratic function. Specifically, since the x-coordinate of the vertex V is 
,
the y-coordinate of V is the function value 
. Moreover, since the
parabola opens downward if 
and upward if 
, this function value is
the maximum or minimum value, respectively, of f. We may summarize these
facts as follows.
We shall use this theorem in the next example.

The gutter is illustrated in Figure 9. If x denotes the number of
inches turned up on each side, the width of the base of the gutter is 
inches. The capacity will be greatest when the cross-sectional area of the rec-
tangle with sides of lengths x and 
has its greatest value. Letting 
denote this area, we have
which has the form 
with 
,
, and 
.
Since f is a quadratic function and 
, it follows from the preceding
theorem that the maximum value of f occurs at
Thus, 3 inches should be turned up on each side to achieve maximum capacity.
As an alternative solution, we may note that the graph of the function
has x-intercepts at 
and 
. Hence, the average of
the intercepts,
is the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola and the value that yields the
maximum capacity.

Functions are often defined using sums, differences, products, and quotients of
various expressions. For example, if
we may regard 
as a sum of values of the functions f and g given by
We call h the sum of f and g and denote it by

In general, if f and g are any functions, we use the terminology and notation
given in the following chart.
The domains of

of f and g—that is, the numbers that are common to both domains. The domain

A function f is a polynomial function if 
is a polynomial—that is, if
where the coefficients 
,
, . . . ,
are real numbers and the exponents are
nonnegative integers. A polynomial function may be regarded as a sum of
functions whose values are of the form 
, where c is a real number and k is
a nonnegative integer. Note that the quadratic functions considered in the pre-
vious section are polynomial functions.
An algebraic function is a function that can be expressed in terms of fi-
nite sums, differences, products, quotients, or roots of polynomial functions.
Algebraic Function
Functions that are not algebraic are transcendental. The exponential and
logarithmic functions considered in Chapter 5 are examples of transcendental
functions.
In the remainder of this section we shall discuss how two functions f and
g may be used to obtain the composite functions
and 
(read “f circle
g” and “g circle f,” respectively). Functions of this type are very important in
calculus. The function

Figure 1 is a schematic diagram that illustrates relationships among f, g,

For the composite function 
, we reverse this order, first finding 
and second finding 
. The domain of 
is the set of all x in the do-
main of f such that 
is in the domain of g.
Since the notation 
is read “g of x,” we sometimes say that g is a func-
tion of x. For the composite function 
, the notation 
is read “f of g
of x,” and we could regard f as a function of 
. In this sense, a composite
function is a function of a function or, more precisely, a function of another
function’s values.

balloon as a function of time t (in seconds).
SOLUT ION
Let x denote the radius of the balloon. If we assume that the ra-

radius of balloon after t seconds
To illustrate, after 1 second, the radius is 1.5 centimeters; after 2 seconds, it is
3.0 centimeters; after 3 seconds, it is 4.5 centimeters; and so on.
Next we write
volume of a sphere of radius x
This gives us a composite function relationship in which V is a function of x,
and x is a function of t. By substitution, we obtain

Polynomial functions are the most basic functions in mathematics, because
they are defined only in terms of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
In applications it is often necessary to sketch their graphs and to find (or ap-
proximate) their zeros. In the first part of this chapter we discuss results that
are useful in obtaining this information. We then turn our attention to quo-
tients of polynomial functions—that is, rational functions.

If f is a polynomial function with real coefficients of degree n, then
with 
. The special cases listed in the following chart were previously
discussed.
In this section we shall discuss graphs of polynomial functions of degree
greater than 2. All polynomial functions are continuous functions—that is,
their graphs can be drawn without any breaks.
If f has degree n and all the coefficients except
are zero, then
In this case, if 
, the graph of f is a line through the origin. If 
, the
graph is a parabola with vertex at the origin. Two illustrations with 
(cubic polynomials) are given in the next example.

Since f is an odd function, the graph of f is symmetric with respect to the

, the graph is similar in shape to that in Figure 1; however, as
either n or a increases, the graph rises more rapidly for 
. If 
, we re-
flect the graph through the x-axis, as in Figure 2.
If 
and n is an even positive integer, then f is an even function
and the graph of f is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 3 for the case 
and 
. Note that as the exponent increases, the
graph becomes flatter at the origin. It also rises more rapidly for 
. If
, we reflect the graph through the x-axis. Also note that the graph inter-
sects the x-axis at the origin, but it does not cross the x-axis (change sign).
A complete analysis of graphs of polynomial functions of degree greater
than 2 requires methods that are used in calculus. As the degree increases, the
graphs usually become more complicated. They always have a smooth ap-
pearance, however, with a number of high points and low points, such as P, Q,
R, and S in Figure 4. Such points are sometimes called turning points for the
graph. It should be noted that an n-degree polynomial has at most 
turn-
ing points. Each function value (y-coordinate) corresponding to a high or low
point is called an extremum of the function f. At an extremum, f changes from
an increasing function to a decreasing function, or vice versa.
The intermediate value theorem specifies another important property of
polynomial functions.
The intermediate value theorem for polynomial functions states that if w is
any number between 
and 
, there is at least one number c between a
and b such that 
. If we regard the graph of f as extending continuously

for any number w between

intersects
the graph in at least one point P. The x-coordinate c of P is a number such
that 
.
A consequence of the intermediate value theorem is that if 
and 
have opposite signs (one positive and one negative), there is at least one num-
ber c between a and b such that 
; that is, f has a zero at c. Thus, if the
point 
lies below the x-axis and the point 
lies above the x-axis,
or vice versa, the graph crosses the x-axis at least once between 
and

Example 2 illustrates a method for locating real zeros of polynomials. By
using successive approximations, we can approximate each zero at any degree
of accuracy by locating it in smaller and smaller intervals.
If c and d are successive at real zeros of

zeros between c and d—then

Thus, if we choose any number k such that

terval

of test values in graphing is similar to the technique used for inequalities in

similar to that of Figure 8, or it has an inverted version of that graph if the co-

Since the sign of

, the
graph of f must be below the x-axis, as shown in Figure 12. In the interval
, the sign of 
is positive, so the graph of f is above the x-axis.
The sign of

. Thus, the
graph of f must touch the x-axis at the x-intercept 
and then remain above
the x-axis. (The graph of f is tangent to the x-axis at

In the interval 
, the sign of

The long division process ends when we arrive at a polynomial (the re-
mainder) that either is 0 or has smaller degree than the divisor. The result of
the long division in the preceding illustration can be written
Multiplying both sides of this equation by 
, we obtain
This example illustrates the following theorem.
A useful special case of the division algorithm for polynomials occurs if
is divided by 
, where c is a real number. If 
is a factor of

then
for some quotient 
, and the remainder 
is 0. If 
is not a factor of

is less than the degree of

hence 
must have degree 0. This means that the remainder is a nonzero
number. Consequently, for every

where the remainder d is a real number (possibly 
). If we substitute c for
x, we obtain

L
Example 6 shows that the number 
is a solution of the equation
. In Section 4.4 we shall use synthetic division to
find rational solutions of equations.
At this stage you should recognize that the following three statements are
equivalent for a polynomial function f whose graph is the graph of the equa-
tion 
.
(1) The point 
is on the graph of f.
(2) The value of f at 
equals b; that is,
.
(3) If 
is divided by 
, then the remainder is b.
Furthermore, if b is equal to 0, then the next four statements are also
equivalent.
(1) The number a is a zero of the function f.
(2) The point 
is on the graph of f ; that is, a is an x-intercept.
(3) The number a is a solution of the equation 
.
(4) The binomial 
is a factor of the polynomial 
.
You should become familiar with these statements—so familiar that if
you know one of them is true, you can easily recall and apply any appropriate
equivalent statement.

Zeros of Polynomials
The zeros of a polynomial
are the solutions of the equation 
.
Each real zero is an x-intercept of the graph of f. In applied fields, calculators
and computers are usually used to find or approximate zeros. Before using a
calculator, however, it is worth knowing what type of zeros to expect. Some
questions we could ask are
(1) How many zeros of 
are real? imaginary?
(2) How many real zeros of 
are positive? negative?
(3) How many real zeros of 
are rational? irrational?
(4) Are the real zeros of

In this and the following section we shall discuss results that help answer some
of these questions. These results form the basis of the theory of equations.
The factor and remainder theorems can be extended to the system of com-
plex numbers. Thus, a complex number 
is a zero of a polynomial
if and only if 
is a factor of 
. Except in special cases, zeros of
polynomials are very difficult to find. For example, there are no obvious zeros
of 
. Although we have no formula that can
be used to find the zeros, the next theorem states that there is at least one zero
c, and hence, by the factor theorem,
has a factor of the form 
.
The standard proof of this theorem requires results from an advanced field
of mathematics called functions of a complex variable. A prerequisite for
studying this field is a strong background in calculus. The first proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra was given by the German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), who is considered by many to be the greatest
mathematician of all time.
As a special case of the fundamental theorem of algebra, if all the coeffi-
cients of 
are real, then 
has at least one complex zero. If 
is a com-
plex zero, it may happen that 
, in which case the number a is a real zero.
The fundamental theorem of algebra enables us, at least in theory, to ex-
press every polynomial 
of positive degree as a product of polynomials of
degree 1, as in the next theorem.
PROOF
If 
has degree 
, then, by the fundamental theorem of 
algebra,
has a complex zero . Hence, by the factor theorem,
has a
factor 
; that is,
where 
is a polynomial of degree 
. If 
, then, by the same
argument,
has a complex zero 
and therefore a factor 
. Thus,

The numbers 
in the complete factorization theorem are
not necessarily all different. To illustrate,

factorization
If a factor 
occurs m times in the factorization, then c is a zero of multi-
plicity m of the polynomial 
, or a root of multiplicity m of the equation
. In the preceding display, 1 is a zero of multiplicity 2, and 
is a
zero of multiplicity 1.
If c is a real zero of 
of multiplicity m, then 
has the factor
and the graph of f has an x-intercept c. The general shape of the graph
at 
depends on whether m is an odd integer or an even integer. If m is odd,
then 
changes sign as x increases through c, and hence the graph of f
crosses the x-axis at

The figures in the chart do not show the complete graph of f, but only its gen-
eral shape near

does not change sign at c and
the graph of f near

Finding multiplicities of zeros
Find the zeros of the polynomial 
, state the
multiplicity of each, and then sketch the graph of f.
SOLUT ION
We see from the factored form that 
has three distinct zeros,
2, 4, and 
. The zero 2 has multiplicity 1, the zero 4 has multiplicity 3, and
the zero 
has multiplicity 2. Note that 
has degree 6.
The x-intercepts of the graph of f are the real zeros 
, and 4. Since the
multiplicity of 
is an even integer, the graph intersects, but does not cross,
the x-axis at 
. Since the multiplicities of 2 and 4 are odd, the graph
crosses the x-axis at 
and 
. (Note that the graph is “flatter” at 4 than
at 2.) The y-intercept is 
. The graph is shown in
Figure 1.
L
If 
is a polynomial of degree n, then
the n complex numbers 
are zeros of 
. Counting a zero of mul-
tiplicity m as m zeros tells us that 
has at least n zeros (not necessarily all
different). Combining this fact with the fact that 
has at most n zeros gives
us the next result.

Hence, by the factor theorem,

about the zeros of a polynomial 
with real coefficients. In the statement of
the rule we assume that the terms of 
are arranged in order of decreasing
powers of x and that terms with zero coefficients are deleted. We also assume
that the constant term—that is, the term that does not contain x—is different
from 0. We say there is a variation of sign in 
if two consecutive coeffi-
cients have opposite signs. To illustrate, the polynomial 
in the following
illustration has three variations of sign, as indicated by the braces—one varia-
tion from

The polynomial

trations. Since there are three variations of sign in 
, the equation has either
three positive real solutions or one positive real solution.
Since

Descartes’ Rule of Signs
Let

(1) The number of positive real zeros of

of variations of sign in 
or is less than that number by an even
integer.
(2) The number of negative real zeros of

Descartes’ rule stipulates that the constant term of the polynomial 
is
different from 0. If the constant term is 0, as in the equation
we factor out the lowest power of x, obtaining
Thus, one solution is 
, and we apply Descartes’ rule to the polynomial
to determine the nature of the remaining three solutions.
When applying Descartes’ rule, we count roots of multiplicity k as k roots.
For example, given 
, the polynomial 
has two
variations of sign, and hence the equation has either two positive real roots or
none. The factored form of the equation is 
, and hence 1 is a root
of multiplicity 2.
We next discuss the bounds for the real zeros of a polynomial 
that has
real coefficients. By definition, a real number b is an upper bound for the
zeros if no zero is greater than b. A real number a is a lower bound for the
zeros if no zero is less than a. Thus, if r is any real zero of 
, then 
;
that is, r is in the closed interval 
, as illustrated in Figure 2. Note that
upper and lower bounds are not unique, since any number greater than b is also
an upper bound and any number less than a is also a lower bound.
Figure 2
We may use synthetic division to find upper and lower bounds for the
zeros of 
. Recall that if we divide 
synthetically by 
, the third row
in the division process contains the coefficients of the quotient 
together
with the remainder 
. The following theorem indicates how this third row

We divide 
synthetically by 
and 
.
The third row of the synthetic division by 
contains negative numbers,
and hence part (1) of the theorem on bounds for real zeros of polynomials does
not apply. However, since all numbers in the third row of the synthetic division
by 
are positive, it follows from part (1) that 2 is an upper bound for the
real solutions of the equation. This fact is also evident if we express the divi-
sion by 
in the division algorithm form
for if 
, then the right-hand side of the equation is positive (why?), and
hence 
is not zero.
We now find a lower bound. After some trial-and-error attempts using

Since the numbers in the third row are alternately positive and negative, it fol-

the form
for if

hence 
is not zero.
Since lower and upper bounds for the real solutions are

Finding a polynomial from a graph
Shown in Figure 4 are all the zeros of a polynomial function f.
(a) Find a factored form for f that has minimal degree.
(b) Assuming the leading coefficient of f is 1, find the y-intercept.
SOLUT ION
(a) The zero at 
must have a multiplicity that is an even number, since
f does not change sign at 
. The zero at 
must have an odd multi-
plicity of 3 or greater, since f changes sign at 
and levels off. The zero at
is of multiplicity 1, since f changes sign and does not level off. Thus, a
factored form of f is
Because we desire the function having minimal degree, we let

which is a sixth-degree polynomial.
(b) If the leading coefficient of f is to be 1, then, from the complete factori-
zation theorem for polynomials, we know that the value of a is 1. To find the
y-intercept, we let

Hence, the y-intercept is 12.

Note that in (*) the symbol i does not appear. This is not a coincidence,
since if

also a zero and we can multiply the associated factors as follows:
In Example 1 we have 
and 
, so 
and 
and
the associated quadratic factor is 
. This resulting quadratic factor
will always have real coefficients, as stated in the next theorem.
PROOF
Since

we may write
where a is the leading coefficient of 
. Of course, some of the zeros may be
real. In such cases we obtain the linear factors referred to in the statement of
the theorem.
If a zero 
is not real, then, by the theorem on conjugate pair zeros of a
polynomial, the conjugate 
is also a zero of

the numbers 
. This implies that both 
and

the factorization of 
. If those factors are multiplied, we obtain
which has real coefficients, since 
and

is a complex zero, then the product 
is a quadratic polynomial
that is irreducible over . This completes the proof.

Finding the rational solutions of an equation
Find all rational solutions of the equation
SOLUT ION
The problem is equivalent to finding the rational zeros of the
polynomial on the left-hand side of the equation. If 
is a rational zero and
c and d have no common factor, then c is a factor of the constant term 
and
d is a factor of the leading coefficient 3. All possible choices are listed in the
following table.
We can reduce the number of choices by finding upper and lower bounds for
the real solutions; however, we shall not do so here. It is necessary to deter-
mine which of the choices for 
, if any, are zeros. We see by substitution that
neither 1 nor 
is a solution. If we divide synthetically by 
, we obtain
This result shows that 
is a zero. Moreover, the synthetic division provides
the coefficients of the quotient in the division of the polynomial by 
.
Hence, we have the following factorization of the given polynomial:
The remaining solutions of the equation must be zeros of the second factor, so
we use that polynomial to check for solutions. Do not use the polynomial in
the original equation. (Note that 
are no longer candidates, since the nu-
merator must be a factor of 4.) Again proceeding by trial and error, we ulti-
mately find that synthetic division by 
gives us the following result:
Therefore,
is also a zero.
Using the coefficients of the quotient, we know that the remaining zeros
are solutions of the equation

Finding the radius of a grain silo
A grain silo has the shape of a right circular cylinder with a hemisphere at-

SOLUT ION
Let x denote the radius of the cylinder as shown in Figure 1.
The volume of the cylinder is

hemisphere is

Since the leading coefficient of the polynomial on the left-hand side of the last
equation is 1, any rational root has the form 
, where c is a factor of
3024. If we factor 3024 into primes, we find that 
. It follows
that some of the positive factors of 3024 are
To help us decide which of these numbers to test first, let us make a rough es-
timate of the radius by assuming that the silo has the shape of a right circular
cylinder of height 30 feet. In that case, the volume would be 
.
Since this volume should be close to 
, we see that
This suggests that we use 6 in our first synthetic division, as follows:
Thus, 6 is a solution of the equation 
.
The remaining two solutions of the equation can be found by solving the
depressed equation 
. These zeros are approximately 
and 
—neither of which satisfies the conditions of the problem. Hence,
the desired radius is 6 feet.

Rational Functions and Their Domains

Previously we simplified rational expressions as follows:
if
If we let 
and 
, then the domain of f is all x except
and the domain of g is all real numbers. These domains and the above
simplification suggest that the graphs of f and g are the same except for 
.
What happens to the graph of f at 
? There is a hole in the graph—that is,
a single point is missing. To find the y-value of the hole, we can substitute 2
for x in the reduced function, which is simply 
. A graph of f is shown
in Figure 1.
We now turn our attention to rational functions that do not have a com-
mon factor in the numerator and the denominator.
When sketching the graph of a rational function f, it is important to an-
swer the following two questions.
Question 1 What can be said of the function values 
when x is close
to (but not equal to) a zero of the denominator?
Question 2 What can be said of the function values 
when x is large
positive or when x is large negative?
As we shall see, if a is a zero of the denominator, one of several situations
often occurs. These are shown in Figure 2, where we have used notations from
the following chart.

The symbols 
(read “infinity”) and 
(read “minus infinity”) do not
represent real numbers; they simply specify certain types of behavior of func-
tions and variables.
The dashed line 
in Figure 2 is called a vertical asymptote, as in the
following definition.
Thus, the answer to Question 1 is that if a is a zero of the denominator of
a rational function f, then the graph of f may have a vertical asymptote 
.
There are rational functions where this is not the case (as in Figure 1 of this
section). If the numerator and denominator have no common factor, then f
must have a vertical asymptote 
.
Let us next consider Question 2. For x large positive or large negative, the
graph of a rational function may look like one of those in Figure 3, where the
notation
is read “
approaches c as x increases without bound” or “
approaches
c as x approaches infinity,” and the notation
is read “
approaches c as x decreases without bound.”

number c when x is large positive or large negative; that is, the graph of f may
have a horizontal asymptote 
. There are rational functions where this is
not the case (as in Examples 2(c) and 9).
Note that, as in the second and fourth sketches in Figure 3, the graph of f
may cross a horizontal asymptote.
In the next example we find the asymptotes for the graph of a simple ra-
tional function.

The function considered in Example 1,

sembles one of the simplest rational functions, the reciprocal function. The
reciprocal function has equation 
, vertical asymptote 
(the 
y-axis), and horizontal asymptote 
(the x-axis). The graph of the recip-
rocal function (shown in Appendix I) is the graph of a hyperbola (discussed
later in the text). Note that we can obtain the graph of 
by shift-

2 Find the real zeros of the denominator

3 Find the y-intercept

4 Apply the theorem on horizontal asymptotes. If there is a horizontal

5 If there is a horizontal asymptote 
, determine whether it intersects
the graph. The x-coordinates of the points of intersection are the solu-
tions of the equation

6 Sketch the graph of f in each of the regions in the xy-plane determined
by the vertical asymptotes in guideline 2. If necessary, use the sign of
specific function values to tell whether the graph is above or below the 
x-axis or the horizontal asymptote. Use guideline 5 to decide whether the
graph approaches the horizontal asymptote from above or below.

To find the x-intercepts we find the zeros of the numerator. Solv-

The leading coefficients are 3 and 2, so by part (2) of the theorem on horizon-
tal asymptotes, the line

Guideline 5
The x-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the

this equation as follows:

Since 
for any value of x, this result indicates that the graph of f does
not intersect the horizontal asymptote. As an aid in sketching, we can now
think of the horizontal asymptote as a boundary that cannot be crossed.
Guideline 6
The vertical asymptote in Figure 5 divides the xy-plane into two
regions:
the region to the left of 
the region to the right of 
For

and 
that the graph of f must

To find the x-intercepts we find the zeros of the numerator. Solv-

Guideline 2
The denominator has zeros

Guideline 3
The y-intercept is

The numerator and denominator of

For

no x-intercept between

, there will be a low
point on the graph between

the horizontal asymptote 
from below. It is difficult to see where the low
point occurs in Figure 10 because the function values are very close to one 
another. Using calculus, it can be shown that the low point is 
.
In

Since the function does not cross the horizontal asymptote in this region, we

In Example 9, the graph of f approaches the line 
asymptoti-
cally as

ferent types of curves asymptotically. For example, if
then for large values of 
,
and hence 
. Thus, the graph of
f approaches the parabola 
asymptotically as

. In
general, if 
and if

Graphs of rational functions may become increasingly complicated as the
degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator increase. Tech-
niques developed in calculus are very helpful in achieving a more thorough
treatment of such graphs.
Formulas that represent physical quantities may determine rational func-
tions. For example, consider Ohm’s law in electrical theory, which states that
, where R is the resistance (in ohms) of a conductor, V is the potential
difference (in volts) across the conductor, and I is the current (in amperes) that
flows through the conductor. The resistance of certain alloys approaches zero
as the temperature approaches absolute zero (approximately 
), and the
alloy becomes a superconductor of electricity. If the voltage V is fixed, then,
for such a superconductor,
that is, as R approaches 0, the current increases without bound. Superconduc-
tors allow very large currents to be used in generating plants and motors. They
also have applications in experimental high-speed ground transportation,
where the strong magnetic fields produced by superconducting magnets en-
able trains to levitate so that there is essentially no friction between the wheels
and the track. Perhaps the most important use for superconductors is in circuits
for computers, because such circuits produce very little heat.

Variation
In some scientific investigations, the terminology of variation or proportion is
used to describe relationships between variable quantities. In the following
chart, k is a nonzero real number called a constant of variation or a constant
of proportionality.
The variable x in the chart can also represent a power. For example, the
formula 
states that the area A of a circle varies directly as the square
of the radius r, where 
is the constant of variation. Similarly, the formula
states that the volume V of a sphere is directly proportional to the
cube of the radius. In this case the constant of proportionality is 
.
In general, graphs of variables related by direct variation resemble graphs
of power functions of the form 
(such as 
or 
for nonnegative x-values, as shown in Figure 1). With direct variation, as one
variable increases, so does the other variable. An example of two quantities
that are directly related is the number of miles run and the number of calories
burned.

The following guidelines may be used to solve applied problems that in-
volve variation or proportion.
We shall follow these guidelines in the solution of the next example.

Pressure and volume as inversely proportional quantities
If the temperature remains constant, the pressure of an enclosed gas is in-
versely proportional to the volume. The pressure of a certain gas within a
spherical balloon of radius 9 inches is 
. If the radius of the balloon in-
creases to 12 inches, approximate the new pressure of the gas. Sketch a graph
of the relationship between the pressure and the volume.
SOLUT ION
Guideline 1
If we denote the pressure by P (in 
) and the volume by V
(in 
), then since P is inversely proportional to V,
for some constant of proportionality k.
Guideline 2
We find the constant of proportionality k in guideline 1. Since the
volume V of a sphere of radius r is 
, the initial volume of
the balloon is 
. This leads to the following:
when
solve for k

Guidelines for Solving 
Variation Problems
1 Write a general formula that involves the variables and a constant of
variation (or proportion) k.
2 Find the value of k in guideline 1 by using the initial data given in the
statement of the problem.
3 Substitute the value of k found in guideline 2 into the formula of guide-
line 1, obtaining a specific formula that involves the variables.
4 Use the new data to solve the problem.
(continued)
Guideline 4
If the new radius of the balloon is 12 inches, then
Substituting this number for V in the formula obtained in guideline 3 gives us
Thus, the pressure decreases to approximately 
when the radius in-
creases to 12 inches.
Figure 4 illustrates the relationship of the variables P and V for
Since 
and 
we can show that
we could also say that P is inversely proportional
to 
. Note that this is a graph of a simple rational function.
Figure 4
L
There are other types of variation. If x, y, and z are variables and 
for some real number k, we say that y varies directly as the product of x and z
or y varies jointly as x and z. If 
, then y varies directly as x and in-
versely as z. As a final illustration, if a variable w varies directly as the prod-
uct of x and the cube of y and inversely as the square of z, then

Finding the support load of a rectangular beam
The weight that can be safely supported by a beam with a rectangular cross
section varies directly as the product of the width and square of the depth of
the cross section and inversely as the length of the beam. If a 2-inch by 4-inch
beam that is 8 feet long safely supports a load of 500 pounds, what weight can
be safely supported by a 2-inch by 8-inch beam that is 10 feet long? (Assume
that the width is the shorter dimension of the cross section.)

Exponential and logarithmic functions are transcendental functions, since
they cannot be defined in terms of only addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, division, and rational powers of a variable x, as is the case for the al-
gebraic functions considered in previous chapters. Such functions are of
major importance in mathematics and have applications in almost every
field of human endeavor. They are especially useful in the fields of chem-
istry, biology, physics, and engineering, where they help describe the man-
ner in which quantities in nature grow or decay. As we shall see in this
chapter, there is a close relationship between specific exponential and loga-
rithmic functions—they are inverse functions of each other.

Functions
A function f may have the same value for different numbers in its domain. For
example, if 
, then 
and 
, but 
. For the in-
verse of a function to be defined, it is essential that different numbers in the
domain always give different values of f. Such functions are called one-to-one
functions.
The arrow diagram in Figure 1 illustrates a one-to-one function. Note that
each function value in the range R corresponds to exactly one element in the
domain D. The function illustrated in Figure 2 of Section 3.4 is not one-to-one,
since

following:
definition of 
subtract 2
divide by 3
Since we have concluded that a must equal b, f is one-to-one.
(b) Showing that a function is one-to-one requires a general proof, as in 
part (a). To show that g is not one-to-one we need only find two distinct real
numbers in the domain that produce the same function value. For example,
, but 
. In fact, since g is an even function,
for every real number a.

If we know the graph of a function f, it is easy to determine whether f is
one-to-one. For example, the function whose graph is sketched in Figure 2 is
not one-to-one, since 
, but 
. Note that the horizontal line
intersects the graph in more than one point. In general,
we may use the following graphical test to determine whether a function is
one-to-one.

SOLUT ION
(a) The graph of

We may surmise from Example 2 that every increasing function or de-
creasing function passes the horizontal line test. Hence, we obtain the follow-
ing result.
Let f be a one-to-one function with domain D and range R. Thus, for each

graph of f in at most one point.

illustrated by the arrow in Figure 5(a). We may, therefore, define a function g
from R to D by means of the following rule:
As in Figure 5(b), g reverses the correspondence given by f. We call g the in-
verse function of f, as in the next definition.

Remember that for the inverse of a function f to be defined, it is ab-
solutely essential that f be one-to-one. The following theorem, stated without
proof, is useful to verify that a function g is the inverse of f.
Conditions 1 and 2 of the preceding theorem are illustrated in Figure 6(a)
and (b), respectively, where the blue arrow indicates that f is a function from
D to R and the red arrow indicates that g is a function from R to D.

(b) First g, then f
Note that in Figure 6(a) we first apply f to the number x in D, obtaining
the function value

in D. Condition 1 of the theorem states that 
for every x;
that is, g reverses the correspondence given by f.
In Figure 6(b) we use the opposite order for the functions. We first apply

Theorem on Inverse Functions
Let f be a one-to-one function with domain D and range R. If g is a func-

in R. Condition 2 of the theorem states
that 
for every y; that is, f reverses the correspondence given by g.
If a function f has an inverse function g, we often denote g by 
. The 
used in this notation should not be mistaken for an exponent; that is,
The reciprocal 
may be denoted by 
. It is important to re-
member the following facts about the domain and range of f and 
.
When we discuss functions, we often let x denote an arbitrary number in
the domain. Thus, for the inverse function 
, we may wish to consider 
,
where x is in the domain R of
. In this event, the two conditions in the theo-
rem on inverse functions are written as follows:
(1)
(2)
Figure 6 contains a hint for finding the inverse of a one-to-one function in
certain cases: If possible, we solve the equation
for x in terms of y,
obtaining an equation of the form 
. If the two conditions 
and 
are true for every x in the domains of f and g, respectively,
then g is the required inverse function 
. The following guidelines summa-
rize this procedure; in guideline 2, in anticipation of finding 
, we write
instead of 
.
The success of this method depends on the nature of the equation 
,
since we must be able to solve for x in terms of y. For this reason, we include
the phrase in simple cases in the title of the guidelines. We shall follow these
guidelines in the next four examples.

There is an interesting relationship between the graph of a function f and
the graph of its inverse function 
. We first note that 
is equivalent
to 
. These equations imply that the point
is on the graph of f
if and only if the point
is on the graph of

As an illustration, in Example 5 we found that the functions f and
given by
are inverse functions of each other, provided that x is suitably restricted. Some
points on the graph of f are 
,
,

. Corresponding
points on the graph of

of f and 
are sketched on the same coordinate plane in Figure 9. If the page
is folded along the line 
that bisects quadrants I and III (as indicated by
the dashes in the figure), then the graphs of f and 
coincide. The two graphs
are reflections of each other through the line 
, or are symmetric with re-
spect to this line. This is typical of the graph of every function f that has an
inverse function 
(see Exercise 50).

SOLUT ION
The graph of f is sketched in Figure 10. Note that f is an odd
function, and hence the graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Guideline 1
Since f is increasing throughout its domain 
, it is one-to-one
and hence has an inverse function 
.

We consider the equation

where x is restricted to rational numbers. Recall that if 
for integers 
m and n with 
, then 
. Coordinates of several points 
on the graph of 
are listed in the following table.
Other values of y for x rational, such as 
, and 
, can be approxi-
mated with a calculator. We can show algebraically that if 
and 
are rational
numbers such that 
, then 
. Thus, f is an increasing function,
and its graph rises. Plotting points leads to the sketch in Figure 1, where the
small dots indicate that only the points with rational x-coordinates are on 
the graph. There is a hole in the graph whenever the x-coordinate of a point 
is irrational.
To extend the domain of f to all real numbers, it is necessary to define 
for every irrational exponent x. To illustrate, if we wish to define 
, we could
use the nonterminating decimal representing 3.1415926 . . . for 
and consider
the following rational powers of 2:
It can be shown, using calculus, that each successive power gets closer to a
unique real number, denoted by 
. Thus,
The same technique can be used for any other irrational power of 2. To sketch
the graph of 
with x real, we replace the holes in the graph in Figure 1
with points, and we obtain the graph in Figure 2. The function f defined by
for every real number x is called the exponential function with
base 2.
Let us next consider any base a, where a is a positive real number differ-
ent from 1. As in the preceding discussion, to each real number x there corre-
sponds exactly one positive number 
such that the laws of exponents are true.
Thus, as in the following chart, we may define a function f whose domain is 
and range is the set of positive real numbers.

The graphs in the chart show that if 
, then f is increasing on , and
if 
, then f is decreasing on . (These facts can be proved using cal-
culus.) The graphs merely indicate the general appearance—the exact shape
depends on the value of a. Note, however, that since 
, the y-intercept is
1 for every a.
If 
, then as x decreases through negative values, the graph of f ap-
proaches the x-axis (see the third column in the chart). Thus, the x-axis is a
horizontal asymptote. As x increases through positive values, the graph rises
rapidly. This type of variation is characteristic of the exponential law of
growth, and f is sometimes called a growth function.
If 
, then as x increases, the graph of f approaches the x-axis as-
ymptotically (see the last column in the chart). This type of variation is known
as exponential decay.
When considering

If

and the graph of 
is a horizontal line.
The graph of an exponential function f is either increasing throughout its
domain or decreasing throughout its domain. Thus, f is one-to-one by the
theorem on page 279. Combining this result with the definition of a one-to-one
function (see page 278) gives us parts (1) and (2) of the following theorem.
When using this theorem as a reason for a step in the solution to an ex-
ample, we will state that exponential functions are one-to-one.

Bacterial Growth
Exponential functions may be used to describe the growth of certain popula-
tions. As an illustration, suppose it is observed experimentally that the number
of bacteria in a culture doubles every day. If 1000 bacteria are present at the
start, then we obtain the following table, where t is the time in days and

Radioactive Decay
Certain physical quantities decrease exponentially. In such cases, if a is the
base of the exponential function, then 
. One of the most common
examples of exponential decrease is the decay of a radioactive substance, or
isotope. The half-life of an isotope is the time it takes for one-half the original
amount in a given sample to decay. The half-life is the principal characteristic
used to distinguish one radioactive substance from another. The polonium iso-
tope 
has a half-life of approximately 140 days; that is, given any amount,
one-half of it will disintegrate in 140 days. If 20 milligrams of 
is present
initially, then the following table indicates the amount remaining after various
intervals of time.
The sketch in Figure 10 illustrates the exponential nature of the disintegration.
Other radioactive substances have much longer half-lives. In particular, a
by-product of nuclear reactors is the radioactive plutonium isotope 
,
which has a half-life of approximately 24,000 years. It is for this reason that
the disposal of radioactive waste is a major problem in modern society.

Compound Interest
Compound interest provides a good illustration of exponential growth. If a
sum of money P, the principal, is invested at a simple interest rate r, then the
interest at the end of one interest period is the product Pr when r is expressed
as a decimal. For example, if 
and the interest rate is 9% per year,
then 
, and the interest at the end of one year is 
, or $90.
If the interest is reinvested with the principal at the end of the interest pe-
riod, then the new principal is
Note that to find the new principal we may multiply the original principal by
. In the preceding example, the new principal is 
, or $1090.
After another interest period has elapsed, the new principal may be found
by multiplying 
by 
. Thus, the principal after two interest pe-
riods is 
. If we continue to reinvest, the principal after three periods
is 
; after four it is 
; and, in general, the amount A accumu-
lated after k interest periods is

Interest accumulated by means of this formula is compound interest. Note
that A is expressed in terms of an exponential function with base 
. The
interest period may be measured in years, months, weeks, days, or any other
suitable unit of time. When applying the formula for A, remember that r is the
interest rate per interest period expressed as a decimal. For example, if the
rate is stated as 6% per year compounded monthly, then the rate per month is
or, equivalently, 0.5%. Thus,
and k is the number of months. If
$100 is invested at this rate, then the formula for A is
In general, we have the following formula.

formula.

for n interest periods per year. The values of n we wish to consider are listed
in the following table, where we have assumed that there are 365 days in a year
and hence 
hours and 
minutes. (In
many business transactions an investment year is considered to be only
360 days.)
Using the compound interest formula (and a calculator), we obtain the
amounts given in the following table.
Note that, in the preceding example, after we reach an interest period of
one hour, the number of interest periods per year has no effect on the final
amount. If interest had been compounded each second, the result would still
be $1094.17. (Some decimal places beyond the first two do change.) Thus, the
amount approaches a fixed value as n increases. Interest is said to be com-
pounded continuously if the number n of time periods per year increases
without bound.

of damaging events (the dose), then the surviving fraction

This is called the one target–one hit surviving fraction.
Suppose next that each cell has n targets and that each target must be hit
once for the cell to die. In this case, the n target–one hit surviving fraction is

A complete analysis of the graph of f requires calculus. The graph is sketched
in Figure 4. The shoulder on the curve near the point 
represents the
threshold nature of the treatment—that is, a small dose results in very little
tumor cell elimination. Note that for a large x, an increase in dosage has little
effect on the surviving fraction. To determine the ideal dose to administer to a
patient, specialists in radiation therapy must also take into account the number
of healthy cells that are killed during a treatment.

In Section 5.2 we observed that the exponential function given by 
for 
or 
is one-to-one. Hence, f has an inverse function 
(see Section 5.1). This inverse of the exponential function with base a is called
the logarithmic function with base a and is denoted by 
. Its values are
written 
or 
, read “the logarithm of x with base a.” Since, by the
definition of an inverse function 
,
the definition of 
may be expressed as follows.
Note that the two equations in the definition are equivalent. We call the
first equation the logarithmic form and the second the exponential form.You
should strive to become an expert in changing each form into the other. The
following diagram may help you achieve this goal.
Logarithmic form
Exponential form

Observe that when forms are changed, the bases of the logarithmic and
exponential forms are the same. The number y (that is,
) corresponds to
the exponent in the exponential form. In words,
is the exponent to which
the base a must be raised to obtain x. This is what people are referring to when
they say “Logarithms are exponents.”
The following illustration contains examples of equivalent forms.

and
hence is one-to-one by the theorem on page 279. Combining this result with
parts (1) and (2) of the definition of one-to-one function on page 278 gives us
the following theorem, which can also be proved if

When using this theorem as a reason for a step in the solution to an ex-
ample, we will state that logarithmic functions are one-to-one.
In the following example we solve a simple logarithmic equation—that is,
an equation involving a logarithm of an expression that contains a variable.
Extraneous solutions may be introduced when logarithmic equations are
solved. Hence, we must check solutions of logarithmic equations to make sure
that we are taking logarithms of only positive real numbers; otherwise, a loga-
rithmic function is not defined.

We will describe three methods for sketching the graph.
Method 1
Since the functions given by

Using this formula, we obtain the points on the graph listed in the following

Now on the graph of

Alternatively, we may think of this function as

sub-
stituted for x (refer to the discussion on page 180). Since all points on the
graph of g have positive x-coordinates, we can obtain the graph of f by com-

Before electronic calculators were invented, logarithms with base 10 were
used for complicated numerical computations involving products, quotients,
and powers of real numbers. Base 10 was used because it is well suited for
numbers that are expressed in scientific form. Logarithms with base 10 are
called common logarithms. The symbol 
is used as an abbreviation for
, just as 
is used as an abbreviation for

Since inexpensive calculators are now available, there is no need for com-
mon logarithms as a tool for computational work. Base 10 does occur in ap-
plications, however, and hence many calculators have a 
key, which can be
used to approximate common logarithms.

The following chart lists common and natural logarithmic forms for the
properties on page 309.
The last property for natural logarithms allows us to write the number a
as 
, so the exponential function 
can be written as 
or as 
. Many calculators compute an exponential regression model
of the form 
. If an exponential model with base e is desired, we can
write the model

Figure 9 shows four logarithm graphs with base 
. Note that for
, as the base of the logarithm increases, the graphs increase more slowly
(they are more horizontal). This makes sense when we consider the graphs of
the inverses of these functions:
,
,
, and 
. Here, for
, as the base of the exponential expression increases, the graphs increase
faster (they are more vertical).
The next four examples illustrate applications of common and natural
logarithms.

Newton’s law of cooling
Newton’s law of cooling states that the rate at which an object cools is directly
proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its sur-
rounding medium. Newton’s law can be used to show that under certain con-

Approximating a doubling time
Assume that a population is growing continuously at a rate of 4% per year. Ap-
proximate the amount of time it takes for the population to double its size—
that is, its doubling time.
SOLUT ION
Note that an initial population size is not given. Not knowing
the initial size does not present a problem, however, since we wish only to de-
termine the time needed to obtain a population size relative to the initial popu-
lation size. Using the growth formula 
with

The fact that 
did not have any effect on the answer indicates that the
doubling time for a population of 1000 is the same as the doubling time for a
population of 1,000,000 or any other reasonable initial population.
L
From the last example we may obtain a general formula for the doubling
time of a population—namely,
or, equivalently,
Since 
, we see that the doubling time t for a growth of this type is
approximately 
. Because the numbers 70 and 72 are close to 69 but have
more divisors, some resources refer to this doubling relationship as the rule of
70 or the rule of 72. As an illustration of the rule of 72, if the growth rate of a
population is 8%, then it takes about 
years for the population to 
double. More precisely, this value is

Determining the half-life of a radioactive substance
A physicist finds that an unknown radioactive substance registers 2000 counts
per minute on a Geiger counter. Ten days later the substance registers 1500
counts per minute. Using calculus, it can be shown that after t days the amount
of radioactive material, and hence the number of counts per minute 
, is di-
rectly proportional to 
for some constant c. Determine the half-life of the
substance.
SOLUT ION
Since 
is directly proportional to 
,
where k is a constant. Letting 
and using 
, we obtain
Hence, the formula for 
may be written

nential expressions with constant bases and variables appearing in the expo-
nent(s), we often equate the logarithms of both sides of the equation. When we
do so, the variables in the exponent become multipliers, and the resulting
equation is usually easier to solve. We will refer to this step as simply “take
log of both sides.”

check is to note that since

must be between 2 and 3, somewhat closer to 3 than to 2.

We could also have solved the equation in Example 1 by changing the
exponential form 
to logarithmic form, as we did in Section 5.4,
obtaining
This is, in fact, the solution of the equation; however, since calculators typi-
cally have keys only for log and ln, we cannot approximate 
directly.
The next theorem gives us a simple change of base formula for finding 
if 
and b is any logarithmic base.

The change of base formula is sometimes confused with law 2 of loga-
rithms. The first of the following warnings could be remembered with the
phrase “a quotient of logs is not the log of the quotient.”
The most frequently used special cases of the change of base formula are
those for 
(common logarithms) and 
(natural logarithms), as
stated in the next box.
Next, we will rework Example 1 using a change of base formula.

The inverse hyperbolic secant is part of the equation of the curve called a
tractrix. The curve is associated with Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz’s
(1646–1716) solution to the question “What is the path of an object dragged
along a horizontal plane by a string of constant length when the end of the
string not joined to the object moves along a straight line in the plane?”

A logistic curve is the graph of an equation of the form
where k, b, and c are positive constants. Such curves are useful for describing
a population y that grows rapidly initially, but whose growth rate decreases
after x reaches a certain value. In a famous study of the growth of protozoa by
Gause, a population of Paramecium caudata was found to be described by a
logistic equation with 
,

zone, in which photosynthesis takes place. The photic zone
ends at the depth where about 1% of the surface light pene-
trates. In very clear waters in the Caribbean, 50% of the
light at the surface reaches a depth of about 13 meters. Es-
timate the depth of the photic zone.
54 Photic zone In contrast to the situation described in the pre-
vious exercise, in parts of New York harbor, 50% of the sur-
face light does not reach a depth of 10 centimeters. Estimate
the depth of the photic zone.

7 Salary increases Suppose you started a job at $40,000 per
year. In 5 years, you are scheduled to be making $60,000
per year. Determine the annual exponential rate of increase
that describes this situation. Assume that the same ex-
ponential rate of increase will continue for 40 years. Using
the rule of 70 (page 317), mentally estimate your annual
salary in 40 years, and compare the estimate to an actual
computation.
8 Energy release Consider these three events:
(1) On May 18, 1980, the volcanic eruption of Mount
St. Helens in Washington released approximately
of energy.
(2) When a 1-megaton nuclear bomb detonates, it releases
about 
of energy.
(3) The 1989 San Francisco earthquake registered 7.1 on
the Richter scale.
(a) Make some comparisons (i.e., how many of one event
is equivalent to another) in terms of energy released.
(Hint: Refer to Exercise 70 in Chapter 5 Review Ex-
ercises.) Note: The atomic bombs dropped in World
War II were 1-kiloton bombs (1000 1-kiloton
bombs
1 1-megaton bomb).
(b) What reading on the Richter scale would be equivalent
to the Mount St. Helens eruption? Has there ever been
a reading that high?

Trigonometry was invented over 2000 years ago by the Greeks, who needed
precise methods for measuring angles and sides of triangles. In fact, the
word trigonometry was derived from the two Greek words trigonon (trian-
gle) and metria (measurement). This chapter begins with a discussion of an-
gles and how they are measured. We next introduce the trigonometric
functions by using ratios of sides of a right triangle. After extending the do-
mains of the trigonometric functions to arbitrary angles and real numbers,
we consider their graphs and graphing techniques that make use of ampli-
tudes, periods, and phase shifts. The chapter concludes with a section on ap-
plied problems.

Applied Problems
In geometry an angle is defined as the set of points determined by two rays,
or half-lines,
and , having the same endpoint O. If A and B are points on 
and , as in Figure 1, we refer to angle AOB (denoted 
). An angle may
also be considered as two finite line segments with a common endpoint.
In trigonometry we often interpret angles as rotations of rays. Start with a
fixed ray , having endpoint O, and rotate it about O, in a plane, to a position
specified by ray . We call 
the initial side,
the terminal side, and O the
vertex of 
. The amount or direction of rotation is not restricted in any
way. We might let 
make several revolutions in either direction about O be-
fore coming to position , as illustrated by the curved arrows in Figure 2.
Thus, many different angles have the same initial and terminal sides. Any two
such angles are called coterminal angles. A straight angle is an angle whose
sides lie on the same straight line but extend in opposite directions from its
vertex.
If we introduce a rectangular coordinate system, then the standard posi-
tion of an angle is obtained by taking the vertex at the origin and letting the
initial side 
coincide with the positive x-axis. If 
is rotated in a counter-
clockwise direction to the terminal position , then the angle is considered
positive. If 
is rotated in a clockwise direction, the angle is negative. We
often denote angles by lowercase Greek letters such as 
(alpha),
(beta),
(gamma),
(theta),
(phi), and so on. Figure 3 contains sketches of two posi-
tive angles,
and , and a negative angle,
. If the terminal side of an angle
in standard position is in a certain quadrant, we say that the angle is in that
quadrant. In Figure 3,
is in quadrant III,
is in quadrant I, and 
is in quad-
rant II. An angle is called a quadrantal angle if its terminal side lies on a co-
ordinate axis.
Figure 3
Standard position of an angle
One unit of measurement for angles is the degree. The angle in standard po-
sition obtained by one complete revolution in the counterclockwise direction has
measure 360 degrees, written 360°. Thus, an angle of measure 1 degree (1°) 
is obtained by 
of one complete counterclockwise revolution. In Figure 4,
several angles measured in degrees are shown in standard position on rectan-
gular coordinate systems. Note that the first three are quadrantal angles.

A right angle is half of a straight angle and has measure 90°. The fol-
lowing chart contains definitions of other special types of angles.
If smaller measurements than the degree are required, we can use tenths,
hundredths, or thousandths of degrees. Alternatively, we can divide the degree
into 60 equal parts, called minutes (denoted by ), and each minute into 60
equal parts, called seconds (denoted by ). Thus,

Degree measure for angles is used in applied areas such as surveying, navi-
gation, and the design of mechanical equipment. In scientific applications that
require calculus, it is customary to employ radian measure. To define an angle
of radian measure 1, we consider a circle of any radius r. A central angle of a
circle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. If 
is the central
angle shown in Figure 6, we say that the arc AP (denoted 
) of the circle
subtends
or that 
is subtended by
. If the length of 
is equal to the
radius r of the circle, then has a measure of one radian, as in the next definition.

Definition of Radian Measure
One radian is the measure of the central angle of a circle subtended by an
arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.

If we consider a circle of radius r, then an angle 
whose measure is 1 ra-
dian intercepts an arc AP of length r, as illustrated in Figure 7(a). The angle 
in Figure 7(b) has radian measure 2, since it is subtended by an arc of length
. Similarly,
in (c) of the figure has radian measure 3, since it is subtended
by an arc of length 
.
To find the radian measure corresponding to 360°, we must find the num-
ber of times that a circular arc of length r can be laid off along the circumfer-
ence (see Figure 7(d)). This number is not an integer or even a rational number.
Since the circumference of the circle is 
, the number of times r units can be
laid off is 
. Thus, an angle of measure 
radians corresponds to the de-
gree measure 360°, and we write 
radians. This result gives us the
following relationships.
When radian measure of an angle is used, no units will be indicated. Thus,
if an angle has radian measure 5, we write 
instead of 
radians.
There should be no confusion as to whether radian or degree measure is being
used, since if has degree measure 5°, we write 
, and not

The angular speed of a wheel that is rotating at a constant rate is the
angle generated in one unit of time by a line segment from the center of the
wheel to a point P on the circumference (see Figure 12). The linear speed of
a point P on the circumference is the distance that P travels per unit of time.
By dividing both sides of the formula for a circular arc by time t, we obtain a
relationship for linear speed and angular speed; that is,

SOLUT ION
(a) Let O denote the center of the wheel, and let P be a point on the circum-
ference. Because the number of revolutions per minute is 800 and because
each revolution generates an angle of 
radians, the angle generated by the
line segment OP in one minute has radian measure 
; that is,
Note that the diameter of the wheel is irrelevant in finding the angular speed.
(b)
Converting in./min to mi/hr, we get
Unlike the angular speed, the linear speed is dependent on the diameter of the
wheel.

We shall introduce the trigonometric functions in the manner in which they
originated historically—as ratios of sides of a right triangle. A triangle is a
right triangle if one of its angles is a right angle. If 
is any acute angle, we
may consider a right triangle having 
as one of its angles, as in Figure 1,

where the symbol 
specifies the 90° angle. Six ratios can be obtained using
the lengths a, b, and c of the sides of the triangle:
We can show that these ratios depend only on , and not on the size of the trian-
gle, as indicated in Figure 2. Since the two triangles have equal angles, they are
similar, and therefore ratios of corresponding sides are proportional. For example,
Thus, for each , the six ratios are uniquely determined and hence are func-
tions of . They are called the trigonometric functions* and are designated
as the sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions, ab-
breviated sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and csc, respectively. The symbol sin
, or
sin , is used for the ratio 
, which the sine function associates with . Val-
ues of the other five functions are denoted in similar fashion. To summarize, if
is the acute angle of the right triangle in Figure 1, then, by definition,
The domain of each of the six trigonometric functions is the set of all
acute angles. Later in this section we will extend the domains to larger sets of
angles, and in the next section, to real numbers.
If is the angle in Figure 1, we refer to the sides of the triangle of lengths
a, b, and c as the adjacent side, opposite side, and hypotenuse, respectively.
We shall use adj, opp, and hyp to denote the lengths of the sides. We may then
represent the triangle as in Figure 3. With this notation, the trigonometric func-
tions may be expressed as follows.
The formulas in the preceding definition can be applied to any right triangle
without attaching the labels a, b, c to the sides. Since the lengths of the sides
of a triangle are positive real numbers, the values of the six trigonometric func-
tions are positive for every acute angle . Moreover, the hypotenuse is always
greater than the adjacent or opposite side, and hence 
,
,
, and 
for every acute angle .

SOLUT ION
Consider an equilateral triangle with sides of length 2. The me-
dian from one vertex to the opposite side bisects the angle at that vertex, as 
illustrated by the dashes in Figure 5. By the Pythagorean theorem, the side op-
posite 60° in the shaded right triangle has length 
. Using the formulas for
the trigonometric functions of an acute angle of a right triangle, we obtain the
values corresponding to 60° and 30° as follows:
(a)
(b)
(c) To find the values for 
, we may consider an isosceles right triangle
whose two equal sides have length 1, as illustrated in Figure 6. By the
Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse is 
. Hence, the values
corresponding to 45° are as follows:
L
For reference, we list the values found in Example 2, together with the ra-
dian measures of the angles, in the following table. Two reasons for stressing
these values are that they are exact and that they occur frequently in work in-
volving trigonometry. Because of the importance of these special values, it is
a good idea either to memorize the table or to learn to find the values quickly
by using triangles, as in Example 2.

acute angles. Additional applications involving right triangles will be consid-

Finding the height of a flagpole
A surveyor observes that at a point A, located on level ground a distance 25.0 feet
from the base B of a flagpole, the angle between the ground and the top of the
pole is 30°. Approximate the height h of the pole to the nearest tenth of a foot.
SOLUT ION
Referring to Figure 7, we see that we want to relate the oppo-
site side and the adjacent side, h and 25, respectively, to the 30° angle. This
suggests that we use a trigonometric function involving those two sides—
namely, tan or cot. It is usually easier to solve the problem if we select the
function for which the variable is in the numerator. Hence, we have
We use the value of tan 30° from Example 2 to find h:
L
It is possible to approximate, to any degree of accuracy, the values of the
trigonometric functions for any acute angle. Calculators have keys labeled
,
, and 
that can be used to approximate values of these functions.
The values of csc, sec, and cot may then be found by means of the reciprocal
key. Before using a calculator to find function values that correspond to the
radian measure of an acute angle, be sure that the calculator is in radian
mode. For values corresponding to degree measure, select degree mode.

obtain a decimal approximation to

four decimal places.

The formulas listed in the box on the next page are, without doubt, the most
important identities in trigonometry, because they can be used to simplify and
unify many different aspects of the subject. Since the formulas are part of the
foundation for work in trigonometry, they are called the fundamental identities.
Three of the fundamental identities involve squares, such as 
and
. In general, if n is an integer different from

is written 
. The symbols 
and 
are reserved for in-
verse trigonometric functions, which we will discuss in Section 6.4 and treat
thoroughly in the next chapter. With this agreement on notation, we have, for
example,
Let us next list all the fundamental identities and then discuss the proofs.
These identities are true for every acute angle , and 
may take on various
forms. For example, using the first Pythagorean identity with 
, we
know that
We shall see later that these identities are also true for other angles and for real

Fundamental identities are often used to simplify expressions involving
trigonometric functions, as illustrated in the next example.
E X A M P L E  5
Showing that an equation is an identity
Show that the following equation is an identity by transforming the left-hand
side into the right-hand side:
SOLUT ION
We begin with the left-hand side and proceed as follows:
There are other ways to simplify the expression on the left-hand side in
Example 5. We could first multiply the two factors and then simplify and com-
bine terms. The method we employed—changing all expressions to expres-
sions that involve only sines and cosines—is often useful. However, that
technique does not always lead to the shortest possible simplification.
Hereafter, we shall use the phrase verify an identity instead of show that
an equation is an identity. When verifying an identity, we often use funda-
mental identities and algebraic manipulations to simplify expressions, as we
did in the preceding example. As with the fundamental identities, we under-
stand that an identity that contains fractions is valid for all values of the vari-
ables such that no denominator is zero.

In Section 7.1 we will verify many other identities using methods similar

Since many applied problems involve angles that are not acute, it is nec-
essary to extend the definition of the trigonometric functions. We make this
extension by using the standard position of an angle 
on a rectangular
coordinate system. If is acute, we have the situation illustrated in Figure 11,
where we have chosen a point

We now wish to consider angles of the types illustrated in Figure 12 on
the next page (or any other angle, either positive, negative, or zero). Note that
in Figure 12 the value of x or y may be negative. In each case, side QP (opp in
Figure 12) has length 
, side OQ (adj in Figure 12) has length 
, and the
hypotenuse OP has length r. We shall define the six trigonometric functions so
that their values agree with those given previously whenever the angle is acute.
It is understood that if a zero denominator occurs, then the corresponding
function value is undefined.

The domain of each trigonometric function we have discussed is a set of 
angles. In calculus and in many applications, domains of functions consist of
real numbers. To regard the domain of a trigonometric function as a subset
of , we may use the following definition.
Using this definition, we may interpret a notation such as sin 2 as either the
sine of the real number 2 or the sine of an angle of 2 radians. As in Section 6.2,
if degree measure is used, we shall write sin 2°. With this understanding,
sin 2  sin 2°.
6.3
Trigonometric Functions
of Real Numbers
Definition of the Trigonometric
Functions of Real Numbers
The value of a trigonometric function at a real number t is its value at
an angle of t radians, provided that value exists.
376
C H A P T E R  6  T H E  T R I G O N O M E T R I C  F U N C T I O N S
To find the values of trigonometric functions of real numbers with a calcula-
tor, we use the radian mode.
We may interpret trigonometric functions of real numbers geometrically
by using a unit circle U—that is, a circle of radius 1, with center at the origin
O of a rectangular coordinate plane. The circle U is the graph of the equation
. Let t be a real number such that 
, and let denote the
angle (in standard position) of radian measure t. One possibility is illustrated
in Figure 1, where 
is the point of intersection of the terminal side of 
and the unit circle U and where s is the length of the circular arc from 
to 
. Using the formula 
for the length of a circular arc, with 
and 
, we see that
Thus, t may be regarded either as the radian measure of the angle
or as the
length of the circular arc AP on U.
Next consider any nonnegative real number t. If we regard the angle 
of
radian measure t as having been generated by rotating the line segment OA
about O in the counterclockwise direction, then t is the distance along U that
A travels before reaching its final position 
. In Figure 2 we have illus-
trated a case for 
; however, if 
, then A may travel around U sev-
eral times in a counterclockwise direction before reaching 
.
If 
, then the rotation of OA is in the clockwise direction, and the dis-
tance A travels before reaching 
is 
, as illustrated in Figure 3.
The preceding discussion indicates how we may associate with each real
number t a unique point
on U. We shall call 
the point on the
unit circle U that corresponds to t. The coordinates 
of P may be used
to find the six trigonometric functions of t. Thus, by the definition of the

If we let t increase from 0 to

serving the variation of the x- and y-coordinates of P, we obtain the next table.
The notation

over, sin t takes on every value between 0 and 1. If t increases from

If t increases from

The repetitive variation of the sine and cosine functions is periodic in the sense
of the following definition.
You already have a common-sense grasp of the concept of the period of a
function. For example, if you were asked on a Monday “What day of the week
will it be in 15 days?” your response would be “Tuesday” due to your under-
standing that the days of the week repeat every 7 days and 15 is one day more

for every t in the domain of f. The least such positive real number k, if it
exists, is the period of f.

than two complete periods of 7 days. From the discussion preceding the pre-
vious theorem, we see that the period of the sine and cosine functions is 
.
We may now readily obtain the graphs of the sine and cosine functions.
Since we wish to sketch these graphs on an xy-plane, let us replace the vari-
able t by x and consider the equations
We may think of x as the radian measure of any angle; however, in calculus, x
is usually regarded as a real number. These are equivalent points of view, since
the sine (or cosine) of an angle of x radians is the same as the sine (or cosine)
of the real number x. The variable y denotes the function value that corre-
sponds to x.
The table in the margin lists coordinates of several points on the graph of
for 
. Additional points can be determined using results
on special angles, such as
To sketch the graph for 
, we plot the points given by the table
and remember that sin x increases on 
, decreases on 
and
, and increases on 
. This gives us the sketch in Figure 8.
Since the sine function is periodic, the pattern shown in Figure 8 is repeated to
the right and to the left, in intervals of length 
. This gives us the sketch in
Figure 9.

We can use the same procedure to sketch the graph of 
. The table
in the margin lists coordinates of several points on the graph for 
.
Plotting these points leads to the part of the graph shown in Figure 10. Re-
peating this pattern to the right and to the left, in intervals of length 
, we ob-
tain the sketch in Figure 11.

Figure 11
The part of the graph of the sine or cosine function corresponding to
is one cycle. We sometimes refer to a cycle as a sine wave or a
cosine wave.
The range of the sine and cosine functions consists of all real numbers
in the closed interval 
. Since 
and 
, it
follows that the range of the cosecant and secant functions consists of all real
numbers having absolute value greater than or equal to 1.
As we shall see, the range of the tangent and cotangent functions consists
of all real numbers.
Before discussing graphs of the other trigonometric functions, let us es-
tablish formulas that involve functions of 
for any t. Since a minus sign is
involved, we call them formulas for negatives.

By the preceding theorem, the tangent function is odd, and hence the
graph of 
is symmetric with respect to the origin. The table in the
margin lists some points on the graph if 
. The corresponding
points are plotted in Figure 15. The values of tan x near 
require
special attention. If we consider 
, then as x increases to-
ward 
, the numerator sin x approaches 1 and the denominator cos x ap-
proaches 0. Consequently, tan x takes on large positive values. Following are some
approximations of tan x for x close to 
:
Notice how rapidly tan x increases as x approaches 
. We say that tan x in-
creases without bound as x approaches 
through values less than 
.
Similarly, if x approaches 
through values greater than 
, then tan x
decreases without bound. We may denote this variation using the notation in-
troduced for rational functions in Section 4.5:
This variation of tan x in the open interval 
is illustrated in Fig-
ure 16. This portion of the graph is called one branch of the tangent. The lines
and 
are vertical asymptotes for the graph. The same pat-
tern is repeated in the open intervals 
,
, and
and in similar intervals of length , as shown in the figure. Thus,
the tangent function is periodic with period .

We may use the graphs of 
,
, and 
to help
sketch the graphs of the remaining three trigonometric functions. For exam-
ple, since 
, we may find the y-coordinate of a point on the
graph of the cosecant function by taking the reciprocal of the corresponding 
y-coordinate on the sine graph for every value of x except 
for any in-
teger n. (If 
,
, and hence 
is undefined.) As an aid to
sketching the graph of the cosecant function, it is convenient to sketch the
graph of the sine function (shown in red in Figure 17) and then take recipro-
cals to obtain points on the cosecant graph.
Figure 17
,
Notice the manner in which the cosecant function increases or decreases
without bound as x approaches 
for any integer n. The graph has vertical
asymptotes 
, as indicated in the figure. There is one upper branch of
the cosecant on the interval 
and one lower branch on the interval
—together they compose one cycle of the cosecant.
Since 
and 
, we may obtain the graphs of
the secant and cotangent functions by taking reciprocals of y-coordinates of
points on the graphs of the cosine and tangent functions, as illustrated in Fig-
ures 18 and 19.

We have now discussed two different approaches to the trigonometric
functions. The development in terms of angles and ratios, introduced in Sec-
tion 6.2, has many applications in the sciences and engineering. The definition
in terms of a unit circle, considered in this section, emphasizes the fact that the
trigonometric functions have domains consisting of real numbers. Such func-
tions are the building blocks for calculus. In addition, the unit circle approach
is useful for discussing graphs and deriving trigonometric identities. You
should work to become proficient in the use of both formulations of the
trigonometric functions, since each will reinforce the other and thus facilitate
your mastery of more advanced aspects of trigonometry.

In previous sections we calculated special values of the trigonometric func-
tions by using the definition of the trigonometric functions in terms of either
an angle or a unit circle. In practice we most often use a calculator to approxi-
mate function values.
We will next show how the value of any trigonometric function at an angle
of 
degrees or at a real number t can be found from its value in the
-interval 
or the t-interval 
, respectively. This technique is
sometimes necessary when a calculator is used to find all angles or real num-
bers that correspond to a given function value.
We shall make use of the following concept.
Figure 1 illustrates the reference angle 
for a nonquadrantal angle ,
with 
or 
, in each of the four quadrants.
The formulas below the axes in Figure 1 may be used to find the degree
or radian measure of 
when 
is in degrees or radians, respectively. For a
nonquadrantal angle greater than 360° or less than 0°, first find the cotermi-
nal angle with 
or 
, and then use the formulas in
Figure 1.

If we use a calculator to approximate function values, reference angles are
usually unnecessary. As an illustration, to find sin 210°, we place the calcula-
tor in degree mode and obtain 
, which is the exact value.
Using the same procedure for 240°, we obtain a decimal representation:
A calculator should not be used to find the exact value of sin 240°. In this case,
we find the reference angle 60° of 240° and use the theorem on reference an-
gles, together with known results about special angles, to obtain
Let us next consider the problem of solving an equation of the follow-

Most calculators have a key labeled 
that can be used to help solve the

keystroke sequence such as

of a function

The notation 
is based on the inverse trigonometric functions discussed

As indicated, when finding an angle, we will usually round off degree measure

39 Thickness of the ozone layer The thickness of the ozone
layer can be estimated using the formula
where 
is the intensity of a particular wavelength of light
from the sun before it reaches the atmosphere, I is the in-
tensity of the same wavelength after passing through a layer
of ozone x centimeters thick, k is the absorption constant of
ozone for that wavelength, and 
is the acute angle that the
sunlight makes with the vertical. Suppose that for a wave-

41 Solar radiation The amount of sunshine illuminating a wall

angle that the sun makes with the horizontal, and

cated at

what is the new location of the hand?
44 Robot’s arm Suppose the robot’s arm in Exercise 43 can
change its length in addition to rotating about the origin. If
the hand is initially at

degrees should the arm be rotated and how much should its
length be changed to move the hand to

The equation is of the form

By part (2) of the theorem on amplitudes, periods, and phase shifts, the
phase shift and an interval containing one sine wave can be found by solving
the following inequality:
subtract
divide by 2
Thus, the phase shift is 
, and one sine wave of amplitude 3 occurs on the
interval 
. Sketching that wave and then repeating it to the right

By part (2) of the theorem on amplitudes, periods, and phase shifts, the

If we solve the inequality
we obtain the interval

Finding an equation for a sine wave
Express the equation for the sine wave shown in Figure 12 in the form
for 
,
, and the least positive real number c.
Figure 12
SOLUT ION
The largest and smallest y-coordinates of points on the graph
are 5 and 
, respectively. Hence, the amplitude is 
.
Since one sine wave occurs on the interval 
, the period has value
. Hence, by the theorem on amplitudes, periods, and phase
shifts (with 
),
The phase shift is 
. Since c is to be positive, the phase
shift must be negative; that is, the graph in Figure 12 must be obtained by
shifting the graph of 
to the left. Since we want c to be as
small as possible, we choose the phase shift 
. Hence,
Thus, the desired equation is

There are many other equations for the graph. For example, we could use
the phase shifts 
,
,
, and so on, but these would not give us the least
positive value for c. Two other equations for the graph are
However, neither of these equations satisfies the given criteria for a, b, and c,
since in the first,
, and in the second,
and c does not have its least
positive value.
As an alternative solution, we could write
As before, we find 
and 
. Now since the graph has an x-intercept
at

to the left by 1 unit—that is, replace x with

Many phenomena that occur in nature vary in a cyclic or rhythmic man-
ner. It is sometimes possible to represent such behavior by means of trigono-
metric functions, as illustrated in the next two examples.

Analyzing the process of breathing
The rhythmic process of breathing consists of alternating periods of inhaling
and exhaling. One complete cycle normally takes place every 5 seconds. If 
denotes the air flow rate at time t (in liters per second) and if the maximum
flow rate is 0.6 liter per second, find a formula of the form 
that
fits this information.
SOLUT ION
If 
for some 
, then the period of F is 
.
In this application the period is 5 seconds, and hence
Since the maximum flow rate corresponds to the amplitude a of F, we let

Hence, one sine wave occurs on the interval

into four equal parts, we obtain the following table of values, which indicates
the familiar sine wave pattern of amplitude 3.

Methods we developed in Section 6.5 for the sine and cosine can be applied to
the other four trigonometric functions; however, there are several differences.
Since the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions have no largest
values, the notion of amplitude has no meaning. Moreover, we do not refer to
cycles. For some tangent and cotangent graphs, we begin by sketching the por-
tion between successive vertical asymptotes and then repeat that pattern to the
right and to the left.
The graph of

pressing the graph of

, then we also use a reflection about
the x-axis. Since the tangent function has period , it is sufficient to sketch the

We have used three separate graphs for clarity. In practice, we could sketch
the graphs successively on one coordinate plane.
L
Mathematical applications often involve a function f that is a sum of two
or more other functions. To illustrate, suppose
where f, g, and h have the same domain D. A technique known as addition of
y-coordinates is sometimes used to sketch the graph of f. The method is illus-
trated in Figure 9, where for each 
, the y-coordinate 
of a point on the
graph of f is the sum
of the y-coordinates of points on the graphs
of g and h. The graph of f is obtained by graphically adding a sufficient num-
ber of such y-coordinates.
It is sometimes useful to compare the graph of a sum of functions with the
individual functions, as illustrated in the next example.

The graph of an equation of the form
where f is a function and a and b are real numbers, is called a damped sine
wave or damped cosine wave, respectively, and 
is called the damping
factor. The next example illustrates a method for graphing such equations.

SOLUT ION
We first examine the absolute value of f:
absolute value of both sides
The last inequality implies that the graph of f lies between the graphs of 
the equations 
and 
. The graph of f will coincide with 
one of these graphs if 
—that is, if 
for some inte-
ger n.
Since 
, the x-intercepts on the graph of f occur at 
—that
is, at 
. Because there are an infinite number of x-intercepts, this is 
an example of a function that intersects its horizontal asymptote an infinite
number of times. With this information, we obtain the sketch shown in 
Figure 11.
L
The damping factor in Example 8 is 
. By using different damping fac-
tors, we can obtain other compressed or expanded variations of sine waves.
The analysis of such graphs is important in physics and engineering.

Trigonometry was developed to help solve problems involving angles and
lengths of sides of triangles. Problems of that type are no longer the most im-
portant applications; however, questions about triangles still arise in physical
situations. When considering such questions in this section, we shall restrict
our discussion to right triangles. Triangles that do not contain a right angle will
be considered in Chapter 8.
We shall often use the following notation. The vertices of a triangle will
be denoted by A, B, and C; the angles at A, B, and C will be denoted by ,
,
and , respectively; and the lengths of the sides opposite these angles by a, b,
and c, respectively. The triangle itself will be referred to as triangle ABC (or
denoted 
). If a triangle is a right triangle and if one of the acute 
angles and a side are known or if two sides are given, then we may find the 
remaining parts by using the formulas in Section 6.2 that express the trigono-
metric functions as ratios of sides of a triangle. We can refer to the process of
finding the remaining parts as solving the triangle.

L
As illustrated in Example 1, when working with triangles, we usually
round off answers. One reason for doing so is that in most applications the
lengths of sides of triangles and measures of angles are found by mechanical
devices and hence are only approximations to the exact values. Consequently,
a number such as 10.5 in Example 1 is assumed to have been rounded off to
the nearest tenth. We cannot expect more accuracy in the calculated values for
the remaining sides, and therefore they should also be rounded off to the near-
est tenth.
In finding angles, answers should be rounded off as indicated in the fol-
lowing table.

As illustrated in Figure 3, if an observer at point X sights an object, then
the angle that the line of sight makes with the horizontal line l is the angle of
elevation of the object, if the object is above the horizontal line, or the angle
of depression of the object, if the object is below the horizontal line. We use
this terminology in the next two examples.

Using angles of depression
From the top of a building that overlooks an ocean, an observer watches a boat

In certain navigation or surveying problems, the direction, or bearing,
from a point P to a point Q is specified by stating the acute angle that segment
PQ makes with the north-south line through P. We also state whether Q is
north or south and east or west of P. Figure 6 illustrates four possibilities. The
bearing from P to 
is 25° east of north and is denoted by N25°E. We also
refer to the direction N25°E, meaning the direction from P to 
. The bear-
ings from P to 
, to 
, and to 
are represented in a similar manner in the
figure. Note that when this notation is used for bearings or directions, N or S
always appears to the left of the angle and W or E to the right.

In air navigation, directions and bearings are specified by measuring from
the north in a clockwise direction. In this case, a positive measure is assigned
to the angle instead of the negative measure to which we are accustomed for
clockwise rotations. Referring to Figure 7, we see that the direction of PQ is
40° and the direction of PR is 300°.

Using bearings
Two ships leave port at the same time, one ship sailing in the direction N23°E at
a speed of 11 mi hr and the second ship sailing in the direction S67°E at
15 mi hr. Approximate the bearing from the second ship to the first, one hour
later.
SOLUT ION
The sketch in Figure 8 indicates the positions of the first and
second ships at points A and B, respectively, after one hour. Point C represents
the port. We wish to find the bearing from B to A. Note that
and hence triangle ACB is a right triangle. Thus,
solve for ; approximate
We have rounded 
to the nearest degree because the sides of the triangles are
given with two significant figures.
Referring to Figure 9, we obtain the following:
Thus, the bearing from B to A is approximately N31°W.

Trigonometric functions are useful in the investigation of vibratory or os-
cillatory motion, such as the motion of a particle in a vibrating guitar string or
a spring that has been compressed or elongated and then released to oscillate
back and forth. The fundamental type of particle displacement in these illus-
trations is harmonic motion.

Definition of 
Simple Harmonic Motion

In the preceding definition, the amplitude of the motion is the maximum
displacement 
of the point from the origin. The period is the time 
required for one complete oscillation. The reciprocal of the period,
, is
the number of oscillations per unit of time and is called the frequency.
A physical interpretation of simple harmonic motion can be obtained by
considering a spring with an attached weight that is oscillating vertically rela-
tive to a coordinate line, as illustrated in Figure 10. The number d represents
the coordinate of a fixed point Q in the weight, and we assume that the ampli-
tude a of the motion is constant. In this case no frictional force is retarding the
motion. If friction is present, then the amplitude decreases with time, and the
motion is said to be damped.
E X A M P L E  6
Describing harmonic motion
Suppose that the oscillation of the weight shown in Figure 10 is given by
with t measured in seconds and d in centimeters. Discuss the motion of 
the weight.
SOLUT ION
By definition, the motion is simple harmonic with amplitude
. Since 
, we obtain the following:
Thus, in 12 seconds the weight makes one complete oscillation. The frequency
is , which means that one-twelfth of an oscillation takes place each second.
The following table indicates the position of Q at various times.
The initial position of Q is 10 centimeters above the origin O. It moves
downward, gaining speed until it reaches O. Note that Q travels approximately
cm during the first second,
cm during the next
second, and 
cm during the third second. It then slows down until it
reaches a point 10 centimeters below O at the end of 6 seconds. The direction
of motion is then reversed, and the weight moves upward, gaining speed until
it reaches O. Once it reaches O, it slows down until it returns to its original po-
sition at the end of 12 seconds. The direction of motion is then reversed again,
and the same pattern is repeated indefinitely.

In advanced mathematics, the natural sciences, and engineering, it is some-
times necessary to simplify complicated trigonometric expressions and to
solve equations that involve trigonometric functions. These topics are dis-
cussed in the first two sections of this chapter. We then derive many useful
formulas with respect to sums, differences, and multiples; for reference they
are listed on the inside back cover of the text. In addition to formal manip-
ulations, we also consider numerous applications of these formulas. The last
section contains the definitions and properties of the inverse trigonometric
functions.

Trigonometric Expressions
We assume that the domain of each variable in a trigonometric expression
is the set of real numbers or angles for which the expression is meaningful. To
provide manipulative practice in simplifying complicated trigonometric ex-
pressions, we shall use the fundamental identities (see page 364) and algebraic
manipulations, as we did in Examples 5 and 6 of Section 6.2. In the first three
examples our method consists of transforming the left-hand side of a given
identity into the right-hand side, or vice versa.

Since the denominator of the left-hand side is a binomial and the
denominator of the right-hand side is a monomial, we change the form of the
fraction on the left-hand side by multiplying the numerator and denominator by
the conjugate of the denominator and then use one of the Pythagorean identities:

Another technique for showing that an equation 
is an identity is to
begin by transforming the left-hand side p into another expression s, making
sure that each step is reversible—that is, making sure it is possible to trans-
form s back into p by reversing the procedure used in each step. In this case,
the equation 
is an identity. Next, as a separate exercise, we show that
the right-hand side q can also be transformed into the expression s by means
of reversible steps and, therefore, that 
is an identity. It then follows that
is an identity. This method is illustrated in the next example.

We shall verify the identity by showing that each side of the
equation can be transformed into the same expression. First we work only with
the left-hand side:
square expression
tangent and reciprocal identities
equivalent expression
add fractions
At this point it may not be obvious how we can obtain the right-hand side
of the given equation from the last expression. Thus, we next work with only
the right-hand side and try to obtain the last expression. Multiplying numerator
and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator gives us the following:
property of quotients
The last expression is the same as that obtained from 
Since
all steps are reversible, the given equation is an identity.

Showing that an equation is not an identity
Show that cot 
is not an identity.
SOLUT ION
We only need to find one value of x that makes each side of the
equation have a different value. We could try random values of x, but investi-
gating a known identity may help us with our choice of a value for x.
A Pythagorean identity,
, relates the cot and csc func-
tions. Solving the identity for cot x, we get 
and then
. The 
symbol is the key—any value of x that
makes cot x negative will show that the given equation is not an identity.
Specifically, since cot is negative in quadrants II and IV, we’ll pick 
for
our value of x. The left-hand side is then 
and the right-hand
side is
.
The sides are not equal, so the given equation is not an identity.

A trigonometric equation is an equation that contains trigonometric expres-
sions. Each identity considered in the preceding section is an example of a
trigonometric equation with every number (or angle) in the domain of the vari-
able a solution of the equation. If a trigonometric equation is not an identity,
we often find solutions by using techniques similar to those used for algebraic
equations. The main difference is that we first solve the trigonometric equation
for 
and so on, and then find values of x or 	 that satisfy the equa-
tion. Solutions may be expressed either as real numbers or as angles. Through-
out our work we shall use the following rule: If degree measure is not 
specified, then solutions of a trigonometric equation should be expressed in
radian measure (or as real numbers). If solutions in degree measure are de-
sired, an appropriate statement will be included in the example or exercise.

In this section we derive formulas that involve trigonometric functions of 
or 
for any real numbers or angles u and v. These formulas are known as
addition and subtraction formulas, respectively, or as sum and difference iden-
tities. The first formula that we will consider may be stated as follows.
PROOF
Let u and v be any real numbers, and consider angles of radian
measure u and v. Let 
Figure 1 illustrates one possibility with the
angles in standard position. For convenience we have assumed that both u and
v are positive and that 
As in Figure 2, let 
and 
be the points on the
terminal sides of the indicated angles that are each a distance 1 from the ori-
gin. In this case P, Q, and R are on the unit circle U with center at the origin.
From the definition of trigonometric functions in terms of a unit circle,

(continued)
We next observe that the distance between 
and R must equal the
distance between Q and P, because angles AOR and QOP have the same mea-
sure,
Using the distance formula yields
Squaring both sides and simplifying the expressions under the radicals gives us
Since the points 
and 
are on the unit circle U and since
an equation for U is 
we may substitute 1 for each of 
and 
Doing this and simplifying, we obtain
which reduces to
Substituting from the formulas stated in (∗) gives us
which is what we wished to prove. It is possible to extend our discussion to all
values of u and v.

ing the exact value of

Using an addition formula

We apply the addition formula for cosine:
L
We refer to the sine and cosine functions as cofunctions of each other.
Similarly, the tangent and cotangent functions are cofunctions, as are the se-
cant and cosecant. If u is the radian measure of an acute angle, then the angle
with radian measure 
is complementary to u, and we may consider the
right triangle shown in Figure 3. Using ratios, we see that
These three formulas and their analogues for sec u, csc u, and cot u state that
the function value of u equals the cofunction of the complementary angle
In the following formulas we use subtraction formulas to extend these 
relationships to any real number u, provided the function values are defined.

PROOFS
Using the subtraction formula for cosine, we have
This gives us formula 1.
If we substitute 
for u in the first formula, we obtain
or
Since the symbol v is arbitrary, this equation is equivalent to the second co-
function formula:
Using the tangent identity, cofunction formulas 1 and 2, and the cotangent
identity, we obtain a proof for the third formula:
The proofs of the remaining three formulas are similar.

The following formulas may be used to change the form of certain trigono-
metric expressions from products to sums. We refer to these as product-
to-sum formulas even though two of the formulas express a product as a 
difference, because any difference 
of two real numbers is also a sum
. These formulas are frequently used in calculus as an aid in a
process called integration.
PROOFS
Let us add the left-hand and right-hand sides of the addition and
subtraction formulas for the sine function, as follows:
Dividing both sides of the last equation by 2 gives us formula 1.
Formula 2 is obtained by subtracting the left- and right-hand sides of the
addition and subtraction formulas for the sine function. Formulas 3 and 4 are
developed in a similar fashion, using the addition and subtraction formulas for
the cosine function.

We shall use relationship 1 to define each of the inverse trigonometric
functions.
The sine function is not one-to-one, since different numbers, such as 
, and 
, yield the same function value 
If we restrict the domain
to 
, then, as illustrated by the blue portion of the graph of 
in Figure 1, we obtain a one-to-one (increasing) function that takes on every
value of the sine function once and only once. We use this new function with
domain 
and range 
to define the inverse sine function.
Figure 1
The domain of the inverse sine function is 
, and the range is
.
The notation 
is sometimes read “y is the inverse sine of x.”
The equation 
in the definition allows us to regard y as an angle,
so 
may also be read “y is the angle whose sine is x” (with
).
The inverse sine function is also called the arcsine function, and arcsin x
may be used in place of 
. If 
, then 
, and t may be
interpreted as an arc length on the unit circle U with center at the origin. We
will use both notations—
and arcsin—throughout our work.

We first evaluate the inner expression—
—and then
find the inverse sine of that number:
In words, we have “y is the angle whose sine is 1.” It may be helpful to
recall the arcsine values by associating them with the angles corresponding to
the blue portion of the unit circle shown in Figure 3. From the figure we see
that

The other trigonometric functions may also be used to introduce inverse
trigonometric functions. The procedure is first to determine a convenient sub-
set of the domain in order to obtain a one-to-one function. If the domain of the
cosine function is restricted to the interval 
, as illustrated by the blue por-
tion of the graph of 
in Figure 4, we obtain a one-to-one (decreasing)
function that takes on every value of the cosine function once and only once.
Then, we use this new function with domain 
and range 
to define
the inverse cosine function.

Most of the trigonometric equations we considered in Section 7.2 had
solutions that were rational multiples of , such as 
, and so on.
If solutions of trigonometric equations are not of that type, we can some-
times use inverse functions to express them in exact form, as illustrated in
the next example.

The equation may be regarded as a quadratic equation in

Using the definition of the inverse sine function, we obtain the following 
solutions:
Since the range of arcsin is

as a reference angle, we also have 
as a
solution in quadrant II, as shown in Figure 12(a). We can add

tain a solution in quadrant IV, as shown in Figure 12(b). The solution in quad-

In the first two sections of this chapter we consider methods of solving
oblique triangles using the law of sines and the law of cosines. The next two
sections contain an introduction to vectors—a topic that has many applica-
tions in engineering, the natural sciences, and advanced mathematics. We
then introduce the trigonometric form for complex numbers and use it to
find all n solutions of equations of the form 
, where is any positive
integer and 
and are complex numbers.

De Moivre’s Theorem
and nth Roots of
Complex Numbers
An oblique triangle is a triangle that does not contain a right angle. We shall
use the letters A, B, C, a, b, c,
,
, and 
for parts of triangles, as we did in
Chapter 6. Given triangle ABC, let us place angle 
in standard position so that
B is on the positive x-axis. The case for 
obtuse is illustrated in Figure 1;
however, the following discussion is also valid if 
is acute.
Consider the line through C parallel to the y-axis and intersecting the
x-axis at point D. If we let 
, then the y-coordinate of C is h. From
the definition of the trigonometric functions of any angle,
Referring to right triangle BDC, we see that
Equating the two expressions for h gives us
which we may write as
If we place 
in standard position with C on the positive x-axis, then by
the same reasoning,
The last two equalities give us the following result.
Note that the law of sines consists of the following three formulas:
(1)
(2)
(3)
To apply any one of these formulas to a specific triangle, we must know
the values of three of the four variables. If we substitute these three values into
the appropriate formula, we can then solve for the value of the fourth variable.
It follows that the law of sines can be used to find the remaining parts of an
oblique triangle whenever we know either of the following (the three letters in
parentheses are used to denote the known parts, with S representing a side and
A an angle):

(1) two sides and an angle opposite one of them (SSA)
(2) two angles and any side (AAS or ASA)
In the next section we will discuss the law of cosines and show how it can
be used to find the remaining parts of an oblique triangle when given the
following:
(1) two sides and the angle between them (SAS)
(2) three sides (SSS)
The law of sines cannot be applied directly to the last two cases.
The law of sines can also be written in the form
Instead of memorizing the three formulas associated with the law of sines,
it may be more convenient to remember the following statement, which takes
all of them into account.
In examples and exercises involving triangles, we shall assume that
known lengths of sides and angles have been obtained by measurement and
hence are approximations to exact values. Unless directed otherwise, when
finding parts of triangles we will round off answers according to the following
rule: If known sides or angles are stated to a certain accuracy, then unknown
sides or angles should be calculated to the same accuracy. To illustrate, if
known sides are stated to the nearest 0.1, then unknown sides should be cal-
culated to the nearest 0.1. If known angles are stated to the nearest 
, then
unknown angles should be calculated to the nearest 
. Similar remarks hold
for accuracy to the nearest 0.01, 0.1°, and so on.

The Law of Sines 
(General Form)
In any triangle, the ratio of the sine of an angle to the side opposite that
angle is equal to the ratio of the sine of another angle to the side opposite
that angle.

To find c, we merely replace

obtaining
L
Data such as those in Example 1 lead to exactly one triangle ABC. How-
ever, if two sides and an angle opposite one of them are given, a unique tri-
angle is not always determined. To illustrate, suppose that a and b are to be
lengths of sides of triangle ABC and that a given angle 
is to be opposite the
side of length a. Let us examine the case for 
acute. Place 
in standard po-
sition and consider the line segment AC of length b on the terminal side of ,
as shown in Figure 3. The third vertex, B, should be somewhere on the x-axis.
Since the length a of the side opposite 
is given, we may find B by striking
off a circular arc of length a with center at C. The four possible outcomes are
illustrated in Figure 4 (without the coordinate axes).
The four possibilities in the figure may be described as follows:
(a) The arc does not intersect the x-axis, and no triangle is formed.
(b) The arc is tangent to the x-axis, and a right triangle is formed.
(c) The arc intersects the positive x-axis in two distinct points, and two tri-
angles are formed.
(d) The arc intersects both the positive and the nonpositive parts of the x-axis,
and one triangle is formed.

The particular case that occurs in a given problem will become evident
when the solution is attempted. For example, if we solve the equation
and obtain 
, then no triangle exists and we have case (a). If we ob-
tain 
, then 
and hence (b) occurs. If 
, then there are
two possible choices for the angle . By checking both possibilities, we may
determine whether (c) or (d) occurs.
If the measure of 
is greater than 90°, then a triangle exists if and only if
(see Figure 5). Since we may have more than one possibility when two
sides and an angle opposite one of them are given, this situation is sometimes
called the ambiguous case.

The problem is illustrated in Figure 7. Triangle ABC in Figure 8
also displays the given facts. Note that in Figure 8 we have calculated the fol-
lowing angles:
To find the length of the pole—that is, side a of triangle ABC—we proceed
as follows:

Thus, the telephone pole is approximately 33 feet in length.

Using bearings
A point P on level ground is 3.0 kilometers due north of a point Q. A runner
proceeds in the direction N25°E from Q to a point R, and then from R to P in
the direction S70°W. Approximate the distance run.
SOLUT ION
The notation used to specify directions was introduced in
Section 6.7. The arrows in Figure 9 show the path of the runner, together with
a north-south (dashed) line from R to another point S.
Since the lines through PQ and RS are parallel, it follows from geometry
that the alternate interior angles PQR and QRS both have measure 25°. Hence,
These observations give us triangle PQR in Figure 10 with
We apply the law of sines to find both q and p:

In the preceding section we stated that the law of sines cannot be applied di-
rectly to find the remaining parts of an oblique triangle given either of the 
following:
(1) two sides and the angle between them (SAS)
(2) three sides (SSS)
For these cases we may apply the law of cosines, which follows.
PROOF
Let us prove the first formula. Given triangle ABC, place 
in stan-
dard position, as illustrated in Figure 1. We have pictured 
as obtuse; how-
ever, our discussion is also valid if 
is acute. Consider the dashed line through
C, parallel to the y-axis and intersecting the x-axis at the point 
. If we
let

. By the definition of the trigono-
metric functions of any angle,

Our result is the first formula stated in the law of cosines. The second and third

Note that if

and the law of cosines

case of the law of cosines.
Instead of memorizing each of the three formulas of the law of cosines, it
is more convenient to remember the following statement, which takes all of
them into account.
Given two sides and the included angle of a triangle, we can use the law
of cosines to find the third side. We may then use the law of sines to find an-
other angle of the triangle. Whenever this procedure is followed, it is best to
find the angle opposite the shortest side, since that angle is always acute. In
this way, we avoid the possibility of obtaining two solutions when solving a
trigonometric equation involving that angle, as illustrated in the following
example.

Let us find another angle of the triangle using the law of sines. In accor-

Given the three sides of a triangle, we can use the law of cosines to find
any of the three angles. We shall always find the largest angle first—that is,
the angle opposite the longest side—since this practice will guarantee that the
remaining angles are acute. We may then find another angle of the triangle by
using either the law of sines or the law of cosines. Note that when an angle is
found by means of the law of cosines, there is no ambiguous case, since we al-
ways obtain a unique angle between 0° and 180°.

Quantities such as area, volume, length, temperature, and time have magnitude
only and can be completely characterized by a single real number (with an ap-
propriate unit of measurement such as in2, ft3, cm, deg, or sec). A quantity of
this type is a scalar quantity, and the corresponding real number is a scalar.
A concept such as velocity or force has both magnitude and direction and is
often represented by a directed line segment—that is, a line segment to
which a direction has been assigned. Another name for a directed line segment
is a vector.
As shown in Figure 1, we use 
to denote the vector with initial
point P and terminal point Q, and we indicate the direction of the vector by
placing the arrowhead at Q. The magnitude of 
is the length of the segment 
PQ and is denoted by 
. As in the figure, we use boldface letters such as
u and v to denote vectors whose endpoints are not specified. In handwritten
work, a notation such as 
or 
is often used.
Vectors that have the same magnitude and direction are said to be equiva-
lent. In mathematics, a vector is determined only by its magnitude and direc-

tion, not by its location. Thus, we regard equivalent vectors, such as those in
Figure 1, as equal and write
Thus, a vector may be translated from one location to another, provided nei-
ther the magnitude nor the direction is changed.
We can represent many physical concepts by vectors. To illustrate, sup-
pose an airplane is descending at a constant speed of 
and the line of
flight makes an angle of 20° with the horizontal. Both of these facts are repre-
sented by the vector v of magnitude 100 in Figure 2. The vector v is a veloc-
ity vector.
Figure 2
Velocity vector
A vector that represents a pull or push of some type is a force vector. The
force exerted when a person holds a 5-pound weight is illustrated by the vec-
tor F of magnitude 5 in Figure 3. This force has the same magnitude as the
force exerted on the weight by gravity, but it acts in the opposite direction. As
a result, there is no movement upward or downward.
We sometimes use 
to represent the path of a point (or particle) as it
moves along the line segment from A to B. We then refer to 
as a displace-
ment of the point (or particle). As in Figure 4, a displacement 
followed by
a displacement 
leads to the same point as the single displacement 
. By
definition, the vector AC is the sum of 
and 
, and we write
Since vectors may be translated from one location to another, any two vectors
may be added by placing the initial point of the second vector on the terminal
point of the first and then drawing the line segment from the initial point of the
first to the terminal point of the second, as in Figure 4. We refer to this method
of vector addition as using the triangle law.
Another way to find the sum is to choose vector PQ and vector PR that
are equal to 
and 
, respectively, and have the same initial point P, as
shown in Figure 5. If we construct parallelogram RPQS, then, since

and 
are two forces acting at P, then 
is the resultant force—that is, the single force that produces the same ef-

using the parallelogram law.
If m is a scalar and v is a vector, then mv is defined as a vector whose
magnitude is 
times 
(the magnitude of v) and whose direction is either
the same as that of v (if 
) or opposite that of v (if 
). Illustrations
are given in Figure 6. We refer to mv as a scalar multiple of v.
Figure 6
Scalar multiples
Throughout the remainder of this section we shall restrict our discussion
to vectors that lie in an xy-plane. If 
is such a vector, then, as indicated in
Figure 7, there are many vectors that are equivalent to 
; however, there is
exactly one equivalent vector 
with initial point at the origin. In this
sense, each vector determines a unique ordered pair of real numbers, the co-
ordinates 
of the terminal point A. Conversely, every ordered pair
determines the vector OA, where A has coordinates 
. Thus, there
is a one-to-one correspondence between vectors in an xy-plane and ordered
pairs of real numbers. This correspondence allows us to interpret a vector as
both a directed line segment and an ordered pair of real numbers. To avoid
confusion with the notation for open intervals or points, we use the symbol
(referred to as wedge notation) for an ordered pair that represents a
vector, and we denote it by a boldface letter—for example,
. The
numbers 
and 
are the components of the vector 
. If A is the point 
, as in Figure 7, we call 
the position vector for 
or for the
point A.
The preceding discussion shows that vectors have two different natures,
one geometric and the other algebraic. Often we do not distinguish between
the two. It should always be clear from our discussion whether we are refer-
ring to ordered pairs or directed line segments.
The magnitude of the vector 
is, by definition, the length of its
position vector OA, as illustrated in Figure 8.

Definition of Parallel 
and Orthogonal Vectors
Let be the angle between two nonzero vectors a and b.

(2) a and b are orthogonal if

The vectors a and b in Figure 1 are parallel if and only if they lie on the
same line that passes through the origin. In this case,
for some real
number m. The vectors are orthogonal if and only if they lie on mutually per-
pendicular lines that pass through the origin. We assume that the zero vector 0
is parallel and orthogonal to every vector a.
The next theorem shows the close relationship between the angle between
two vectors and their dot product.
PROOF
If a and b are not parallel, we have a situation similar to that illus-
trated in Figure 1. We may then apply the law of cosines to triangle AOB. Since
the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are 
,
, and 
,
Using the distance formula and the definition of the magnitude of a vector, we
obtain
which reduces to
Dividing both sides of the last equation by 
gives us
which is equivalent to what we wished to prove, since the left-hand side is
.
If a and b are parallel, then either 
or 
, and therefore 
for some real number m with 
if 
and 
if 
. We can
show, using properties of the dot product, that 
,
and hence the theorem is true for all nonzero vectors a and b.

We shall conclude this section with a physical application of the dot prod-
uct. First let us briefly discuss the scientific concept of work.
A force may be thought of as the physical entity that is used to describe a
push or pull on an object. For example, a force is needed to push or pull an ob-
ject along a horizontal plane, to lift an object off the ground, or to move a
charged particle through an electromagnetic field. Forces are often measured
in pounds. If an object weighs 10 pounds, then, by definition, the force re-
quired to lift it (or hold it off the ground) is 10 pounds. A force of this type is
a constant force, since its magnitude does not change while it is applied to the
given object.
If a constant force F is applied to an object, moving it a distance d in the
direction of the force, then, by definition, the work W done is

If F is measured in pounds and d in feet, then the units for W are foot-pounds
(ft-lb). In the cgs (centimeter-gram-second) system a dyne is used as the unit
of force. If F is expressed in dynes and d in centimeters, then the unit for W is
the dyne-centimeter, or erg. In the mks (meter-kilogram-second) system the
newton is used as the unit of force. If F is in newtons and d is in meters, then
the unit for W is the newton-meter, or joule.

Finding the work done by a constant force
Find the work done in pushing an automobile along a level road from a point A
to another point B, 40 feet from A, while exerting a constant force of
90 pounds.
SOLUT ION
The problem is illustrated in Figure 5, where we have pictured
the road as part of a line l. Since the constant force is 
lb and the dis-
tance the automobile moves is 
feet, the work done is

L
The formula 
is very restrictive, since it can be used only if the
force is applied along the line of motion. More generally, suppose that a vec-
tor a represents a force and that its point of application moves along a vector b.
This is illustrated in Figure 6, where the force a is used to pull an object along
a level path from O to B, and

In Section 1.1 we represented real numbers geometrically by using points on
a coordinate line. We can obtain geometric representations for complex num-
bers by using points in a coordinate plane. Specifically, each complex number
determines a unique ordered pair 
. The corresponding point
in a coordinate plane is the geometric representation of 
. To
emphasize that we are assigning complex numbers to points in a plane, we may
label the point 
as

assigned to each point is referred to as a complex (or Argand) plane instead
of an xy-plane. The x-axis is the real axis and the y-axis is the imaginary axis.
In Figure 1 (on the next page) we have represented several complex numbers
geometrically. Note that to obtain the point corresponding to the conjugate
of any complex number 
, we simply reflect through the real axis.

Since the arguments of equal complex numbers differ by a multiple of

equation by n, we see that
Substituting in the trigonometric form for w (see (*)) gives us the formula
If we substitute

Applications of mathematics sometimes require working simultaneously
with more than one equation in several variables—that is, with a system of
equations. In this chapter we develop methods for finding solutions that are
common to all the equations in a system. Of particular importance are the
techniques involving matrices, because they are well suited for computer
programs and can be readily applied to systems containing any number of
linear equations in any number of variables. We shall also consider systems
of inequalities and linear programming—topics that are of major importance
in business applications and statistics. The last part of the chapter provides
an introduction to the algebra of matrices and determinants.

Consider the graphs of the two functions f and g, illustrated in Figure 1. In ap-
plications it is often necessary to find points such as 
and 
at
which the graphs intersect. Since 
is on each graph, the pair 
is a
solution of both of the equations 
and 
; that is,
and
We say that 
is a solution of the system of equations (or simply system)
where the brace is used to indicate that the equations are to be treated simul-
taneously. Similarly, the pair 
is a solution of the system. To solve a sys-
tem of equations means to find all the solutions.
As a special case, consider the system
The graphs of the equations are the parabola and line sketched in Figure 2. The
following table shows that the points

Hence,

Given the system in Example 1, we could have solved one of the equa-

an equation in y alone. Solving the latter equation would give us the y-values
for the solutions of the system. The x-values could then be found using one of

These are the only possible y-values for the solutions of the system. To find the

We can check by substitution in the given equations that all four pairs are

The graph of

and the graph of

sketched in Figure 4. The points of intersection correspond to the solutions of
the system.
There are, of course, other ways to find the solutions. We could solve the
first equation for 
,
, and then substitute in the second, obtain-
ing 
. Another method is to solve the second equation for y,
, and substitute in the first.
L
We can also consider equations in three variables x, y, and z, such as
Such an equation has a solution
if substitution of a, b, and c, for x, y,
and z, respectively, yields a true statement. We refer to 
as an ordered
triple of real numbers. Systems of equations are equivalent systems provided
they have the same solutions. A system of equations in three variables and the
solutions of the system are defined as in the two-variable case. Similarly, we
can consider systems of any number of equations in any number of variables.
The method of substitution can be extended to these more complicated
systems. For example, given three equations in three variables, suppose that it
is possible to solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the re-
maining two variables. By substituting that expression in each of the other
equations, we obtain a system of two equations in two variables. The solutions
of the two-variable system can then be used to find the solutions of the origi-
nal system.

An equation 
(or, equivalently,
), with a and b
not both zero, is a linear equation in two variables x and y. Similarly, the equa-
tion 
is a linear equation in three variables x, y, and z. We
may also consider linear equations in four, five, or any number of variables.
The most common systems of equations are those in which every equation is
linear. In this section we shall consider only systems of two linear equations
in two variables. Systems involving more than two variables are discussed in

Theorem on Equivalent Systems
Given a system of equations, an equivalent system results if
(1) two equations are interchanged.
(2) an equation is multiplied or divided by a nonzero constant.
(3) a constant multiple of one equation is added to another equation.
Two systems of equations are equivalent if they have the same solutions.
To find the solutions of a system, we may manipulate the equations until we
obtain an equivalent system of simple equations for which the solutions can be
found readily. Some manipulations (or transformations) that lead to equivalent
systems are stated in the next theorem.
A constant multiple of an equation is obtained by multiplying each term
of the equation by the same nonzero constant k. When applying part (3) of the
theorem, we often use the phrase add to one equation k times any other equa-
tion. To add two equations means to add corresponding sides of the equations.
The next example illustrates how the theorem on equivalent systems may
be used to solve a system of linear equations.

We often multiply one of the equations by a constant that will
give us the additive inverse of the coefficient of one of the variables in the
other equation. Doing so enables us to add the two equations and obtain an
equation in only one variable, as follows:
multiply the second equation by 3
add the first equation to the second
We see from the last system that 
, and hence 
. To find the
corresponding y-value, we substitute 2 for x in

. Thus,

There are many other ways to use the theorem on equivalent systems to
find the solution. Another approach is to proceed as follows:

The graphs of the two equations are lines that intersect at the point

The technique used in Example 1 is called the method of elimination,
since it involves the elimination of a variable from one of the equations. The
method of elimination usually leads to solutions in fewer steps than does the
method of substitution discussed in the preceding section.

A system of linear equations with no solutions
Solve the system
SOLUT ION
If we add to the second equation 
times the first equation,
, we obtain the equivalent system
The last equation can be written 
, which is false for every ordered
pair 
. Thus, the system has no solution.
The graphs of the two equations in the given system are lines that have the
same slope and hence are parallel (see Figure 3). The conclusion that the sys-
tem has no solution corresponds to the fact that these lines do not intersect.L
The preceding three examples illustrate typical outcomes of solving a sys-
tem of two linear equations in two variables: there is either exactly one solu-
tion, an infinite number of solutions, or no solution. A system is consistent if
it has at least one solution. A system with an infinite number of solutions is de-
pendent and consistent. A system is inconsistent if it has no solution.
Since the graph of any linear equation 
is a line, exactly one
of the three cases listed in the following table holds for any system of two such
equations.
In practice, there should be little difficulty determining which of the three
cases occurs. The case of the unique solution will become apparent when suit-
able transformations are applied to the system, as illustrated in Example 1. The
case of an infinite number of solutions is similar to that of Example 2, where
one of the equations can be transformed into the other. The case of no solution
is indicated by a contradiction, such as the statement 
, which appeared
in Example 3.
In the process of solving a system, suppose we obtain for x a rational num-
ber such as 
. Substituting 
for x to find the value of y is cumbersome.
It is easier to select a different multiplier for each of the original equations that
will enable us to eliminate x and solve for y. This technique is illustrated in the
next example.

Let us introduce variables to denote the unknown quantities as
follows:
Thus, the number of hours of labor required for each crop can be expressed
as follows:
Using the facts that the total number of acres is 100 and the total number of
hours available is 45,000 leads to the following system:
We next use the method of elimination:
divide the second equation by 100
multiply the first equation by

The time (in hours) traveled in each direction is
The distance is 4 miles for each trip. Substituting in

variable. We shall now consider inequalities in two variables x and y, such as
those shown in the following illustration.
Inequalities in x and y
A solution of an inequality in x and y is an ordered pair 
that yields
a true statement if a and b are substituted for x and y, respectively. To solve an
inequality in x and y means to find all the solutions. The graph of such an 
inequality is the set of all points 
in an xy-plane that correspond to the 
solutions. Two inequalities are equivalent if they have the same solutions.
Given an inequality in x and y, if we replace the inequality symbol with
an equal sign, we obtain an equation whose graph usually separates the
xy-plane into two regions. We shall consider only equations having the 
property that if R is one such region and if a test point
in R yields a
solution of the inequality, then every point in R yields a solution. The follow-
ing guidelines may then be used to sketch the graph of the inequality.

Guideline 1
We replace

, obtaining 
. The graph of this
equation is a parabola, symmetric with respect to the x-axis and having 
x-intercept 4 and y-intercepts 
. Since the inequality symbol is 
, we
sketch the parabola using dashes, as in Figure 1.
Guideline 2
The graph in guideline 1 separates the xy-plane into two regions,
one to the left of the parabola and the other to the right. Let us choose test
points 
and 
in the regions (see Figure 1) and substitute for x and
y in 
as follows:
Test point 
LS:
RS:
Since 
is a false statement,
is not a solution of the inequality.
Hence, no point to the left of the parabola is a solution, and we leave that re-
gion unshaded.
Test point 
LS:
RS:
Since 
is a true statement,
is a solution of the inequality. Hence,
all points to the right of the parabola are solutions, so we shade this region, as
in Figure 2.

Guidelines for 
Sketching the Graph of 
an Inequality in x and y
1 Replace the inequality symbol with an equal sign, and graph the result-
ing equation. Use dashes if the inequality symbol is 
or 
to indicate
that no point on the graph yields a solution. Use a solid line or curve for
or 
to indicate that solutions of the equation are also solutions of the
inequality.
2 If R is a region of the xy-plane determined by the graph in guideline 1 
and if a test point 
in R yields a solution of the inequality, then every
point in R yields a solution. Shade R to indicate this fact. If 
is not a
solution, then no point in R yields a solution and R is left unshaded.

The line 
separates the xy-plane into two half-planes, as illus-
trated in Figure 3. The solutions of the inequality consist of all points in one
of these half-planes, where the line is included for 
or 
and is not included
for 
or 
. For a linear inequality, only one test point 
is required, be-
cause if

solutions, whereas if 
is not a solution, then the other half-plane contains
the solutions.

Replacing

with dashes in Figure 4. This line separates the xy-plane into two half-planes,
one above the line and the other below the line. It is convenient to choose the
test point 
above the line and substitute in 
, as follows:
Test point 
LS:

As we did with equations, we sometimes work simultaneously with sev-
eral inequalities in two variables—that is, with a system of inequalities. The
solutions of a system of inequalities are the solutions common to all inequal-
ities in the system. The graph of a system of inequalities consists of the points
corresponding to the solutions. The following examples illustrate a method for
solving systems of inequalities.

If a system of inequalities contains only linear inequalities of the form
where a, b, and c are real numbers, then the graph of the system may be a re-
gion R in the xy-plane bounded by a polygon—possibly of the type illustrated
in Figure 1 (for a specific illustration, see Example 4 and Figure 7 of Sec-
tion 9.3). For problems in linear programming, we consider such systems to-
gether with an expression of the form
where A, B, and K are real numbers and 
is a point in R (that is, a solu-
tion of the system). Since for each 
we obtain a specific value for C, we
call C a function of two variables x and y. In linear programming, C is called
an objective function, and the inequalities in the system are referred to as the
constraints on C. The solutions of the system—that is, the pairs 
corre-
sponding to the points in R—are called the feasible solutions for the problem.
In typical business applications, the value of C may represent cost, profit,
loss, or a physical resource, and the goal is to find a specific point 
in R
at which C takes on its maximum or minimum value. The methods of linear
programming greatly simplify the task of finding this point. Specifically, it can
be shown that the maximum and minimum values of C occur at a vertex of R.
This fact is used in the next example.

,
as illustrated in Figure 3. To find the maximum value of C, we simply deter-
mine which of these lines that intersect the region has the largest y-intercept
. Referring to Figure 3, we see that the required line passes through 
.
Similarly, for the minimum value of C, we determine the line having equa-
tion 
that intersects the region and has the smallest
y-intercept. This is the line through 
.
We shall call a problem that can be expressed in the form of Example 1 a
linear programming problem. To solve such problems, we may use the fol-
lowing guidelines.

Maximizing profit
A firm manufactures two products, X and Y. For each product, it is necessary
to use three different machines, A, B, and C. To manufacture one unit of prod-
uct X, machine A must be used for 3 hours, machine B for 1 hour, and ma-
chine C for 1 hour. To manufacture one unit of product Y requires 2 hours on
A, 2 hours on B, and 1 hour on C. The profit on product X is $500 per unit,
and the profit on product Y is $350 per unit. Machine A is available for a total
of 24 hours per day; however, B can be used for only 16 hours and C for
9 hours. Assuming the machines are available when needed (subject to the
noted total hour restrictions), determine the number of units of each product
that should be manufactured each day in order to maximize the profit.
SOLUT ION
The following table summarizes the data given in the statement
of the problem.
Let us introduce the following variables:
Using the first row of the table, we note that each unit of X requires 3 hours
on machine A, and hence x units require 3x hours. Similarly, since each unit of
Y requires 2 hours on A, y units require 2y hours. Hence, the total number of
hours per day that machine A must be used is 
. This, together with the
fact that A can be used for at most 24 hours per day, gives us the first constraint
in the following system of inequalities—that is,
. The second
and third constraints are obtained by using the same type of reasoning for
rows 2 and 3 of the table. The last two constraints,
and 
, are true
because x and y cannot be negative.
The graph of this system is the region R in Figure 5.

Since the production of each unit of product X yields a profit of $500 and

ducing x units of X together with y units of Y is
This is the objective function for the problem. The maximum value of P must
occur at one of the vertices of R in Figure 5. The values of P at these vertices
are given in the following table.
We see from the table that a maximum profit of $4050 occurs for a daily pro-

(continued)
Since A ordered 35 units and B ordered 60 units, we must have
Our goal is to determine values for x and y that make the total shipping cost
minimal.
The number of units shipped from 
cannot exceed 80, and the number
shipped from 
cannot exceed 70. Expressing these facts in terms of in-
equalities gives us
Simplifying, we obtain the first two constraints in the following system. The
last two constraints are true because the largest values of x and y are 35 and
60, respectively.
The graph of this system is the region R shown in Figure 6.
Let C denote the total cost (in dollars) of shipping the disk players to
customers A and B. We see from the table of shipping costs that the following
are true:
Hence, the total cost is
Simplifying gives us the following objective function:
To determine the minimum value of C on R, we need check only the vertices

We see from the table that the minimal shipping cost, $1015, occurs if 
and 
. This means that the distributor should ship all of the disk players
to A from 
and none from 
. In addition, the distributor should ship
45 units to B from 
and 15 units to B from 
. (Note that the maximum ship-
ping cost will occur if 
and 
—that is, if all 35 units are shipped
to A from 
and if B receives 25 units from 
and 35 units from 
.)
The examples in this section are elementary linear programming prob-
lems in two variables that can be solved by basic methods. The much more
complicated problems in many variables that occur in practice may be solved
by employing matrix techniques (discussed later) that are adapted for solu-

19 Maximizing passenger capacity A small community wishes
to purchase used vans and small buses for its public trans-
portation system. The community can spend no more than
$100,000 for the vehicles and no more than $500 per month
for maintenance. The vans sell for $10,000 each and aver-
age $100 per month in maintenance costs. The correspon-
ding cost estimates for each bus are $20,000 and $75 per
month. If each van can carry 15 passengers and each bus
can accommodate 25 riders, determine the number of vans
and buses that should be purchased to maximize the pas-
senger capacity of the system.
20 Minimizing fuel cost Refer to Exercise 19. The monthly
fuel cost (based on 5000 miles of service) is $550 for each
van and $850 for each bus. Find the number of vans and
buses that should be purchased to minimize the monthly
fuel costs if the passenger capacity of the system must be 
at least 75.
21 Stocking a fish farm A fish farmer will purchase no more
than 5000 young trout and bass from the hatchery and will
feed them a special diet for the next year. The cost of food
per fish will be $0.50 for trout and $0.75 for bass, and the
total cost is not to exceed $3000. At the end of the year, a
typical trout will weigh 3 pounds, and a bass will weigh 
4 pounds. How many fish of each type should be stocked in
the pond in order to maximize the total number of pounds
of fish at the end of the year?
22 Dietary planning A hospital dietician wishes to prepare a
corn-squash vegetable dish that will provide at least 3 grams
of protein and cost no more than 36¢ per serving. An ounce
of creamed corn provides gram of protein and costs 4¢. An 
ounce of squash supplies gram of protein and costs 3¢. For
taste, there must be at least 2 ounces of corn and at least as
much squash as corn. It is important to keep the total num-
ber of ounces in a serving as small as possible. Find the
combination of corn and squash that will minimize the
amount of ingredients used per serving.
23 Planning storage units A contractor has a large building
that she wishes to convert into a series of rental storage
spaces. She will construct basic 8 ft  10 ft units and deluxe
12 ft  10 ft units that contain extra shelves and a clothes
closet. Market considerations dictate that there be at least
twice as many basic units as deluxe units and that the basic
units rent for $75 per month and the deluxe units for $120
per month. At most 7200 
is available for the storage
spaces, and no more than $80,000 can be spent on con-
struction. If each basic unit will cost $800 to make and each
deluxe unit will cost $1600, how many units of each type
should be constructed to maximize monthly revenue?
24 A moose’s diet A moose feeding primarily on tree leaves
and aquatic plants is capable of digesting no more than 
33 kilograms of these foods daily. Although the aquatic
plants are lower in energy content, the animal must eat at
least 17 kilograms to satisfy its sodium requirement. A kilo-
gram of leaves provides four times as much energy as a
kilogram of aquatic plants. Find the combination of foods
that maximizes the daily energy intake.

Any system of three linear equations in three variables has either a unique
solution, an infinite number of solutions, or no solution. As for two equations
in two variables, the terminology used to describe these systems is consistent,
dependent and consistent, or inconsistent, respectively.
If we analyze the method of solution in Example 1, we see that the sym-
bols used for the variables are immaterial. The coefficients of the variables are
what we must consider. Thus, if different symbols such as r, s, and t are used
for the variables, we obtain the system
The method of elimination can then proceed exactly as in the example. Since
this is true, it is possible to simplify the process. Specifically, we introduce a
scheme for keeping track of the coefficients in such a way that we do not have
to write down the variables. Referring to the preceding system, we first check

that variables appear in the same order in each equation and that terms not in-
volving variables are to the right of the equal signs. We then list the numbers
that are involved in the equations as follows:
An array of numbers of this type is called a matrix. The rows of the matrix
are the numbers that appear next to each other horizontally:

The matrix obtained from a system of linear equations in the preceding
manner is the matrix of the system. If we delete the last column of this ma-
trix, the remaining array of numbers is the coefficient matrix. Since the ma-
trix of the system can be obtained from the coefficient matrix by adjoining one
column, we call it the augmented coefficient matrix or simply the aug-
mented matrix. Later, when we use matrices to find the solutions of a system
of linear equations, we shall introduce a vertical line segment in the aug-
mented matrix to indicate where the equal signs would appear in the corre-
sponding system of equations, as in the next illustration.
Coefficient Matrix and Augmented Matrix
Before discussing a matrix method of solving a system of linear equa-
tions, let us state a general definition of a matrix. We shall use a double sub-
script notation, denoting the number that appears in row i and column j by

The row subscript of

The notation 
in the definition is read “m by n.” We often say that
the matrix is
and call 
the size of the matrix. It is possible to con-
sider matrices in which the symbols 
represent complex numbers, polyno-
mials, or other mathematical objects. The rows and columns of a matrix are
defined as before. Thus, the matrix in the definition has m rows and n columns.
Note that 
is in row 2 and column 3 and 
is in row 3 and column 2. Each
is an element of the matrix. If 
, the matrix is a square matrix of
order n and the elements 
are the main diagonal elements.
Matrices
To find the solutions of a system of linear equations, we begin with the
augmented matrix. If a variable does not appear in an equation, we assume that
the coefficient is zero. We then work with the rows of the matrix just as though
they were equations. The only items missing are the symbols for the vari-
ables, the addition or subtraction signs used between terms, and the equal
signs. We simply keep in mind that the numbers in the first column are the co-
efficients of the first variable, the numbers in the second column are the coef-
ficients of the second variable, and so on. The rules for transforming a matrix
are formulated so that they always produce a matrix of an equivalent system of
equations.
The next theorem is a restatement, in terms of matrices, of the theorem on
equivalent systems in Section 9.2. In part (2) of the theorem, the terminology
a row is multiplied by a nonzero constant means that each element in the row
is multiplied by the constant. To add two rows of a matrix, as in part (3), we
add corresponding elements in each row.

We refer to 1–3 as the elementary row transformations of a matrix. If
a matrix is obtained from another matrix by one or more elementary row trans-
formations, the two matrices are said to be equivalent or, more precisely, row
equivalent. We shall use the symbols in the following chart to denote ele-
mentary row transformations of a matrix, where the arrow 
may be read 
“replaces.” Thus, for the transformation 
, the constant multiple 
replaces

The following guidelines may be used to find echelon forms.
Not all echelon forms contain rows consisting of only zeros (see 
Example 2).
We can use elementary row operations to transform the matrix of any sys-
tem of linear equations to echelon form. The echelon form can then be used to
produce a system of equations that is equivalent to the original system. The 
solutions of the given system may be found by back substitution. The next

equations is not the same as the number of variables. The same matrix tech-
niques are applicable, as illustrated in the next example.

SOLUT ION
We shall begin with the augmented matrix and then find a re-
duced echelon form. There are many different ways of getting the number 1
into the first position of the first row. For example, the elementary row trans-
formation 
or 
would accomplish this in one step.
Another way, which does not involve fractions, is demonstrated in the follow-
ing steps:
The reduced echelon form is the matrix of the system
or, equivalently,
There are an infinite number of solutions to this system; they can be found by
assigning z any value c and then using the last two equations to express x and
y in terms of c. This gives us
Thus, the solutions of the system consist of all ordered triples of the form
for any real number c. The solutions may be checked by substituting 
for
x,
for y, and c for z in the two original equations.
We can obtain any number of solutions for the system by substituting spe-
cific real numbers for c. For example, if 
, we obtain 
; if 
,
we have 
; and so on.

A system of linear equations is homogeneous if all the terms that do not
contain variables—that is, the constant terms—are zero. A system of homo-
geneous equations always has the trivial solution obtained by substituting
zero for each variable. Nontrivial solutions sometimes exist. The procedure for
finding solutions is the same as that used for nonhomogeneous systems.

should be produced each week for maximum profit? What is the maximum

SOLUT ION
(a) We see from the table that the graph of 
contains 
the points 
,
, and 
. This gives us the system
of equations
It is easy to solve any of the equations for c, so we’ll start solving the system
by solving the first equation for c,
and then substituting that expression for c in the other two equations:
Note that we have reduced the system of three equations and three variables to
two equations and two variables. Simplifying the system gives us
At this point we could divide the equations by 25, but we see that 75 is just 3
times 25, so we’ll use the method of elimination to eliminate b:
Adding the equations gives us 
so 
We can verify that
the solution is 
,
,
.

Solving a mixture problem
A merchant wishes to mix two grades of peanuts costing $3 and $4 per pound,
respectively, with cashews costing $8 per pound, to obtain 140 pounds of a
mixture costing $6 per pound. If the merchant also wants the amount of
lower-grade peanuts to be twice that of the higher-grade peanuts, how many
pounds of each variety should be mixed?
SOLUT ION
Let us introduce three variables, as follows:
We refer to the statement of the problem and obtain the following system:
You may verify that the solution of this system is 
,
,
.
Thus, the merchant should use 40 pounds of the $3lb peanuts, 20 pounds of
the $4lb peanuts, and 80 pounds of cashews.

Sometimes we can combine row transformations to simplify our work.
For example, consider the augmented matrix
.
To obtain a 1 in the first column, it appears we have to multiply row 1 by
or row 2 by . However, we can multiply row 1 by 2 and row 2 by 3 and
then add those two rows to obtain
in column one, as shown in the next matrix:
We can then proceed to find the reduced echelon form without the cum-
bersome use of fractions. This process is called using a linear combination 
of rows.

Matrices were introduced in Section 9.5 as an aid to finding solutions of sys-
tems of equations. In this section we discuss some of the properties of matri-
ces. These properties are important in advanced fields of mathematics and in
applications.
In the following definition, the symbol 
denotes an 
matrix A of
the type displayed in the definition on page 601. We use similar notations for
the matrices B and C.
Note that two matrices are equal if and only if they have the same size and
corresponding elements are equal.
Equality of Matrices
Using the parentheses notation for matrices, we may write the definition
of addition of two 
matrices as
Thus, to add two matrices, we add the elements in corresponding positions in
each matrix. Two matrices can be added only if they have the same size.

columns in which every element is 0.
Zero Matrices

of the matrix 
is the matrix 
ob-
tained by changing the sign of each nonzero element of A.

Product of a Real Number and a Matrix
We can prove the following.
The next definition, of the product AB of two matrices, may seem unusual,
but it has many uses in mathematics and applications. For multiplication, un-
like addition, A and B may have different sizes; however, the number of columns
of A must be the same as the number of rows of B. Thus, if A is 
, then B must
be 
for some p. As we shall see, the size of AB is then 
. 
If

in row i and column j of
C is given in the following guidelines.

A matrix is a row matrix if it has only one row. A column matrix has
only one column. The following illustration contains some products involving
row and column matrices. You should check each entry in the products.
Products Involving Row and Column Matrices
The product operation for matrices is not commutative. For example, if A
is 
and B is 
, then AB may be found, since the number of columns
of A is the same as the number of rows of B. However, BA is undefined, since
the number of columns of B is different from the number of rows of A. Even
if AB and BA are both defined, it is often true that these products are different.
This is illustrated in the next example, along with the fact that the product of
two nonzero matrices may equal a zero matrix.

SOLUT ION
Using the definition of the product of two matrices, we obtain
the following:
Hence,
. Note that the last equality shows that the product of two
nonzero matrices can equal a zero matrix.
L
Although matrix multiplication is not commutative, it is associative. Thus,
if A is 
, B is 
, and C is 
, then
The distributive properties also hold if the matrices involved have the
proper number of rows and columns. If 
and 
are 
matrices and if
and 
are 
matrices, then
As a special case, if all matrices are square, of order n, then both the associa-
tive and the distributive property are true.
We conclude this section with an application of the product of two
matrices.

Throughout this section and the next two sections we shall restrict our discus-
sion to square matrices. The symbol 
will denote the square matrix of order
n that has 1 in each position on the main diagonal and 0 elsewhere. We call 
the identity matrix of order n.
Identity Matrices
We can show that if A is any square matrix of order n, then
Recall that when we are working with a nonzero real number b, the unique
number 
(the multiplicative inverse of b) may be multiplied times b to ob-
tain the multiplicative identity (the number 1)—that is,
We have a similar situation with matrices.

The Inverse of a Matrix
Definition of the 
Inverse of a Matrix
Let A be a square matrix of order n. If there exists a matrix B such that
then B is called the inverse of A and is denoted

If a square matrix A has an inverse, then we say that A is invertible. If a
matrix is not square, then it cannot have an inverse. For matrices (unlike real
numbers), the symbol 
does not represent the inverse 
.
If A is invertible, we can calculate 
using elementary row operations.
If 
is 
, we begin with the 
matrix formed by adjoining
to A:
We next apply a succession of elementary row transformations, as we did in
Section 9.5 to find reduced echelon forms, until we arrive at a matrix of 
the form
in which the identity matrix 
appears to the left of the vertical rule. It can be
shown that the 
matrix 
is the inverse of A—that is,

Not all square matrices are invertible. In fact, if the procedure used in Ex-
amples 1 and 2 does not lead to an identity matrix to the left of the vertical
rule, then the matrix A has no inverse—that is, A is not invertible.
We may apply inverses of matrices to solutions of systems of linear equa-
tions. Consider the case of two linear equations in two unknowns:
This system can be expressed in terms of matrices as
If we let
then a matrix form for the system is
If 
exists, then multiplying both sides of the last equation by 
gives us
. Since 
and 
, this leads to
from which the solution 
may be found. This technique (which we refer
to as the inverse method) may be extended to systems of n linear equations in
n unknowns.

If we are solving a system of linear equations without the aid of any com-
putational device, then the inverse method of solution in Example 3 is benefi-
cial only if 
is known (or can be easily computed) or if many systems with
the same coefficient matrix are to be considered.
If we are using a computational device and if the coefficient matrix is not
invertible, then the inverse method cannot be used, and the preferred method
of solution is the matrix method discussed in Section 9.5. There are other im-
portant uses for the inverse of a matrix that arise in more advanced fields of
mathematics and in applications of such fields.

Associated with each square matrix A is a number called the determinant of
A, denoted by

the absolute value of a real number. To avoid any misunderstanding, the ex-

by be-
ginning with the case in which A has order 1 and then increasing the order one
at a time. As we shall see in Section 9.9, these definitions arise in a natural way
when systems of linear equations are solved.
If A is a square matrix of order 1, then A has only one element. Thus,

Definition of

Let 
be a square matrix of order

To determine the minor of an element, we delete the row and column in
which the element appears and then find the determinant of the resulting
square matrix. This process is demonstrated in the following illustration,
where deletions of rows and columns in a 
matrix are indicated with
horizontal and vertical line segments, respectively.
To obtain the cofactor of 
of a square matrix 
, we find the minor
and multiply it by 1 or 
, depending on whether the sum of i and j is even or
odd, respectively, as demonstrated in the illustration.

For the matrix in the preceding illustration, there are six other minors—

—that can be obtained in similar fashion.
Another way to remember the sign 
associated with the cofactor 
is to consider the following checkerboard style of plus and minus signs:

Theorem on Expansion

Note that all but one of the elements in the third row are zero.
Hence, if we expand 
by the third row, there will be at most one nonzero
term. Specifically,
with
We expand 
by column 1:
Thus,
L
In general, if all but one element in some row (or column) of A are zero
and if the determinant 
is expanded by that row (or column), then all terms
drop out except the product of that element with its cofactor. If all elements in
a row (or column) are zero, we have the following.
PROOF
If every element in a row (or column) of a square matrix A is zero,
then the expansion by that row (or column) is a sum of terms that are zero
(since each term is zero times its respective cofactor). Hence, this sum is equal
to zero, and we conclude that

In the previous section we found that if we could not obtain the identity
matrix on the left side of the adjoined matrix, then the original matrix was not
invertible. If we obtain a row of zeros in this process, we certainly cannot ob-
tain the identity matrix. Combining this fact with the previous theorem leads
to the following theorem.

Evaluating a determinant by using the expansion theorem stated in Section 9.8
is inefficient for matrices of high order. For example, if a determinant of a ma-
trix of order 10 is expanded by any row, a sum of 10 terms is obtained, and
each term contains the determinant of a matrix of order 9, which is a cofactor
of the original matrix. If any of the latter determinants is expanded by a row
(or column), a sum of 9 terms is obtained, each containing the determinant of
a matrix of order 8. Hence, at this stage there are 90 determinants of matrices
of order 8 to evaluate. The process could be continued until only determinants
of matrices of order 2 remain. You may verify that there are 1,814,400 such
matrices of order 2! Unless many elements of the original matrix are zero, it is
an enormous task to carry out all of the computations.
In this section we discuss rules that simplify the process of evaluating
determinants. The main use for these rules is to introduce zeros into the 
determinant. They may also be used to change the determinant to echelon
form—that is, to a form in which the elements below the main diagonal ele-
ments are all zero (see Section 9.5). The transformations on rows stated in the
next theorem are the same as the elementary row transformations of a matrix
introduced in Section 9.5. However, for determinants we may also use similar
transformations on columns.
When using the theorem, we refer to the rows (or columns) of the deter-
minant in the obvious way. For example, property 3 may be phrased as fol-
lows: Adding k times any row (or column) to another row (or column) of a
determinant does not affect the value of the determinant.

Properties of Determinants
Theorem on Row and 
Column Transformations 
of a Determinant
Let A be a square matrix of order n.
(1) If a matrix B is obtained from A by interchanging two rows (or
columns), then 
.
(2) If B is obtained from A by multiplying every element of one row (or
column) of A by a real number k, then 
.
(3) If B is obtained from A by adding k times any row (or column) of A to
another row (or column) for a real number k, then 
—that is,
the determinants of B and A are equal.

Row transformations of determinants will be specified by means of the
symbols 
,
, and 
, which were introduced in Sec-
tion 9.5. Analogous symbols are used for column transformations. For exam-
ple,
means “add k times the ith column to the jth column.”
Property 2 of the theorem on row and column transformations is useful for
finding factors of determinants. To illustrate, for a determinant of a matrix of
order 3, we have the following:
Similar formulas hold if k is a common factor of the elements of any other row
or column. When referring to this manipulation, we often use the phrase k is a
common factor of the row (or column).
The following are illustrations of the preceding theorem, with the reason
for each equality stated at the right.

cal rows (or columns), then B and A are the same and, consequently,

We plan to use property 3 of the theorem on row and column
transformations of a determinant to introduce three zeros in some row or 
column. It is convenient to work with an element of the matrix that equals 1,
since this enables us to avoid the use of fractions. If 1 is not an element of
the original matrix, it is always possible to introduce the number 1 by using
property 2 or 3 of the theorem. In this example, 1 appears in row 3, and we
proceed as follows, with the reason for each equality stated at the right.
L
The next two examples illustrate the use of property 2 of the theorem on
row and column transformations of a determinant.

Determinants arise in the study of solutions of systems of linear equations.
To illustrate, let us consider two linear equations in two variables x and y:
where at least one nonzero coefficient appears in each equation. We may as-
sume that

and we could then regard y as the first
variable instead of x. We shall use elementary row transformations to obtain
the matrix of an equivalent system with

Thus, the given system is equivalent to
which may also be written
If 
, we can solve the second equation for y, obtaining
The corresponding value for x may be found by substituting for y in the
first equation, which leads to
This proves that if the determinant of the coefficient matrix of a system of two
linear equations in two variables is not zero, then the system has a unique so-
lution. The last two formulas for x and y as quotients of determinants consti-
tute Cramer’s rule for two variables.
There is an easy way to remember Cramer’s rule. Let
be the coefficient matrix of the system, and let 
denote the matrix obtained
from D by replacing the coefficients

of x by the numbers

Cramer’s rule is an inefficient method to apply if the system has a large
number of equations, since many determinants of matrices of high order must
be evaluated. Note also that Cramer’s rule cannot be used directly if 
or if the number of equations is not the same as the number of variables. 
For numerical calculations, the inverse method and the matrix method are su-
perior to Cramer’s rule; however, the Cramer’s rule formulation is theoretically
useful.

In this section we show how systems of equations can be used to help decom-
pose rational expressions into sums of simpler expressions. This technique is
useful in advanced mathematics courses.
We may verify that
by adding the fractions 
and 
to obtain 
. The
expression on the right-hand side of this equation is called the partial fraction
decomposition of 
.
It is theoretically possible to write any rational expression as a sum of ra-
tional expressions whose denominators involve powers of polynomials of de-
gree not greater than two. Specifically, if 
and 
are polynomials and the
degree of 
is less than the degree of 
, it can be proved that
such that each 
has one of the forms
where A and B are real numbers, m and n are nonnegative integers, and the
quadratic polynomial 
is irreducible over  (that is, has no real
zero). The sum 
is the partial fraction decomposition of
, and each 
is a partial fraction.

For the partial fraction decomposition of

sential that

long division to obtain such an expression. For example, given
we obtain
We then find the partial fraction decomposition of

The following guidelines can be used to obtain decompositions.
We shall apply the preceding guidelines in the following examples. For
the sake of convenience, we will use the variables A, B, C, and so on, rather
than the subscripted variables

fraction decomposition contains a sum of m partial fractions of the

Find the partial fraction decomposition of

The degree of the numerator, 2, is less than the degree of the de-
nominator, 3, so long division is not required.
Guideline 2
We factor the denominator:
Guideline 3
Each factor of the denominator has the form stated in Rule A 
with 
. Thus, to the factor x there corresponds a partial fraction of the
form 
. Similarly, to the factors 
and 
there correspond partial
fractions of the form

, respectively. The partial frac-
tion decomposition has the form
Guideline 4
We find the values of A, B, and C in guideline 3. Multiplying both
sides of the partial fraction decomposition by the least common denominator,
, gives us
Equating the coefficients of like powers of x on each side of the last equation,
we obtain the system of equations
Using the methods of Section 9.5 yields the solution 
,
, and
. Hence, the partial fraction decomposition is
There is an alternative way to find A, B, and C if all factors of the denomi-
nator are linear and nonrepeated, as in this example. Instead of equating coef-
ficients and using a system of equations, we begin with the equation

70 Production scheduling A company manufactures a power
lawn mower and a power edger. These two products are of
such high quality that the company can sell all the products 
it makes, but production capability is limited in the areas of
machining, welding, and assembly. Each week the company
has 600 hours available for machining, 300 hours for weld-
ing, and 550 hours for assembly. The number of hours re-
quired for the production of a single item is shown in the
following table. The profits from the sale of a mower and an
edger are $100 and $80, respectively. How many mowers and
edgers should be made each week to maximize the profit?
71 Maximizing investment income A retired couple wishes to

a high-risk stock that has an expected annual rate of return
(or interest) of 12%, a low-risk stock that has an expected
annual return of 8%, and government-issued bonds that pay
annual interest of 4% and involve no risk. To protect the
value of the investment, the couple wishes to place at least
twice as much in the low-risk stock as in the high-risk stock
and use the remainder to buy bonds. How should the money
be invested to maximize the expected annual return?

Sequences and summation notation, discussed in the first section, are very
important in advanced mathematics and applications. Of special interest are
arithmetic and geometric sequences, considered in Sections 10.2 and 10.3.
We then discuss the method of mathematical induction, a process that is
often used to prove that each statement in an infinite sequence of statements
is true. As an application, we use it to prove the binomial theorem in Sec-
tion 10.5. The last part of the chapter deals with counting processes that
occur frequently in mathematics and everyday life. These include the con-
cepts of permutations, combinations, and probability.

An arbitrary infinite sequence may be denoted as follows:
For convenience, we often refer to infinite sequences as sequences. We may re-
gard an infinite sequence as a collection of real numbers that is in one-to-one
correspondence with the positive integers. Each number 
is a term of the se-
quence. The sequence is ordered in the sense that there is a first term
, a sec-
ond term
, a forty-fifth term
, and, if n denotes an arbitrary positive integer,
an nth term
. Infinite sequences are often defined by stating a formula for 
the nth term.
Infinite sequences occur frequently in mathematics. For example, the 
sequence
may be used to represent the rational number . In this case the nth term gets
closer and closer to as n increases.
We may regard an infinite sequence as a function. Recall from Section 3.4
that a function f is a correspondence that assigns to each number x in the do-
main D exactly one number 
in the range R. If we restrict the domain to
the positive integers 
, we obtain an infinite sequence, as in the fol-
lowing definition.
In our work, the range of an infinite sequence will be a set of real 
numbers.
If a function f is an infinite sequence, then to each positive integer n there
corresponds a real number 
. These numbers in the range of f may be rep-
resented by writing
To obtain the subscript form of a sequence, as shown at the beginning of this
section, we let

Definition of Infinite Sequence
An infinite sequence is a function whose domain is the set of positive 
integers.
If we regard a sequence as a function f, then we may consider its graph in
an xy-plane. Since the domain of f is the set of positive integers, the only
points on the graph are
where 
is the nth term of the sequence as shown in Figure 1. We sometimes
use the graph of a sequence to illustrate the behavior of the nth term 
as n in-
creases without bound.
Figure 1
Graph of a sequence
From the definition of equality of functions we see that a sequence
is equal to a sequence
if and only if 
for every positive integer k.
Another notation for a sequence with nth term 
is 
. For example, the
sequence 
has nth term 
. Using sequence notation, we write this se-
quence as follows:
By definition, the sequence 
is the function f with 
for every posi-
tive integer n.

Finding terms of a sequence
List the first four terms and the tenth term of each sequence:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
SOLUT ION
To find the first four terms, we substitute, successively,
,
2, 3, and 4 in the formula for . The tenth term is found by substituting 10 for
n. Doing this and simplifying gives us the following:

For some sequences we state the first term 
, together with a rule for 
obtaining any term 
from the preceding term 
whenever 
. We call
such a statement a recursive definition, and the sequence is said to be defined
recursively.
E X A M P L E  3
Finding terms of a recursively defined sequence
Find the first four terms and the nth term of the infinite sequence defined re-
cursively as follows:
SOLUT ION
The first four terms are
given
We have written the terms as products to gain some insight into the nature of
the nth term. Continuing, we obtain 
,
, and, in general,
for every positive integer n.
L
If only the first few terms of an infinite sequence are known, then it is im-
possible to predict additional terms. For example, if we were given 3, 6, 9, . . .
and asked to find the fourth term, we could not proceed without further infor-
mation. The infinite sequence with nth term
has for its first four terms 3, 6, 9, and 120. It is possible to describe sequences
in which the first three terms are 3, 6, and 9 and the fourth term is any given
number. This shows that when we work with an infinite sequence it is essential
to have either specific information about the nth term or a general scheme for
obtaining each term from the preceding one. (See Exercise 1 of the Chapter 10
Discussion Exercises for a related problem.)
We sometimes need to find the sum of many terms of an infinite sequence.
To express such sums easily, we use summation notation. Given an infinite
sequence
the symbol 
represents the sum of the first m terms, as follows.

The Greek capital letter sigma,

repre-

variable, and the numbers 1 and m indicate the smallest and largest values of
the summation variable, respectively.

The rapid growth of terms of a geometric sequence
A man wishes to save money by setting aside 1 cent the first day, 2 cents the
second day, 4 cents the third day, and so on.
(a) If he continues to double the amount set aside each day, how much must
he set aside on the fifteenth day?
(b) Assuming he does not run out of money, what is the total amount saved at
the end of the 30 days?
SOLUT ION
(a) The amount (in cents) set aside on successive days forms a geometric 
sequence
with first term 1 and common ratio 2. We find the amount to be set aside on
the fifteenth day by using 
with 
and 
:
Thus, $163.84 should be set aside on the fifteenth day.
(b) To find the total amount saved after 30 days, we use the formula for 
with 
, obtaining (in cents)
Thus, the total amount saved is $10,737,418.23.

The terminology used with geometric sequences is analogous to that used
with arithmetic sequences. If a and b are positive real numbers, then a positive
number c is called the geometric mean of a and b if a, c, b is a geometric se-
quence. If the common ratio is r, then
Taking the square root of both sides of the last equation, we see that the geo-
metric mean of the positive numbers a and b is
. As a generalization, k
positive real numbers 
are k geometric means between a and b if
is a geometric sequence. The process of determining these
numbers is referred to as inserting k geometric means between a and b.

Each number

It is easy to show that ,

are true statements. However, it is impos-
sible to check the validity of

is
true for every n requires the following principle.
To help us understand this principle, we consider an infinite sequence of
statements labeled
that satisfy conditions (1) and (2). By (1), statement 
is true. Since condi-
tion (2) holds, whenever a statement 
is true the next statement 
is also
true. Hence, since 
is true,
is also true, by (2). However, if 
is true, then,
by (2), we see that the next statement 
is true. Once again, if 
is true, then,
by (2),
is also true. If we continue in this manner, we can argue that if n is
any particular integer, then 
is true, since we can use condition (2) one step
at a time, eventually reaching . Although this type of reasoning does not ac-
tually prove the principle of mathematical induction, it certainly makes it plau-
sible. The principle is proved in advanced algebra using postulates for the
positive integers.

When applying the principle of mathematical induction, we always follow
two steps.
Step 2 often causes confusion. Note that we do not prove that

(except for

happens to be true, then the
statement 
is also true. We refer to the assumption that

The 
st coefficient can be written in a compact form by using fac-
torial notation. If n is any nonnegative integer, then the symbol 
(n facto-
rial) is defined as follows.
Thus, if 
, then n! is the product of the first n positive integers. The
definition 
is used so that certain formulas involving factorials are true
for all nonnegative integers.
n Factorial
Notice the rapid growth of n! as n increases.
We sometimes wish to simplify quotients where both the numerator and
the denominator contain factorials, as shown in the next illustration.
Simplifying Quotients of Factorials
As in the preceding illustration, if n and k are positive integers and
, then
which is the numerator of the coefficient of the 
term of 
. Di-
viding by the denominator k! gives us the following alternative form for the
coefficient:
These numbers are called binomial coefficients and are often denoted by
either the symbol

The binomial theorem may be stated as follows.
Using summation notation, we may write the binomial theorem
Note that there are 
terms (not n terms) in the expansion of 
,
and so
is a formula for the 
term of the expansion.
An alternative statement of the binomial theorem is as follows. (A proof
is given at the end of this section.)
The following examples may be solved either by using the general for-
mulas for the binomial theorem or by repeated use of property 4, stated at the
beginning of this section.

PROOF OF THE BINOMIAL THEOREM
For each positive integer n, let 
denote the statement given in the alternative form of the binomial theorem.
Step 1
If 
, the statement reduces to 
. Consequently,
is true.
Step 2
Assume that 
is true. Thus, the induction hypothesis is
We have shown both the rth term and the 
term in the above 
expansion.
To prove that 
is true, we first write
Using the induction hypothesis to substitute for 
and then multiplying
that expression by 
, we obtain
where the terms in the first pair of brackets result from multiplying the right-
hand side of the induction hypothesis by a and the terms in the second pair of
brackets result from multiplying by b. We next rearrange and combine terms:
If the coefficients are simplified, we obtain statement 
with 
substituted
for n. Thus,
is true, and therefore 
holds for every positive integer n,
which completes the proof.

Suppose that four teams are involved in a tournament in which first, second,
third, and fourth places will be determined. For identification purposes, we
label the teams A, B, C, and D. Let us find the number of different ways that
first and second place can be decided. It is convenient to use a tree diagram,
as in Figure 1. After the word START, the four possibilities for first place are
listed. From each of these an arrow points to a possible second-place finisher.
The final standings list the possible outcomes, from left to right. They are
found by following the different paths (branches of the tree) that lead from the
word START to the second-place team. The total number of outcomes is 12,
which is the product of the number of choices (4) for first place and the num-
ber of choices (3) for second place (after first has been determined).
Let us now find the total number of ways that first, second, third, and
fourth positions can be filled. To sketch a tree diagram, we may begin by draw-
ing arrows from the word START to each possible first-place finisher A, B, C,
or D. Next we draw arrows from those to possible second-place finishers, as
was done in Figure 1. From each second-place position we then draw arrows
indicating the possible third-place positions. Finally, we draw arrows to the
fourth-place team. If we consider only the case in which team A finishes in 
first place, we have the diagram shown in Figure 2.

Note that there are six possible final standings in which team A occupies
first place. In a complete tree diagram there would also be three other branches
of this type corresponding to first-place finishes for B, C, and D. A complete
diagram would display the following 24 possibilities for the final standings:
A first
ABCD, ABDC, ACBD, ACDB, ADBC, ADCB,
B first
BACD, BADC, BCAD, BCDA, BDAC, BDCA,
C first
CABD, CADB, CBAD, CBDA, CDAB, CDBA,
D first
DABC, DACB, DBAC, DBCA, DCAB, DCBA.
Note that the number of possibilities (24) is the product of the number of ways
(4) that first place may occur, the number of ways (3) that second place may
occur (after first place has been determined), the number of possible outcomes
(2) for third place (after the first two places have been decided), and the num-
ber of ways (1) that fourth place can occur (after the first three places have
been taken).
The preceding discussion illustrates the following general rule, which we
accept as a basic axiom of counting.
Returning to our first illustration, we let 
represent the determination of
the first-place team, so that 
. If 
denotes the determination of the 
second-place team, then 
. Hence, the number of outcomes for the se-
quence 
is 
, which is the same as that found by means of the
tree diagram. If we proceed to 
, the determination of the third-place team,
then 
, and hence 
. Finally, if 
, and 
have occurred,
there is only one possible outcome for 
. Thus,
, and 
.
Instead of teams, let us now regard a, b, c, and d merely as symbols and
consider the various orderings, or arrangements, that may be assigned to these
symbols, taking them either two at a time, three at a time, or four at a time. By
abstracting in this way we may apply our methods to other similar situations.
The arrangements we have discussed are arrangements without repetitions,
since a symbol may not be used more than once in an arrangement. In Ex-
ample 1 we shall consider arrangements in which repetitions are allowed.
Previously we defined ordered pairs and ordered triples. Similarly, an or-
dered 4-tuple is a set containing four elements 
in which an order-
ing has been specified, so that one of the elements may be referred to as the
first element, another as the second element, and so on. The symbol
is used for the ordered 4-tuple having first element 
, second

as a set of r elements in which

as the
second element, and so on.

Determining the number of r-tuples
Using only the letters a, b, c, and d, determine how many of the following can
be obtained:
(a) ordered triples
(b) ordered 4-tuples
(c) ordered r-tuples
SOLUT ION
(a) We must determine the number of symbols of the form 
that can
be obtained using only the letters a, b, c, and d. This is not the same as listing
first, second, and third place as in our previous illustration, since we have not
ruled out the possibility of repetitions. For example,
,
, and
are different ordered triples. If, for 
, we let 
represent the
determination of 
in the ordered triple 
, then, since repetitions are
allowed, there are four possibilities—a, b, c, and d—for each of 
and
. Hence, by the fundamental counting principle, the total number of ordered
triples is 
, or 64.
(b) The number of possible ordered 4-tuples of the form 
is
, or 256.
(c) The number of ordered r-tuples is the product

appearing as a factor r times. That product equals .

Choosing class officers
A class consists of 60 girls and 40 boys. In how many ways can a president,
vice-president, treasurer, and secretary be chosen if the treasurer must be a girl,
the secretary must be a boy, and a student may not hold more than one office?
SOLUT ION
If an event is specialized in some way (for example, the treas-
urer must be a girl), then that event should be considered before any nonspe-
cialized events. Thus, we let 
represent the choice of treasurer and 
the
choice of secretary. Next we let 
and 
denote the choices for president and
vice-president, respectively. As in the fundamental counting principle, we let
denote the number of different ways 
can occur for 
, 2, 3, and 4. It
follows that 
,
,

the fundamental counting principle, the total number of possibilities is

When working with sets, we are usually not concerned about the order or
arrangement of the elements. In the remainder of this section, however, the
arrangement of the elements will be our main concern.

We also use the phrase permutation of n elements taken r at a time. The
symbol 
will denote the number of different permutations of r elements
that can be obtained from a set of n elements. As a special case,
de-
notes the number of arrangements of n elements of S—that is, the number of
ways of arranging all the elements of S.
In our first discussion involving the four teams A, B, C, and D, we had
, since there are 12 different ways of arranging the four teams in
groups of two. We also showed that the number of ways to arrange all the
elements A, B, C, and D is 24. In permutation notation we would write this
result as 
.
The next theorem gives us a general formula for 
.
PROOF
The problem of determining 
is equivalent to determining the
number of different r-tuples 
such that each 
is an element of S
and no element of S appears twice in the same r-tuple. We may find this num-
ber by means of the fundamental counting principle. For each 
,
let 
represent the determination of the element 
and let 
be the number of
different ways of choosing . We wish to apply the sequence 
.
We have n possible choices for , and consequently 
. Since repetitions
are not allowed, we have 
choices for 
, so 
. Continuing in
this manner, we successively obtain 
,
, and ultimately
or, equivalently,
. Hence, using the funda-
mental counting principle, we obtain the formula for 
.
Note that the formula for 
in the previous theorem contains exactly
r factors on the right-hand side, as shown in the following illustration.

B
B
W
R
for the arrangement having black disks in the first three positions in the row,
the white disk in the fourth position, and the red disk in the fifth position. The
first three disks can be arranged in 3!, or 6, different ways, but these arrange-
ments cannot be distinguished from one another because the first three disks
look alike. We say that those 3! permutations are nondistinguishable. Simi-
larly, given any other arrangement, say
B
R
B
W
B,
there are 3! different ways of arranging the three black disks, but again each
such arrangement is nondistinguishable from the others. Let us call two
arrangements of objects distinguishable permutations if one arrangement
cannot be obtained from the other by rearranging like objects. Thus,
B B B W R and B R B W B are distinguishable permutations of the five disks.
Let k denote the number of distinguishable permutations. Since to each such
arrangement there correspond 3! nondistinguishable permutations, we must
have 
, the number of permutations of five different objects. Hence,
. By the same type of reasoning we can obtain the fol-
lowing extension of this discussion.
We can generalize this theorem to the case in which there are several sub-
collections of nondistinguishable objects. For example, consider eight disks,
of which four are black, three are white, and one is red. In this case, with each
arrangement, such as
B
W
B
W
B
W
B
R,
there are 4! arrangements of the black disks and 3! arrangements of the white
disks that have no effect on the color arrangement. Hence, 4!3! possible
arrangements of the disks will not produce distinguishable permutations. If we
let k denote the number of distinguishable permutations, then

First Theorem on

of distinguishable permutations of the n objects is

since 8! is the number of permutations we would obtain if the disks were all
different. Thus, the number of distinguishable permutations is

In this example we are given a collection of eleven objects in

theorem, we have 
and the number of distinguishable

When we work with permutations, our concern is with the orderings or
arrangements of elements. Let us now ignore the order or arrangement of ele-
ments and consider the following question: Given a set containing n distinct
elements, in how many ways can a subset of r elements be chosen with 
?
Before answering, let us state a definition.
If S contains n elements, we also use the phrase combination of n ele-
ments taken r at a time. The symbol 
will denote the number of com-
binations of r elements that can be obtained from a set of n elements.

Definition of Combination
Let S be a set of n elements and let 
. A combination of r ele-
ments of S is a subset of S that contains r distinct elements.
1  r  n
PROOF
If S contains n elements, then, to find 
, we must find the total
number of subsets of the form
such that the 
are different elements of S. Since the r elements
can be arranged in 
different ways, each such subset produces 
different 
r-tuples. Thus, the total number of different r-tuples is 
. However, in
the previous section we found that the total number of r-tuples is
Hence,
Dividing both sides of the last equation by 
gives us the formula for 
.L
From the proof, note that
which means that there are more permutations than combinations when we
choose a subset of r elements from a set of n elements. To remember this re-
lationship, consider a presidency, say Bush-Quayle. There is only one group or
combination of these two people, but when a president–vice-president order-
ing is associated with these two people, there are two permutations, and Bush-
Quayle is clearly different from Quayle-Bush.
As you read the examples and work the exercises, keep the following in
mind.
If the order of selection is important, use a permutation.
If the order of selection is not important, use a combination.

Being dealt a full house
In one type of poker, a five-card hand is dealt from a standard 52-card deck.
(a) How many hands are possible?
(b) A full house is a hand that consists of three cards of one denomination and
two cards of another denomination. (The 13 denominations are 2’s, 3’s, 4’s,
5’s, 6’s, 7’s, 8’s, 9’s, 10’s, J’s, Q’s, K’s, and A’s.) How many hands are full
houses?
SOLUT ION
(a) The order in which the five cards are dealt is not important, so we use a
combination:
(b) We first determine how many ways we can be dealt a specific full
house—say 3 aces and 2 kings (see Figure 1). There are four cards of each de-
nomination and the order of selection can be ignored, so we use combinations:
number of ways to get 3 A’s
number of ways to get 2 K’s
Now we must pick the two denominations. Since 3 A’s and 2 K’s is a different
full house than 3 K’s and 2 A’s, the order of selecting the denominations is im-
portant, and so we use a permutation:
number of ways to select two denominations
By the fundamental counting principle, the number of full houses is

If two dice are tossed, what are the chances of rolling a 7? If a person is dealt
five cards from a standard deck of 52 playing cards, what is the likelihood of
obtaining three aces? In the seventeenth century, similar questions about
games of chance led to the study of probability. Since that time, the theory of
probability has grown extensively. It is now used to predict outcomes of a large
variety of situations that arise in the natural and social sciences.
Any chance process, such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, being dealt a
card from a deck, determining if a manufactured item is defective, or finding
the blood pressure of an individual, is an experiment. A result of an experi-
ment is an outcome. We will restrict our discussion to experiments for which
outcomes are equally likely unless stated otherwise. This means, for example,
that if a coin is flipped, we assume that the possibility of obtaining a head is
the same as that of obtaining a tail. Similarly, if a die is tossed, we assume that
the die is fair—that is, there is an equal chance of obtaining either a 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, or 6. The set S of all possible outcomes of an experiment is the sample
space of the experiment. Thus, if the experiment consists of flipping a coin
and we let H or T denote the outcome of obtaining a head or tail, respectively,
then the sample space S may be denoted by
If a fair die is tossed as an experiment, then the set S of all possible outcomes
(the sample space) is
The following definition expresses, in mathematical terms, the notion of
obtaining particular outcomes of an experiment.
Let us consider the experiment of tossing a single die, so that the sample
space is 
. If 
, then the event E associated with the ex-
periment consists of the outcome of obtaining a 4 on the toss. Different events

Definition of Event
Let S be the sample space of an experiment. An event associated with the
experiment is any subset E of S.
may be associated with the same experiment. For example, if we let 
then this event consists of obtaining an odd number on a toss of the die.
As another illustration, suppose the experiment consists of flipping two
coins, one after the other. If we let HH denote the outcome in which two heads
appear, HT that of a head on the first coin and a tail on the second, and so on,
then the sample space S of the experiment may be denoted by
If we let
then the event E consists of the appearance of a head on one of the coins and
a tail on the other.
Next we shall define what is meant by the probability of an event.
Throughout our discussion we will assume that the sample space S of an ex-
periment contains only a finite number of elements. If E is an event, the sym-
bols
and
will denote the number of elements in E and S, respectively.
Keep in mind that E and S consist of outcomes that are equally likely.
Since E is a subset of S, we see that
Dividing by 
, we obtain

The next example provides three illustrations of the preceding definition

In part (a) of Example 1 we found that the probability of obtaining a head
on a flip of a coin is . We take this to mean that if a coin is flipped many times,
the number of times that a head turns up should be approximately one-half the
total number of flips. Thus, for 100 flips, a head should turn up approximately

implies that if we let the number of flips increase, then the number of times a
head turns up approaches one-half the total number of flips. Similar remarks
can be made for parts (b) and (c) of Example 1.
In the next two examples we consider experiments in which an event con-
tains more than one element.

Finding probabilities when two dice are tossed

Let us refer to one die as the first die and the other as the sec-
ond die. We shall use ordered pairs to represent outcomes as follows:
de-
notes the outcome of obtaining a 2 on the first die and a 4 on the second; 
represents a 5 on the first die and a 3 on the second; and so on. Since there are
six different possibilities for the first number of the ordered pair and, with each
of these, six possibilities for the second number, the total number of ordered
pairs is

SOLUT ION
The sample space S of the experiment is the set of all possible
five-card hands that can be formed from the 52 cards in the deck. It follows
from our work in the preceding section that 
.
Since there are 13 cards in the heart suit, the number of different ways of
obtaining a hand that contains five hearts is 
. Hence, if E represents
this event, then
This result implies that if the experiment is performed many times, a five-card
heart hand should be drawn approximately once every 2000 times.
L
Suppose S is the sample space of an experiment and 
and 
are two
events associated with the experiment. If 
and 
have no elements in com-
mon, they are called disjoint sets and we write 
(the empty set).
In this case, if one event occurs, the other cannot occur; they are mutually ex-
clusive events. Thus, if 
, then
Hence,
or
The probability of E is therefore the sum of the probabilities of 
and

have proved the following.
The preceding theorem can be extended to any number of events

that are mutually exclusive in the sense that if

Finding the probability of drawing a certain hand of cards
If 13 cards are drawn from a deck, what is the probability that at least 2 of the

SOLUT ION
If 
denotes the probability of getting k hearts, then the
probability of getting at least two hearts is
Since the only remaining probabilities are 
and 
, the desired proba-
bility is equal to
To calculate 
for any k, we may regard the deck as being split into two
groups: hearts and non-hearts. For 
we note that of the 13 hearts in the
deck, we get none; and of the 39 non-hearts, we get 13. Since the number of
ways to choose 13 cards from a 52-card deck is 
, we see that
The probability 
corresponds to getting 1 of the hearts and 12 of the
39 non-hearts. Thus,
Hence, the desired probability is
L
The words probability and odds are often used interchangeably. While
knowing one allows us to calculate the other, they are quite different.
We can think of the odds in favor of an event E as the number of ways E
occurs compared to the number of ways E doesn’t occur. Similarly, the odds
against E occurring are given by 
to

We can depict this probability, as well
as the probability of its complement, with the tree diagram shown in Figure 2.
The probabilities for the second card depend on what the first card was. To
cover all possibilities for the second card, we attach branches with similar
probabilities to the end of each branch of the first tree diagram, as shown in

Expected value of a single pull-tab
States that run lotteries often offer games in which a certain number of pull-
tabs are printed, some being redeemable for money and the rest worthless.
Suppose that in a particular game there are 4000 pull-tabs, 432 of which are
redeemable according to the following table.
Find the expected value of a pull-tab that sells for $1.
SOLUT ION
The payoff amounts $100, $50, $20, and $2 have probabilities 
and 
respectively. The remaining 3568 pull-tabs have a pay-
off amount of $0. By the preceding definition, the expected value of a single
pull-tab is
Thus, after subtracting the $1 cost of the pull-tab, we can expect to lose $0.50
on each pull-tab we buy. Note that we cannot lose $0.50 on any individual
pull-tab, but we can expect to lose this amount on each pull-tab in the long run.
This game yields a terribly poor return for the buyer and a healthy profit for
the seller.
L
The expected value of $0.50 obtained in Example 11 may be considered
to be the amount we would expect to pay to play the game if the game were
fair—that is, if we would not expect to win or lose any money after playing
the game many times.
In this section we have merely introduced several basic concepts about
probability. The interested person is referred to entire books and courses de-

57 Shooting craps In the game of craps, there are two ways a
player can win a pass line bet. The player wins immediately
if two dice are rolled and their sum is 7 or 11. If their sum
is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, the player can still win a pass line bet
if this same number (called the point) is rolled again before
a 7 is rolled. Find the probability that the player wins
(a) a pass line bet on the first roll
(b) a pass line bet with a 4 on the first roll
(c) on any pass line bet
58 Crapless craps Refer to Exercise 57. In the game of craps, a
player loses a pass line bet if a sum of 2, 3, or 12 is obtained
on the first roll (referred to as “craps”). In another version 
of the game, called crapless craps, the player does not lose
by rolling craps and does not win by rolling an 11 on the 
first roll. Instead, the player wins if the first roll is a 7 or if
the point (2–12, excluding 7) is repeated before a 7 is 
rolled. Find the probability that the player wins on a pass 
line bet in crapless craps.

Plane geometry includes the study of figures—such as lines, circles, and tri-
angles—that lie in a plane. Theorems are proved by reasoning deductively
from certain postulates. In analytic geometry, plane geometric figures are
investigated by introducing coordinate systems and then using equations
and formulas. If the study of analytic geometry were to be summarized by
means of one statement, perhaps the following would be appropriate: Given
an equation, find its graph, and conversely, given a graph, find its equation.
In this chapter we shall apply coordinate methods to several basic plane
figures.

Analytic Geometry
The conic sections, also called conics, can be obtained by intersecting a 
double-napped right circular cone with a plane. By varying the position of the
plane, we obtain a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola, as illustrated
in Figure 1.
Figure 1
(a) Circle
(b) Ellipse
(c) Parabola
(d) Hyperbola
Degenerate conics are obtained if the plane intersects the cone in only one
point or along either one or two lines that lie on the cone. Conic sections were
studied extensively by the ancient Greeks, who discovered properties that en-
able us to state their definitions in terms of points and lines, as we do in our
discussion.
From our work in Section 3.6, if 
, the graph of 
is a parabola with a vertical axis. We shall next state a general definition of a
parabola and derive equations for parabolas that have either a vertical axis or
a horizontal axis.
We shall assume that F is not on l, for this would result in a line. If P is a
point in the plane and 
is the point on l determined by a line through P that

Definition of a Parabola
A parabola is the set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed
point F (the focus) and a fixed line l (the directrix) that lie in the plane.
is perpendicular to l (see Figure 2), then, by the preceding definition, P is on
the parabola if and only if the distances 
and 
are equal. The
axis of the parabola is the line through F that is perpendicular to the directrix.
The vertex of the parabola is the point V on the axis halfway from F to l. The
vertex is the point on the parabola that is closest to the directrix.
To obtain a simple equation for a parabola, place the y-axis along the axis
of the parabola, with the origin at the vertex V, as shown in Figure 3. In this
case, the focus F has coordinates 
for some real number 
, and the
equation of the directrix is 
. (The figure shows the case 
.) By the
distance formula, a point 
is on the graph of the parabola if and only if
—that is, if
We square both sides and simplify:
An equivalent equation for the parabola is
We have shown that the coordinates of every point 
on the parabola
satisfy 
. Conversely, if 
is a solution of 
, then by re-
versing the previous steps we see that the point 
is on the parabola.
If 
, the parabola opens upward, as in Figure 3. If 
, the
parabola opens downward. The graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis,
since substitution of 
for x does not change the equation 
.
If we interchange the roles of x and y, we obtain
or, equivalently,
This is an equation of a parabola with vertex at the origin, focus 
,
and opening right if 
or left if 
. The equation of the directrix is
.
For convenience we often refer to “the parabola 
” (or 
)
instead of “the parabola with equation 
” (or 
).

From our discussion of translations in Section 3.5, we recognize that the graph
of the second equation can be obtained from the graph of the first equation by
shifting it h units to the right and k units up—thereby moving the vertex from

An important property is associated with a tangent line to a parabola. (A
tangent line to a parabola is a line that has exactly one point in common with
the parabola but does not cut through the parabola.) Suppose l is the tangent
line at a point 
on the graph of 
, and let F be the focus. As in
Figure 8, let 
denote the angle between l and the line segment FP, and let 
denote the angle between l and the indicated horizontal half-line with end-
point P. It can be shown that 
. This reflective property has many appli-
cations. For example, the shape of the mirror in a searchlight is obtained by 
revolving a parabola about its axis. The resulting three-dimensional surface is
said to be generated by the parabola and is called a paraboloid. The focus of
the paraboloid is the same as the focus of the generating parabola. If a light
source is placed at F, then, by a law of physics (the angle of reflection equals
the angle of incidence), a beam of light will be reflected along a line parallel
to the axis (see Figure 9(a)). The same principle is used in the construction of
mirrors for telescopes or solar ovens—a beam of light coming toward the para-
bolic mirror and parallel to the axis will be reflected into the focus (see

An ellipse may be defined as follows. (Foci is the plural of focus.)
We can construct an ellipse on paper as follows: Insert two pushpins in the
paper at any points F and 
, and fasten the ends of a piece of string to the pins.
After looping the string around a pencil and drawing it tight, as at point P in
Figure 1, move the pencil, keeping the string tight. The sum of the distances
and 
is the length of the string and hence is constant; thus, the
pencil will trace out an ellipse with foci at F and 
. The midpoint of the seg-
ment 
is called the center of the ellipse. By changing the positions of F
and 
while keeping the length of the string fixed, we can vary the shape of the
ellipse considerably. If F and 
are far apart so that 
is almost the same
as the length of the string, the ellipse is flat. If 
is close to zero, the el-
lipse is almost circular. If 
, we obtain a circle with center F.

Ellipses
Definition of an Ellipse
An ellipse is the set of all points in a plane, the sum of whose distances
from two fixed points (the foci) in the plane is a positive constant.
To obtain a simple equation for an ellipse, choose the x-axis as the line
through the two foci F and 
, with the center of the ellipse at the origin. If 
F has coordinates 
with 
, then, as in Figure 2,
has coordi-
nates 
. Hence, the distance between F and 
is 2c. The constant sum
of the distances of P from F and 
will be denoted by 2a. To obtain points
that are not on the x-axis, we must have 
—that is,
. By defini-
tion,
is on the ellipse if and only if the following equivalent equations
are true:
Squaring both sides of the last equation gives us
or
Squaring both sides again yields
or
Dividing both sides by 
, we obtain
Recalling that 
and therefore 
, we let
This substitution gives us the equation
Since 
and 
, it follows that 
and hence 
.
We have shown that the coordinates of every point 
on the ellipse in
Figure 3 satisfy the equation 
. Conversely, if 
is a
solution of this equation, then by reversing the preceding steps we see that the
point 
is on the ellipse.

We may find the x-intercepts of the ellipse by letting 
in the equa-
tion. Doing so gives us 
, or 
. Consequently, the x-intercepts
are a and 
. The corresponding points 
and 
on the graph are
called the vertices of the ellipse (see Figure 3). The line segment 
is called
the major axis. Similarly, letting 
in the equation, we obtain 
,
or 
. Hence, the y-intercepts are b and 
. The segment between
and 
is called the minor axis of the ellipse. The major axis
is always longer than the minor axis, since 
.
Applying tests for symmetry, we see that the ellipse is symmetric with re-
spect to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the origin.
Similarly, if we take the foci on the y-axis, we obtain the equation
In this case, the vertices of the ellipse are 
and the endpoints of the
minor axis are 
, as shown in Figure 4.

as follows:
We now complete the squares for the expressions within parentheses:
By adding 4 to the expression within the first parentheses we have added 64 to
the left-hand side of the equation, and hence we must compensate by adding
64 to the right-hand side. Similarly, by adding 1 to the expression within the
second parentheses we have added 9 to the left-hand side, and consequently
we must also add 9 to the right-hand side. The last equation may be written
Dividing by 144 to obtain 1 on the right-hand side gives us
The graph of the last equation is an ellipse with center 
and major
axis on the vertical line 
(since

Ellipses can be very flat or almost circular. To obtain information about
the roundness of an ellipse, we sometimes use the term eccentricity, which is
defined as follows, with a, b, and c having the same meanings as before.
Consider the ellipse

2a of the major axis is fixed and the length 2b of the minor axis is variable

orbit of each planet in the solar system is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.
Most of these orbits are almost circular, so their corresponding eccentricities
are close to 0. To illustrate, for Earth,
; for Mars,
; and for
Uranus,
. The orbits of Mercury and Pluto are less circular, with ec-
centricities of 0.206 and 0.249, respectively.
Many comets have elliptical orbits with the sun at a focus. In this case the
eccentricity e is close to 1, and the ellipse is very flat. In the next example we
use the astronomical unit (AU)—that is, the average distance from Earth to the
sun—to specify large distances

An ellipse has a reflective property analogous to that of the parabola dis-
cussed at the end of the previous section. To illustrate, let l denote the tangent
line at a point P on an ellipse with foci F and 
, as shown in Figure 13. If 
is the acute angle between 
and l and if 
is the acute angle between FP
and l, it can be shown that 
. Thus, if a ray of light or sound emanates
from one focus, it is reflected to the other focus. This property is used in the
design of certain types of optical equipment.
If the ellipse with center O and foci 
and F on the x-axis is revolved
about the x-axis, as illustrated in Figure 14, we obtain a three-dimensional sur-
face called an ellipsoid. The upper half or lower half is a hemi-ellipsoid, as 
is the right half or left half. Sound waves or other impulses that are emitted
from the focus 
will be reflected off the ellipsoid into the focus F. This prop-
erty is used in the design of whispering galleries—structures with ellipsoidal
ceilings, in which a person who whispers at one focus can be heard at the other
focus. Examples of whispering galleries may be found in the Rotunda of the
Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., and in the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt
Lake City.
The reflective property of ellipsoids (and hemi-ellipsoids) is used in mod-
ern medicine in a device called a lithotripter, which disintegrates kidney stones
by means of high-energy underwater shock waves. After taking extremely ac-
curate measurements, the operator positions the patient so that the stone is at
a focus. Ultra–high frequency shock waves are then produced at the other
focus, and reflected waves break up the kidney stone. Recovery time with this
technique is usually 3–4 days, instead of the 2–3 weeks with conventional
surgery. Moreover, the mortality rate is less than 0.01%, as compared to 2–3%
for traditional surgery (see Exercises 51–52).

The definition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse. The only change
is that instead of using the sum of distances from two fixed points, we use the
difference.
To find a simple equation for a hyperbola, we choose a coordinate system
with foci at 
and 
and denote the (constant) distance by 2a.
The midpoint of the segment 
(the origin) is called the center of the hy-
perbola. Referring to Figure 1, we see that a point 
is on the hyperbola
if and only if either of the following is true:
If P is not on the x-axis, then from Figure 1 we see that
because the length of one side of a triangle is always less than the sum of the
lengths of the other two sides. Similarly,
Equivalent forms for the previous two inequalities are
Since the differences on the left-hand sides of these inequalities both equal 
2a and since 
, the last two inequalities imply that 
, or
. (Recall that for ellipses we had 
.)
Next, equations (1) and (2) may be replaced by the single equation
Using the distance formula to find 
and 
, we obtain an equation
of the hyperbola:
Employing the type of simplification procedure that we used to derive an equa-
tion for an ellipse, we can rewrite the preceding equation as

We have shown that the coordinates of every point 
on the hyperbola
in Figure 1 satisfy the equation 
. Conversely, if 
is
a solution of this equation, then by reversing steps we see that the point 
is on the hyperbola.
Applying tests for symmetry, we see that the hyperbola is symmetric with
respect to both axes and the origin. We may find the x-intercepts of the hyper-
bola by letting 
in the equation. Doing so gives us 
, or 
,
and consequently the x-intercepts are a and 
. The corresponding points
and 
on the graph are called the vertices of the hyperbola (see
Figure 2). The line segment 
is called the transverse axis. The graph has
no y-intercept, since the equation 
has the complex solutions
. The points 
and 
are endpoints of the conjugate
axis
. The points W and 
are not on the hyperbola; however, as we shall
see, they are useful for describing the graph.
Figure 2
Solving the equation 
for y gives us
If 
or, equivalently,
, then there are no points 
on
the graph. There are points 
on the graph if 
or 
.
It can be shown that the lines
are asymptotes for the hyper-
bola. These asymptotes serve as excellent guides for sketching the graph. A
convenient way to sketch the asymptotes is to first plot the vertices 
,
and the points 
,
(see Figure 2). If vertical and hori-
zontal lines are drawn through these endpoints of the transverse and conjugate
axes, respectively, then the diagonals of the resulting auxiliary rectangle have

the asymptotes as guides. The two parts that make up the hyperbola are called
the right branch and the left branch of the hyperbola.
Similarly, if we take the foci on the y-axis, we obtain the equation
In this case, the vertices of the hyperbola are

The last equation indicates that the hyperbola has center 
with ver-
tices and foci on the horizontal line 
, because the term containing x is
positive. We also know that
Hence,
As illustrated in Figure 9, the vertices are

—that is,

L
The results of Sections 11.1 through 11.3 indicate that the graph of every
equation of the form
is a conic, except for certain degenerate cases in which a point, one or two
lines, or no graph is obtained. Although we have considered only special ex-
amples, our methods can be applied to any such equation. If A and C are equal
and not 0, then the graph, when it exists, is a circle or, in exceptional cases, a
point. If A and C are unequal but have the same sign, an equation is obtained
whose graph, when it exists, is an ellipse (or a point). If A and C have oppo-
site signs, an equation of a hyperbola is obtained or possibly, in the degener-
ate case, two intersecting straight lines. If either A or C (but not both) is 0, the
graph is a parabola or, in certain cases, a pair of parallel lines.
We shall conclude this section with an application involving hyperbolas.

SOLUT ION
Let us introduce a coordinate system, as shown in Figure 10(a),
with the stations at points A and B on the x-axis and the ship at P on the line
. Since at 1:00 P.M. it takes 400 microseconds longer for the signal to
arrive from B than from A, the difference 
in the indicated distances at
that time is
Dividing by 5280 
gives us
At 1:00 P.M., point P is on the right branch of a hyperbola whose equation is
(see Figure 10(b)), consisting of all points whose dif-
ference in distances from the foci B and A is 
. In our derivation of the
equation 
, we let 
; it follows that in the
present situation
Since the distance c from the origin to either focus is 100,
Hence, an (approximate) equation for the hyperbola that has foci A and B and
passes through P is
If we let 
(the y-coordinate of P), we obtain
Solving for x gives us 
. Rounding off to the nearest mile, we find
that the coordinates of P are approximately (42, 50).
L
An extension of the method used in Example 6 is the basis for the navi-
gational system LORAN (for Long Range Navigation). This system involves
two pairs of radio transmitters, such as those located at T,
and S,
in Fig-
ure 11. Suppose that signals sent out by the transmitters at T and 
reach a
radio receiver in a ship located at some point P. The difference in the times of
arrival of the signals can be used to determine the difference in the distances
of P from T and 
. Thus, P lies on one branch of a hyperbola with foci at T
and 
. Repeating this process for the other pair of transmitters, we see that P
also lies on one branch of a hyperbola with foci at S and 
. The intersection
of these two branches determines the position of P.
A hyperbola has a reflective property analogous to that of the ellipse dis-
cussed in the previous section. To illustrate, let l denote the tangent line at a

If f is a function, the graph of the equation 
is often called a plane
curve. However, this definition is restrictive, because it excludes many useful
graphs. The following definition is more general.
For simplicity, we often refer to a plane curve as a curve. The graph of
C in the preceding definition consists of all points 
in an
xy-plane, for t in I. We shall use the term curve interchangeably with graph of
a curve. We sometimes regard the point 
as tracing the curve C as t varies
through the interval I.
The graphs of several curves are sketched in Figure 1, where I is a closed
interval 
—that is,
In part (a) of the figure,
and
and 
are called the endpoints of C. The curve in (a) intersects itself;
that is, two different values of t produce the same point. If 
as in
Figure 1(b), then C is a closed curve. If 
and C does not intersect
itself at any other point, as in Figure 1(c), then C is a simple closed curve.
A convenient way to represent curves is given in the next definition.

The curve C in this definition is referred to as a parametrized curve, and
the parametric equations are a parametrization for C. We often use the
notation
to indicate the domain I of f and g. We can refer to these equations as the
x-equation and the y-equation.
Sometimes it may be possible to eliminate the parameter and obtain a fa-
miliar equation in x and y for C. In simple cases we can sketch a graph of a pa-
rametrized curve by plotting points and connecting them in order of increasing
t, as illustrated in the next example.

We use the parametric equations to tabulate coordinates of
points 
on C, as follows.
Plotting points leads to the sketch in Figure 2. The arrowheads on the
graph indicate the direction in which 
traces the curve as t increases
from 1 to 2.
We may obtain a more familiar description of the graph by eliminating the 
parameter. Solving the x-equation for t, we obtain 
Substituting this ex-
pression for t in the y-equation gives us

As indicated by the arrowheads in Figure 2, the point 
traces the
curve C from left to right as t increases. The parametric equations
give us the same graph; however, as t increases,
traces the curve from
right to left. For other parametrizations, the point 
may oscillate back
and forth as t increases.

The orientation of a parametrized curve C is the direction determined by
increasing values of the parameter. We often indicate an orientation by plac-
ing arrowheads on C, as in Figure 2. If 
moves back and forth as t in-
creases, we may place arrows alongside of C.
As we have observed, a curve may have different orientations, depending
on the parametrization. To illustrate, the curve C in Example 1 is given para-
metrically by any of the following:
The next example demonstrates that it is sometimes useful to eliminate
the parameter before plotting points.

When x and y contain trigonometric functions of t, we can
often eliminate the parameter t by isolating the trigonometric functions, squar-
ing both sides of the equations, and then using one of the Pythagorean identi-
ties, as follows:

measure of the angle generated by the line segment OP.

In the next example, we use parametric equations to model the path of a
projectile (object). These equations are developed by means of methods in
physics and calculus. We assume that the object is moving near the surface of
Earth under the influence of gravity alone; that is, air resistance and other
forces that could affect acceleration are negligible. We also assume that the
ground is level and the curvature of Earth is not a factor in determining the
path of the object.

This curve has a number of important physical properties. To illustrate, sup-
pose a thin wire passes through two fixed points A and B, as shown in Figure 8,
and that the shape of the wire can be changed by bending it in any manner.
Suppose further that a bead is allowed to slide along the wire and the only
force acting on the bead is gravity. We now ask which of all the possible paths
will allow the bead to slide from A to B in the least amount of time. It is natu-
ral to believe that the desired path is the straight line segment from A to B;
however, this is not the correct answer. The path that requires the least time co-
incides with the graph of an inverted cycloid with A at the origin. Because the
velocity of the bead increases more rapidly along the cycloid than along the
line through A and B, the bead reaches B more rapidly, even though the dis-
tance is greater.
There is another interesting property of this curve of least descent. Sup-
pose that A is the origin and B is the point with x-coordinate 
—that is, the
lowest point on the cycloid in the first arc to the right of A. If the bead is re-
leased at any point between A and B, it can be shown that the time required for
it to reach B is always the same.
Variations of the cycloid occur in applications. For example, if a motor-
cycle wheel rolls along a straight road, then the curve traced by a fixed point
on one of the spokes is a cycloidlike curve. In this case the curve does not have
cusps, nor does it intersect the road (the x-axis) as does the graph of a cycloid.
If the wheel of a train rolls along a railroad track, then the curve traced by a
fixed point on the circumference of the wheel (which extends below the track)
contains loops at regular intervals. Other cycloids are defined in Exercises 39
and 40.

In a rectangular coordinate system, the ordered pair 
denotes the point
whose directed distances from the x- and y-axes are b and a, respectively. An-
other method for representing points is to use polar coordinates. We begin
with a fixed point O (the origin, or pole) and a directed half-line (the polar
axis) with endpoint O. Next we consider any point P in the plane different
from O. If, as illustrated in Figure 1,
and u denotes the measure
of any angle determined by the polar axis and OP, then r and u are polar co-
ordinates of P and the symbols 
or 
are used to denote P. As usual,
u is considered positive if the angle is generated by a counterclockwise rota-

tion of the polar axis and negative if the rotation is clockwise. Either radian or
degree measure may be used for u.
Figure 1
The polar coordinates of a point are not unique. For example,
and 
all represent the same point (see Figure 2). We
shall also allow r to be negative. In this case, instead of measuring 
units
along the terminal side of the angle u, we measure along the half-line with
endpoint O that has direction opposite that of the terminal side. The points
corresponding to the pairs 
and 
are also plotted in
Figure 2.
We agree that the pole O has polar coordinates 
for any u. An as-
signment of ordered pairs of the form 
to points in a plane is a polar co-
ordinate system, and the plane is an ru-plane.
Let us next superimpose an xy-plane on an ru-plane so that the positive 
x-axis coincides with the polar axis. Any point P in the plane may then be as-
signed rectangular coordinates 
or polar coordinates 
If 
we
have a situation similar to that illustrated in Figure 3(a); if 
we have that
shown in part (b) of the figure. In Figure 3(b), for later purposes, we have also

The following result specifies relationships between 
and 
where it is assumed that the positive x-axis coincides with the polar axis.
PROOFS
(1) Although we have pictured u as an acute angle in Figure 3, the discussion
that follows is valid for all angles.
If 
as in Figure 3(a), then 
and 
and
hence
If 
then 
and from Figure 3(b) we see that
Multiplication by r gives us relationship 1, and therefore these formulas
hold if r is either positive or negative.
If 
then the point is the pole, and we again see that the formulas
in (1) are true.

In this case we use

A polar equation is an equation in r and u. A solution of a polar equation
is an ordered pair 
that leads to equality if a is substituted for r and b for
u. The graph of a polar equation is the set of all points (in an ru-plane) that
correspond to the solutions.
The simplest polar equations are 
and 
where a is a nonzero
real number. Since the solutions of the polar equation 
are of the form
for any angle u, it follows that the graph is a circle of radius 
with
center at the pole. A graph for

is obtained for 
The solutions of the polar equation 
are of the form 
for any
real number r. Since the coordinate a (the angle) is constant, the graph of
is a line through the origin, as illustrated in Figure 7 for an acute angle a.
We may use the relationships between rectangular and polar coordinates
to transform a polar equation to an equation in x and y, and vice versa. This
procedure is illustrated in the next three examples.

have included a third row in the table that contains one-decimal-place approxi-

As an aid to plotting points in the ru-plane shown in Figure 10, we have
extended the polar axis in the negative direction and introduced a vertical line
through the pole (this line is the graph of the equation 
). Additional
points obtained by letting u vary from p to 2p lie on the same circle. For 
example, the solution 
gives us the same point as 
the

Plotting points in an ru-plane leads to the upper half of the graph sketched 
in Figure 11. (We have used polar coordinate graph paper, which displays 
lines through O at various angles and concentric circles with centers at the
pole.)

If u increases from p to 2p, then cos u increases from 1 to 1, and con-
sequently r increases from 0 to 4. Plotting points for

The same graph may be obtained by taking other intervals of length 2p

If a and b are not zero, then the graphs of the following polar equations
are limaçons:
Note that the special limaçons in which 
are cardioids.
Using the u-interval 
(or 
) is usually sufficient to graph
polar equations. For equations with more complex graphs, it is often helpful to
graph by using subintervals of 
that are determined by the u-values that
make 
—that is, the pole values. We will demonstrate this technique in the
next example.

The graph in Example 9 is a four-leafed rose. In general, a polar equation
of the form
or
for any positive integer n greater than 1 and any nonzero real number a has a
graph that consists of a number of loops through the origin. If n is even, there
are 2n loops, and if n is odd, there are n loops.
The graph of the polar equation 
for any nonzero real number a is
a spiral of Archimedes. The case 
is considered in the next example.

Sketching the graph of a spiral of Archimedes

SOLUT ION
The graph consists of all points that have polar coordinates of
the form 
for every real number 
Thus, the graph contains the
points 
and so on. As u increases, r increases at the
same rate, and the spiral winds around the origin in a counterclockwise direc-
tion, intersecting the polar axis at 
as illustrated in Figure 15.
If u is allowed to be negative, then as u decreases through negative values,
the resulting spiral winds around the origin and is the symmetric image, with
respect to the vertical axis, of the curve sketched in Figure 15.
L
If we superimpose an xy-plane on an ru-plane, then the graph of a polar
equation may be symmetric with respect to the x-axis (the polar axis), the
y-axis (the line 
), or the origin (the pole). Some typical symmetries
are illustrated in Figure 16. The next result summarizes these symmetries.

To illustrate, since 
the graph of the polar equation
in Example 8 is symmetric with respect to the polar axis, by
test 1. Since 
the graph in Example 6 is symmetric with
respect to the line 
by test 2. The graph of the four-leafed rose in Ex-
ample 9 is symmetric with respect to the polar axis, the line 
and the
pole. Other tests for symmetry may be stated; however, those we have listed
are among the easiest to apply.
Unlike the graph of an equation in x and y, the graph of a polar equation
can be symmetric with respect to the polar axis, the line 
or
the pole without satisfying one of the preceding tests for symmetry. This is true
because of the many different ways of specifying a point in polar coordinates.
Another difference between rectangular and polar coordinate systems is
that the points of intersection of two graphs cannot always be found by solv-
ing the polar equations simultaneously. To illustrate, from Example 6, the
graph of 
is a circle of diameter 4 with center at 
(see Fig-
ure 17). Similarly, the graph of 
is a circle of diameter 4 with cen-
ter at 
on the polar axis. Referring to Figure 17, we see that the
coordinates of the point of intersection 
in quadrant I satisfy both
equations; however, the origin O, which is on each circle, cannot be found by

solving the equations simultaneously. Thus, in searching for points of inter-
section of polar graphs, it is sometimes necessary to refer to the graphs them-
selves, in addition to solving the two equations simultaneously.
An alternative method is to use different (equivalent) equations for the
graphs. See Discussion Exercise 12 at the end of the chapter.

The following theorem combines the definitions of parabola, ellipse, and hy-
perbola into a unified description of the conic sections. The constant e in the
statement of the theorem is the eccentricity of the conic. The point F is a focus
of the conic, and the line l is a directrix. Possible positions of F and l are il-
lustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1
PROOF
If 
then 
and, by definition, the resulting
conic is a parabola with focus F and directrix l.
Suppose next that 
It is convenient to introduce a polar coordi-
nate system in the plane with F as the pole and l perpendicular to the polar axis
at the point 
with 
as illustrated in Figure 2. If 
is a point
in the plane such that 
then P lies to the left of l. Let
C be the projection of P on the polar axis. Since
and
it follows that P satisfies the condition in the theorem if and only if the fol-
lowing are true:

Polar Equations of Conics
Theorem on Conics
Let F be a fixed point and l a fixed line in a plane. The set of all points P in
the plane, such that the ratio 
is a positive constant e with
the distance from P to l, is a conic section. The conic is a parabola

The same equations are obtained if 
however, there is no point

the graph if 
An equation in x and y corresponding to 
is
Squaring both sides and rearranging terms leads to
Completing the square and simplifying, we obtain
Finally, dividing both sides by 
gives us an equation of the form
with 
Consequently, the graph is an ellipse with center at
the point 
on the x-axis and with
Since
we obtain 
and hence 
This proves that F is a focus
of the ellipse. It also follows that 
A similar proof may be given for
the case 
L
We also can show that every conic that is not degenerate may be described
by means of the statement in the theorem on conics. This gives us a formula-
tion of conic sections that is equivalent to the one used previously. Since the
theorem includes all three types of conics, it is sometimes regarded as a defi-
nition for the conic sections.
If we had chosen the focus F to the right of the directrix, as illustrated in
Figure 3 (with 
), then the equation 
would have re-
sulted. (Note the minus sign in place of the plus sign.) Other sign changes
occur if d is allowed to be negative.
If we had taken l parallel to the polar axis through one of the points
or 
as illustrated in Figure 4, then the corresponding equa-
tions would have contained 
instead of cos 	.

Sketching the graph of a polar equation of an ellipse
Describe and sketch the graph of the polar equation

We first divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction
by 3 to obtain the constant term 1 in the denominator:
This equation has one of the forms in the preceding theorem, with 
Thus, the graph is an ellipse with focus F at the pole and major axis along the
polar axis. We find the endpoints of the major axis by letting 
and 
This gives us the points 
and 
Hence,

The center of the ellipse is the midpoint 
of the segment 
Using the
fact that 
we obtain
Hence,
Thus,
The graph is sketched in Figure 5. For reference, we have su-

Sketching the graph of a polar equation of a hyperbola
Describe and sketch the graph of the polar equation
SOLUT ION
To express the equation in the proper form, we divide the nu-
merator and denominator of the fraction by 2:
Thus,
and, by the theorem on polar equations of conics, the graph is a
hyperbola with a focus at the pole. The expression 
tells us that the trans-
verse axis of the hyperbola is perpendicular to the polar axis. To find the ver-
tices, we let 
and 
in the given equation. This gives us the
points 
and 
Hence,
or
The points 
and 
on the graph can be used to sketch the lower
branch of the hyperbola. The upper branch is obtained by symmetry, as illus-
trated in Figure 6. If we desire more accuracy or additional information, we
calculate
and
Asymptotes may then be constructed in the usual way.

Note that there is no point on the graph corresponding to 
since the de-
nominator 
is 0 for that value. Plotting the three points and using the
fact that the graph is a parabola with focus at the pole gives us the sketch in
Figure 7.
L
If we desire only a rough sketch of a conic, then the technique employed
in Example 3 is recommended. To use this method, we plot (if possible) points
corresponding to 
and 
These points, together with the
type of conic (obtained from the value of the eccentricity e), readily lead to
the sketch.

27 No. If i is a root, then 
is also a root. Hence, the
polynomial would have factors 
,
,
,
and therefore would be of degree greater than 3.
29 Since n is odd and nonreal complex zeros occur in
conjugate pairs for polynomials with real coefficients,
there must be at least one real zero.
