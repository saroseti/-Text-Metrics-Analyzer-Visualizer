Preface to the Second Edition
Mathematics is the science which studies structures and relations among structures.
The “truth” (whatever it means) in Mathematics is established by rigorous deductions
made in an appropriately chosen frame described by axioms and deﬁnitions. Self-
consistency is the ﬁrst requirement which any mathematical result should satisfy.
Sometimes, in Mathematics, theorems are formulated about space and changes of
structures involving the space which becomes a language for models in Physics.
The language of Relativity is the Differential Geometry, and our road to Relativity
depends on it. In other words, while Geometry is often used to formulate theories of
Physics, in General Relativity, Geometry coincides with Physics and a modern trend
is that all Physics could coincide with Geometry. The aim of this Second Edition is to
improve both the content and the style we present in this language. Therefore the two
chapters dedicated to Differential Geometry are completely changed. We insist on
the natural transfer of geometric structures between the ambient space and surfaces
belonging to it. We present more examples and simplify the proofs of theorems.
More exercises are solved considering students who need to understand the basic
techniques of Differential Geometry in view of applications to Physics. The aim is
taking into account the Einstein point of view: “As far as the laws of Mathematics
refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer
to reality.” Therefore the reader can realize that modeling Physics does not mean to
describe the Reality in its deep meaning but only represent some features of Reality
which can be studied by the self-consistency of the models as well as probed by
experiments and observations validating or discarding such features.
The road passing through Differential Geometry allows us to step to Relativity
after we proved the Bianchi second formula. It is why we succeeded in less than
80 pages to develop a chapter called “Differential Geometry at Work. Two Ways
of Thinking the Gravity”.... We ﬁnd out how to simply deduce the Einstein ﬁeld
equations.
At the same time, the road we took allows to understand, in the next chapter, how
models of Euclidean, Non-Euclidean and Elliptic geometries can be deduced from
Geometry and Physics points of view. Yes, you read correctly, from Physics, the
Physics related, for example, to Special Relativity.

Preface to the Second Edition
There are changes inside almost each chapter of the First Edition, because we
think to offer more information about FLRW universes and the dimensions of our
observable Universe. Also if it is hard to believe, it is possible to prove that FLRW
universes depend on the geometries of Gaussian constant curvature. Therefore such
universes are created starting two dimensional metrics which describe Euclidean,
Non-Euclidean and Elliptic geometries. In particular, we discuss some special exact
solutions of Einstein ﬁeld equations describing exotic space-times without matter,
time and having the “geometric texture” shacked by planar gravitational waves.
Finally, without claim of completeness, we give simple examples of black holes,
wormholes or cosmic strings with the aim to show how Mathematics can be powerful
in imagining the World. If in the First Edition we have presented the de Sitter universe,
nowweenlargetheapproachpresentinguniverseswithoutmatterandtime.Adetailed
discussion is given for the Anti-de Sitter universe. We explained how the cosmolog-
ical constant of de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space-times depends on the afﬁne radius
of the Minkowski spheres which appear in the landscape description.
In order to improve the Differential Geometry tools, we presented differentiable
manifolds, differential forms, structure equations, vector ﬁelds, afﬁne connections,
covariant derivatives induced by afﬁne connections, torsion, curvature, parallel trans-
port and geodesics. The aim is presenting concepts of Differential Geometry which
can exist even without a metric. Setting a metric compatible with a connection means
to consider only a speciﬁc connection, the so called Levi Civita connection.
In some sense, we return to the Differential Geometry presented in the previous
chapters of the book, but we open the road to the Metric-Afﬁne Gravity. An entire
chapter is devoted to this topic and an entire section prepares the basic notations and
notions necessary to understand it.
In this second edition, we added more ﬁgures and took care of observations and
suggestions received from students and colleagues, trying to write an improved text
suitable for all the audience.

Preface I to the First Edition
This book is an approach to Special and General Relativity from a full mathematical
pointofview.WhenPhysicsisstudied,thereistheneedofunderstandingitslanguage,
that is Mathematics. Dirac’s words describe very well what we want to do: “God
used beautiful Mathematics in creating the world,” therefore we present a part of
this divine plan, the beautiful Mathematics of Special and General Relativity. We
wrote a textbook which, we believe, can be easily used by students in Mathematics,
Physics, and Engineering studies. By teachers or by some other people who are
interested in this subject. If someone already knows Mathematics, that is both basic
Geometry and Differential Geometry, this person can neglect the ﬁrst six chapters.
She/he can start from Gravity in Newtonian Mechanics. People who study Physics
should start from the very beginning in order to understand the development of
Geometry. The improvement of mathematical language, in more than 2000 and 500
years, allowed to produce a common language for both Calculus and Linear Algebra:
this approach ends up to a dialect, the Differential Geometry, which constitutes the
basic tool of Relativity. Without the effort to understand the nature of the Non-
Euclidean Geometry, the Differential Geometry could not occur. Without Differential
Geometry, General Relativity could not exist. The ﬁrst six chapters represent the
adventure of Geometry from axioms until the Non-Euclidean Geometries through
Differential Geometry. A lot of examples and solved exercises help the reader to
understand the theory. Actually, the entire book, which is written in a unitary way,
offers clear statements and proofs. About the proofs: it offers complete proofs and
all computations are presented. In our opinion, this is the only way to understand
the complicated computations which depend on the Differential Geometry language.
Reading line by line, the reader can understand every single proof. The references
which inspired us are mentioned at the beginning of each chapter, but also in the text.
Some proofs and some approaches of the theory are completely original. If somebody
is reading from the beginning to the end of this book, it becomes understandable why
each subject presented is important for the topic. We hope that our humble efforts are
useful, ﬁrst of all, for learning people who this book is mainly dedicated. We thank
our colleagues, our teachers, our friends and, ﬁrst of all, our students whose questions,
discussions, and remarks allowed us to enter the perfect world of Geometry towards

its amazing realization which is General Relativity. We want to thank also Dr. Marina
Forlizzi and the Springer staff for invaluable support in publishing this book.
As a ﬁnal remark, we want to say that this book was conceived about 2 years
ago during pleasant discussions on Mathematics and General Relativity in scientiﬁc
congresses and meetings between the authors and was concluded during the severe
period of the global Coronavirus disease. We hope that Science and its high values
can be comforting even in difﬁcult situations like the present one, as happened so
many times in history.

Preface II to the First Edition
What does a mathematical journey towards the general theory of Relativity look like?
The authors propose an original itinerary moving from Euclidean and non-Euclidean
Geometry created from axioms, to models of geometric Euclidean and non-Euclidean
worlds. Differential Geometry of surfaces and then abstract Differential Geometry
are special stops for two reasons:
1. To understand non-Euclidean Geometry models from this point of view;
2. To create the language by which we can describe the General Relativity and its
consequences.
The physical world allows both Euclidean and non-Euclidean descriptions. To have
an image of this physical world we need to continue the itinerary with supplementary
stops: Newtonian and Lagrangian Mechanics, Special Relativity to reach, ﬁnally,
General Relativity.
The content of the book is written to be self-contained. All the proofs are done with
all the details presented for the reader. The problems are solved, or they have hints.
Almost all the contents were presented to students at different university courses and,
in our experience, they were well received.
In Chap. 1, we present, using a slightly modiﬁed Hilbert’s axioms system,
Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries and what they mean. Here, the mathemat-
ical theory is built from a set of primary objects, which do not require deﬁnitions,
together with a set of axioms. The collection of primary objects is chosen from the
set theory. The axioms are stated in a formal form and the axiomatic theory is built
as a collection of mathematically rigorous statements deduced from the axioms.
It exists a common part for Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometry, the so-called
Absolute Geometry. Absolute Geometry consists in all the results that can be thought
and proved using the axiomatic system before introducing a Parallelism Axiom. The
main theorem in Absolute Geometry is the Legendre one, which states that the sum
of measures of angles of a given triangle is less than or equal to two right angles.
xiii
xiv
Preface II to the First Edition
The two consequences are:
1. The sum of angles in each triangle is equal to two right angles.
2. The sum of angles in each triangle is strictly less than two right angles.
A further axiom, the Parallelism Axiom, makes us to discover the Euclidean world,
corresponding to the ﬁrst case, i.e. the sum of angles is equal to two right angles.
The denial of the previous Parallelism Axiom leads us to the Non-Euclidean
Geometry; here the sum of angles is strictly less than two right angles.
Euclidean Geometry and Non-Euclidean geometries are the frameworks where
formulate Newtonian Mechanics and Relativity respectively, as we will see later.
Chapter 2 highlights how the Euclidean Geometry, previously introduced, can
be constructed and viewed using algebra and trigonometry. All happens in a two-
dimensional vector space endowed with an inner product invariant with respect to the
group of Euclidean rotations. Basic facts on Euclidean Geometry are presented, the
most important being Pythagoras Theorem and the generalized Pythagoras theorems.
Even if it seems there is no connection between Minkowski Plane Geometry
and the geometries created from the axiomatic point of view, we present in detail the
Minkowski Plane Geometry. The construction is related to the same two-dimensional
vector space used to describe Euclidean Geometry, but instead of the Euclidean
inner product, we have a Minkowski product. There exists a group of hyperbolic
rotations which leaves invariant the Minkowski product. Minkowski Geometry is
not as simple as Euclidean Geometry. There are space-like vectors, null vectors, and
time-like vectors. Minkowski–Pythagoras Theorem has different statements with
respect to the type of the involved side-vectors of the triangle. Even if in this chapter
we construct an algebraic image of the Euclidean Geometry, we have not yet images
about the Non-Euclidean Geometry. The next chapters deal with this issue.
Chapter 3 is dedicated to the tools we need to construct a ﬁrst model of Non-
Euclidean Geometry. This model is constructed in the interior disk of a given circle.
To be constructed, we need to understand the geometric inversion and basic
facts about Projective Geometry. A projective invariant of a special projective map,
attached to the previous given circle, allows us to construct a distance inside the disk
of the circle. The Poincaré disk model is highlighted.
The “lines”, that is the geodesic lines of this distance, are orthogonal arcs of circles
to the given circle. It is easy to see that there are more than two non-intersecting
“lines” through a given point with respect to a given “line”. The sum of angles of a
triangle in this Poincaré model is of course less than pi.
Chapter 4 is related to the Differential Geometry of surfaces. In the ﬁrst part, the
surfaces are seen as subsets of a 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In this context, we
understand how the Euclidean inner product of the Euclidean space induces a way to
measure lengths and angles for vectors belonging to the tangent planes of the surface.
We can also measure the length of curves that belong to surfaces, areas of regions,
and all these using the metric attached to the surface.
The Differential Geometry of a surface continues by introducing a fundamental
notion: the Gaussian Curvature of a surface at a point. If, at the beginning, the
Gaussian Curvature seems to be dependent on the fact that the surface is seen in the
Preface II to the First Edition
xv
Euclidean ambient space, after we prove Gauss’ formulas, we step into the intrinsic
theory of surfaces. There, Gauss’ equations and Theorema Egregium offer another
perspective: each surface can be seen as a piece of a plane endowed with a metric,
and this metric only determines the curvature.
The study continues in Minkowski three-spaces where we have to take care of the
Minkowski-type nature of the normal vector to the surface. However, we have almost
the same picture, the Minkowski product determines a non-Euclidean metric of a
surface which allows us to conclude about the intrinsic Geometry of it. Therefore,
in both cases the surface becomes irrelevant for our study. In fact, we study the
Geometry of a metric and obtain relevant geometric aspects about the piece of plane
endowed with that metric.
The covariant derivative introduced in the last part of the chapter allows us to
deﬁne the parallel transport and the geodesics of surfaces. At the end of the chapter
we introduce a short story about a person embedded in a surface with the aim to reveal
how the person can develop a theory about its universe, which is the surface where
he lives. The study is continuing in the next chapter, when we better understand the
nature of geometric objects which appear in Differential Geometry.
Chapter 5 is fundamental for the book: the ﬁnal image about the Non-Euclidean
Geometries cannot be given without what we learn here. Basic Differential Geom-
etry is about Differential Geometry when an extra dimension does not exist. In the
previous chapter, we claimed that we did not know yet the mathematical nature of
the multi-index quantities which appear in the Differential Geometry of surfaces. In
this chapter we prove the tensor character of the metric coefﬁcients, of the Riemann
symbols, of the Ricci symbols, and also for the geodesics equations. All these multi-
index quantities remain invariant when we deal with a change of coordinates. Why
this is important? The substance of General Relativity is related to these changes of
coordinates. A change of coordinates may reﬂect an acceleration ﬁeld which is equiv-
alent to a gravitational ﬁeld and, in the context described, a nice example developed
later is about the constant gravitational ﬁeld.
The covariant derivative for contravariant vectors, which appears as a geometric
property, allows us to think of a general deﬁnition for the covariant derivative of
tensors. How we parallel transport vectors along curves, how geodesic lines appear,
and some other important properties of parallel transport of vectors along geodesic
lines are also studied. At the end of the chapter, the covariant derivation of Einstein’s
tensor allows the reader to have a ﬁrst image on Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.
Chapter 6 is devoted to Non-Euclidean Geometry models and their physical inter-
pretation. It is worth stressing that we are dealing with models and not only with a
model. In fact, we imagine some other models of Non-Euclidean Geometry. There
are some steps before providing these models. Differential Geometry gives us the
possibility to see:
– how distances of the models produce the metrics;
– how the geodesics of the distances are also the geodesics of the metrics;
– how the models are related among them through their metrics according to
convenient changes of coordinates.
xvi
Preface II to the First Edition
It is important to stress that all these models are equivalent and contribute to the
big picture. Speciﬁcally, the Poincaré disk model, the Poincaré half-plane model, the
exterior disk model, the hemisphere model, and the hyperboloid models are studied
and presented.
The ﬁrst three models are connected among them by geometric inversions. The
remaining models need appropriate changes of coordinates to connect them to the
ﬁrst three. In particular, the hyperboloid model is described by a Minkowski metric.
At this point, we have the ﬁrst connection between Non-Euclidean Geometry and
Minkowski Geometry. Next, in the Eighth Chapter devoted to Special Relativity, a
Minkowski-type metric appears giving a geometric image of the (so called) physical
reality [1].
The physical example, developed at the end of the chapter, is due to Poincaré. The
question is: Can we develop the Poincaré disk model starting from simple physical
rules? The answer is yes and this is possible combining Physics and Geometry. Even
if Poincaré developed the model stating that reality cannot be fully understood, after
this example, it is easy to accept the fact that the Geometry is related to the Relativity
description. In fact Non-Euclidean Geometry, seen through Differential Geometry,
is needed to understand basic facts of General Relativity, as we see later.
Euclidean Geometry constitutes the framework of the Newtonian Mechanics.
Chapter 7 is dedicated to understand how forces can explain what is happening in
our surrounding world modelled into a three-dimensional Euclidean Space where
only one clock gives the universal time. In this sense, the Newtonian Mechanics
reveals an absolute space and an absolute time [2].
It is described the gravitational force together with the gravitational ﬁeld. A math-
ematical artefact, the gravitational potential, is involved in two fundamental results:
the vacuum ﬁeld equation and the gravitational ﬁeld equation. Looking at these equa-
tions and how difﬁcult we mathematically obtained them, somebody can think that
this is the maximum we can say about the gravitational ﬁeld. But the tidal forces and
the tidal acceleration equations offer another perspective. The vacuum ﬁeld equa-
tion is encapsulated in the trace of the Hessian matrix involved in tidal acceleration
equations.
If we try to obtain the geometric equivalent of these equations in a curved space,
that is if we cancel out the Euclidean 3-dimensional space, the Hessian matrix is
replaced by a curvature-dependent tensor whose trace is the Ricci symbol. In the
future, we prove via Fermi coordinates, that this is a possible way to obtain Einstein’s
vacuum ﬁeld equations. This is the ﬁrst geometric change of the Euclidean frame
when one studies forces.
This situation may arise another important change of perspective.
Suppose we have a force and the trajectories of a point subjected to this force. Is
it possible to locally ﬁnd a metric whose geodesics are the previous trajectories? The
answer is yes. The Euler–Lagrange equations become the equations of the previous
trajectories and the same Euler–Lagrange equations are the geodesic equations of a
metric induced by another mathematical artefact called Lagrangian.
The study of the Lagrangian, starting from the mechanical one, is made through a
functional called action. If the ﬁrst-order variation of the action vanishes, we obtain
Preface II to the First Edition
xvii
the Euler–Lagrange equations. Later, we prove how another action, the Hilbert action,
allows us to derive the Einstein ﬁeld equations in General Relativity.
Kepler’s laws are also studied in this chapter with the aim to prepare the reader
understanding of planet trajectories in a metric, of course, later, in the part related to
General Relativity.
Chapter 8 is devoted to Special Relativity. Reﬂection and refraction of light were
explained in a satisfactory way by Newton who looks at light rays as trajectories of
particles (after called photons).
In the middle of XIXth century, James Clark Maxwell offered another view: the
light is an electromagnetic wave and it satisﬁes four equations, known as Maxwell’s
equations of the Electromagnetism. If we try to put them in accordance with Newton’s
theory, it appears the necessity of considering a medium in which the electromagnetic
waves travel through space. It was called by physicists of that time the ether.
Ernst Mach’s did not agree with the idea of ether and observed the necessity of
the revision of all fundamental concepts of Physics [2].
Michelson–Morley experiment, who initially was designed to reveal the ether,
had a result completely different with respect to the expectations. Albert Einstein
explained the result of the experiment in a theory where he revised in a fundamental
way the ideas of space and time, and no place for ether remained. The absolute space
and the absolute time of the Newtonian mechanics were replaced by the speciﬁc space
and the speciﬁc time of each observer. Different observers mean different inertial
frames of coordinates, each one having its time axis and its space axes [3].
Einstein formulated the Special Relativity starting from two main postulates:
1. The laws of Physics has to be the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The speed of light in vacuum, denoted by c, is the same for all the observers and
it is the maximum speed reached by a moving object.
Presenting the theory, we preferred to balance it starting from two important works,
the book by Callahan, [4], and a paper by Varićak [5], where we found the most
possible geometric approach to Special Relativity.
Therefore we have adapted, in a new form, the basic ideas discussed there. The
ﬁrst idea is related to the consideration of two inertial frames of coordinates, one
moving at a constant speed, another considered at rest, in which the two observers
have to agree on the same laws of Physics [4]. In this way, the old Galilean trans-
formations of coordinates are replaced by the Lorentz transformations. There are
a lot of consequences: another formula for velocity addition, the time dilation, the
length contraction, the covariance of Maxwell’s law under Lorentz transformation,
the rest-energy formula, the Doppler effect, and so on. The second one is related to
the geometric understanding of these facts: we have a sort of equivalence between
the so-called “geometric coordinates” and the “physical coordinates” [5]. The entity
called “physical space-time” is understood through the geometric space-time where
the results are easier to be viewed. This idea can be originally seen in [3].
Then, when we introduce a constant gravitational ﬁeld via the accelerated frames,
(see also [4] point of view) we can prove the bending of the light rays; the interpreta-
tion of the Doppler gravitational effect shows that accelerated frames are not inertial
xviii
Preface II to the First Edition
ones. Much more: a contradiction between the Minkowski ﬂat space-time of Special
Relativity and the gravitational Doppler effect occurs. A physical theory containing
the old Mechanics, including gravity, and the modern electromagnetic waves theory
needs to integrate the accelerated frames. In this way, we can add another argument
towards the General Relativity.
Chapter 9 is devoted to General Relativity and Relativistic Cosmology. There is no
other better description of the subject than the sentence by John Archibald Wheeler:
“Space-time tells matter how to move; matter tells space-time how to curve” [6],
[7]. How the space is curved appears from the Einstein ﬁeld equations

In the left-hand side we have “Geometry,” a metric g Subscript i j and its derivatives are involved;
in the right-hand side we have a tensor depending on matter, the so-called energy-
momentum tensor. The energy-momentum tensor establishes the metric, the metric
produces geodesics described by the equations

They are trajectories of objects moving according to the Geometry of space-time.
Therefore, the geodesic equations are the equivalent equations of curves which satisfy

The equations of geodesics of an initial metric switch accordingly to a change of
coordinates into the equations of the geodesics of the new obtained metric. Changes
of coordinates may provide a new state of a given frame, therefore the new state
is described by a new metric provided by the old state metric via the coordinates
change. The reader will understand how it works looking at the case of the constant
gravitational ﬁeld. However, after a change of coordinates, the metric of space-time
remains the same being a tensor.
The chapter starts looking at the differences between the classical Newtonian
Mechanics and Einstein’s landscape of gravity described by Geometry. Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations can be derived from the Hilbert action. A generalization of such an
action, the so-called f  left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis gravity is also presented. The straightforward solution, in
the case of vacuum ﬁeld equations for spherical symmetry, is Schwarzschild’s one.
We present computations related to the orbits of planets and the bending of light rays.
Fermi’s viewpoint on Einstein’s vacuum ﬁeld equations allows to obtain the clas-
sical counterparts of the relativistic equations in the case of the weak gravitational
ﬁeld.
After, we analyse the Einstein static universe and the basic considerations on the
cosmological constant, as a part of the classical approach to the General Relativity.
Preface II to the First Edition
xix
A “metric for the Universe” is obtained for the cosmic expansion. It is the
Friedman–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric. The way we obtain it is related to
the energy-momentum tensor and the Cosmological Principle.
Black holes are an important prediction of General Relativity. We propose an
introduction to their theory starting from the Rindler metric. The singularities which
can be removed using Rindler’s idea are geometric only. Schwarzschild metric is
important in the study of black holes. The anomalies of black holes are explained
via Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates and light cones inside and outside black holes are
presented.
Another important prediction, the existence of gravitational waves, is discussed in
thischaptertogiveamorecompletepictureofthephysicallandscapeofGeneralRela-
tivity. Furthermore, cosmic strings are presented as a hypothetical structure consid-
ered, until now, only as a possible solution to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. Another
important solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations is the GModifyingAbove normal o With two dotsdel’s, who succeeded to
prove that a homogeneous universe without a global time coordinate can theoreti-
cally exist. We present the above solutions with all the details necessary to be easily
understood at the undergraduate student level.
In Chap. 10, as a full geometric realization of Relativity, we present the so-
called Afﬁne Universe and the de Sitter space-time. From a cosmological point of
view, this solution is fundamental to discuss, at an elementary level, the problems
of primordial inﬂation and the late accelerated behaviour, often dubbed as dark
energy. Starting from two different parameterizations, it is possible to describe the
cosmological constant, the main ingredient of de Sitter solution. Essentially, it is
possible to show that a curved universe can be achieved without a mass distribution.
A possible explanation can be obtained starting from a Minkowski space-time where
gravitational ﬁeld (without masses) is considered. In this sense, this is a full geometric
realization of Relativity.

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean 
Geometries: How They Appear 
Omnibus ex nihilo ducendis sufﬁcit unum. 
G. W. von Leibniz 
We intend to construct these geometries using a slightly modiﬁed Hilbert’s axioms 
system in the same way as it is done in [ 36, 37, 138, 185]. An interesting thing is 
related to the fact that it exists as a common part for Euclidean and non-Euclidean 
Geometry, the so-called Absolute Geometry. Roughly speaking, the Absolute Geom-
etry consists in all theorems that can be thought and proved using the axiomatic 
system before introducing a parallelism axiom. 
In our vision, the most important theorem in Absolute Geometry is the Legendre 
one: 
“The sum of angles of a triangle is less than or equal two right angles.” 
It allows us to prove that only two situations hold: 
“The sum of angles in each triangle is equal to two right angles.” 
or, the other situation: 
“The sum of angles in each triangle is strictly less than two right angles” 
Choosing an appropriate parallelism axiom we discover the Euclidean world, 
corresponding to the ﬁrst case, i.e. the sum of angles is equal to two right angles. 
The denial of the previous parallelism axiom leads us to the non-Euclidean geometry; 
here the sum of angles is strictly less than two right angles. We have used few ﬁgures 
to illustrate these concepts, because the reader can remain with a false image about 
how lines look like. However, in Absolute Geometry, the reader can think and draw 
images as in the Euclidean geometry, because all the objects and all the theorems 
valid in absolute geometry are also valid in Euclidean Geometry. Here the lines 
are the ordinary straight lines of the plane. The images can be thought in a more 
complicated way if someone try to imagine them in a model for the non-Euclidean

geometry, because lines can look like arcs of circles, segments, etc. All the proofs are 
reported in such a way that they can be understood by reading them directly. 
1.1 
Absolute Geometry 
The key idea of the axiomatic method is to build a theory from a set of primary 
objects, which do not require deﬁnitions, together with a set of axioms. Therefore 
the theory is built as a collection of mathematically rigorous statements deduced 
from the axioms. 
The collection of primary objects of the geometry is given in the following, inher-
ited from set theory. The objects of the ﬁrst collection are called points, and they are 
denoted by capital lettersupper A comma upper B comma upper C comma ellipsisA, B, C, . . . The second collection contains lines , denoted 
byl comma l prime comma ellipsisl,l,, . . . The third collection contains planes, denoted by Greek lettersalpha comma beta comma gamma comma ellipsisα, β, γ, . . .
Finally, the last collection contains only one element called space, denoted by upper SS. 
The ﬁrst important group of axioms is related to the incidence of the objects 
described above. They describe who belongs to who, which set of objects can be 
included in which, how many objects are necessary to create another object, etc. Let 
us introduce the so-called “axioms of incidence”. 
The ﬁrst axiom which helps us to construct a geometry establishes the existence 
and uniqueness of a line and its connection with two given distinct points. 
Axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 1 Baseline colonI1 : For any two distinct points upper AA and upper BB there exists a unique linell which 
is incident with both upper AA and upper BB, i.e. upper A element of lA ∈l and upper B element of lB ∈l. 
The unique line ll of the previous axiom is often denoted by upper A upper BAB, indicating that 
it is the line that passes through the points upper AA and upper BB. 
Axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 2 Baseline colonI2 : There exist at least two distinct points on any line. Moreover, there 
exist at least three distinct points which are not on the same line. 
In view of the axiom, it seems useful to be able to distinguish between points 
which are on a line from points which do not belong to the same line, therefore we 
introduce the following notion. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.1 Any number of points are called collinear if there is a line which 
is incident to all of them. Otherwise, they are called non-collinear . 
For example, axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 1I1 asserts that every two distinct points are collinear, and 
axiombold upper I Subscript bold 2I2 guarantees the existence of at least three non-collinear points in the geom-
etry we are constructing. The next two axioms establish the relationship between 
points and planes. 
Axiombold upper I Subscript bold 3 Baseline colonI3 : For any three arbitrary non-collinear distinct pointsupper AA,upper BB andupper CC, there 
exists an unique plane alphaα which contains upper AA, upper BB, and upper CC.
1.1 Absolute Geometry
3
In general, such a plane is denoted by alpha colon equals left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesisα := (ABC). 
The following axiom establishes the relationship among points on a given line 
and a plane containing that line. This axiom plays a crucial role once we construct 
geometries with more number of points and lines. 
Axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 4I4 : If two points upper AA and upper BB, which determine the line ll, lie in the plane alphaα, 
then every point of the line ll lies in the plane alphaα. 
In this case, we writel subset of alphal ⊂α (regarded as a subset of points). The following axiom 
states that the minimum number of points in an intersection of two planes is two. 
Axiombold upper I Subscript bold 5I5 : If two planesalphaα and betaβ have a common point upper AA, then they have another 
common point upper BB distinct from upper AA. 
An immediate consequence of axiomsbold upper I Subscript bold 4I4 andbold upper I Subscript bold 5I5 is that if the planesalphaα andbetaβ con-
tain the two distinct points upper AA and upper BB, then they contain the whole line l equals upper A upper Bl = AB, and 
we write alpha intersection beta equals StartSet l EndSetα ∩β = {l}, again as an equality of sets of points. 
The last axiom of incidence states the minimum number of points necessary to 
create the space. 
Axiombold upper I Subscript bold 6I6 : There exist at least four points which do not belong to the same plane. 
In the view of this last axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 6I6, we give the following. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.2 Any number of points are called coplanar if there is a plane which 
passes through all of them. Otherwise, they are called non-coplanar. 
Axiomsbold upper I Subscript bold 1 Baseline minus bold upper I Subscript bold 6I1 −I6 give rise to a simple model of a space created only with 4 points, 
6 lines, and 4 planes. 
The model described above can be written as follows. The distinct points are 
upper A comma upper B comma upper C comma upper DA, B, C, D, and the six lines are given by the following sets of points:l Subscript upper A upper B Baseline equals StartSet upper A comma upper B EndSetlAB = {A, B}, 
l Subscript upper A upper C Baseline equals StartSet upper A comma upper C EndSetlAC = {A, C},l Subscript upper B upper C Baseline equals StartSet upper B comma upper C EndSetlBC = {B, C},l Subscript upper B upper D Baseline equals StartSet upper B comma upper D EndSetlBD = {B, D},l Subscript upper C upper D Baseline equals StartSet upper C comma upper D EndSetlC D = {C, D}, andl Subscript upper A upper D Baseline equals StartSet upper A comma upper D EndSetlAD = {A, D}. The  
four planes are left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesis equals StartSet upper A comma upper B comma upper C EndSet comma left parenthesis upper A upper B upper D right parenthesis equals StartSet upper A comma upper B comma upper D EndSet comma left parenthesis upper A upper C upper D right parenthesis equals StartSet upper A comma upper C comma upper D EndSet comma left parenthesis upper B upper C upper D right parenthesis equals StartSet upper B comma upper C comma upper D EndSet(ABC) = {A, B, C}, (ABD) = {A, B, D}, (AC D) = {A, C, D},
(BC D) = {B, C, D}, and the space built by Axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 6I6 is by deﬁnition left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C upper D right parenthesis(ABC D). 
We study below some immediate consequences of the group of six axioms of 
incidence. Notice that the results we prove below make sense even when applied to 
the simple model described above. 
Theorem 1.1.3 Two distinct lines have at most one common point. 
Proof Let l 1 comma l 2l1,l2 be two distinct lines. We distinguish the following two cases. If 
l 1 intersection l 2 equals normal empty setl1 ∩l2 = ∅, then they have no point in common, therefore the conclusion of the 
theorem is true.
4

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: How They Appear
If l 1 intersection l 2 not equals normal empty setl1 ∩l2 /= ∅, then let upper A element of l 1 intersection l 2A ∈l1 ∩l2 be a point in their intersection. We assume, by 
contradiction, that there is another point upper B element of l 1 intersection l 2B ∈l1 ∩l2, upper B not equals upper AB /= A. In particular, upper A comma upper B element of l 1A, B ∈
l1, therefore l 1 equals upper A upper Bl1 = AB (axiom bold upper I Subscript 1I1). Similarly, upper A comma upper B element of l 2A, B ∈l2, therefore l 2 equals upper A upper Bl2 = AB. Axiom 
bold upper I Subscript bold 1I1 says then that upper A upper B equals l 1 equals l 2AB = l1 = l2, in contradiction with the hypothesis that l 1 not equals l 2l1 /= l2. 
Therefore, our assumption on the existence of a different point upper B element of l 1 intersection l 2B ∈l1 ∩l2 is false. 
In conclusion, upper AA is the only common point of the two lines l 1l1 and l 2l2.
▢
The previous theorem motivates the following: 
Deﬁnition 1.1.4 Two distinct lines that intersect in exactly one point are called 
secant lines. 
The “Axioms of Order” deal with the undeﬁned yet relation of betweenness, i.e. of 
a point lying between two other points. Once the axioms of order appear, the previous 
very simple model of geometry fails to exist. The axioms of order are formulated as 
follows. 
Axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 1O1 : If a point upper BB is between upper AA and upper CC, then upper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C are three distinct 
collinear points on a line ll, and upper BB is between upper CC and upper AA. 
Imagine the line as a circle. The previous axiom tells us that such an image is 
not possible. The linell has no predeﬁned “orientation”. The only correct concept of 
order among points is deﬁned to be “between”. 
Axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 2O2 : For every pair of distinct points upper AA and upper BB, there is at least another 
distinct point upper CC such that upper BB is between upper AA and upper CC. 
An immediate consequence of axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 2O2, combined with axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 2I2, is that a line 
contains at least three points. The axiom can be applied again to the pair StartSet upper A comma upper C EndSet{A, C}, so  
there exists another point upper DD such that upper CC is between upper AA and upper DD, etc.  
Axiombold upper O Subscript bold 3 Baseline colonO3 : Given three arbitrary points on a line, at most one of them is between 
the other two. 
Notice that the axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 2O2 does not guarantee the existence of a point upper BB between 
two given onesupper AA andupper CC. This will be proven below. Nevertheless, if we assume that 
there exists upper BB between upper AA and upper CC, then the axiom bold upper O Subscript 3O3 guarantees that upper AA cannot be 
between upper BB and upper CC, and upper CC cannot be between upper AA and upper BB. Another theorem will clarify 
the situation of three given points on a line. 
Axiombold upper O Subscript bold 4O4 (Pasch): Let upper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C be three non-collinear points, andlla line situated 
in the plane left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesis(ABC) which does not pass through any of the points upper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C. If the 
line ll contains a point which is between upper AA and upper BB, then the line ll contains either a 
point between upper AA and upper CC or a point between upper BB and upper CC.
1.1 Absolute Geometry

We denote by ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC when upper BB is on the line upper A upper CAC and upper BB is between upper AA and upper CC, and 
we will refer to it as the order upper A upper B upper CABC. Note that by axiom bold upper O Subscript 1O1, the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC is the 
same as the order ModifyingAbove upper C upper B upper A With quotation dashC B A. 
An immediate consequence of the axioms of order is the following 
Theorem 1.1.5 Given two points upper AA and upper BB on a line ll, there is a point upper M element of lM ∈l such 
that we have the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper M upper B With quotation dashAM B. 
Proof There exists a pointupper CC not on the lineupper A upper BAB (axiombold upper I Subscript bold 2I2). Then there exists a point 
upper DD such that we have the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper C upper D With quotation dashAC D (axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 2O2). 
Similarly, there exists the point upper EE with respect to the order ModifyingAbove upper D upper B upper E With quotation dashDBE (axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 2O2). 
Then we apply axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 4O4 for the points upper C comma upper D comma upper EC, D, E and the line upper A upper BAB, so there exists a 
point upper MM on the line upper A upper BAB such that we have order ModifyingAbove upper A upper M upper B With quotation dashAM B.
▢
The previous theorem suggests the following. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.6 The set of points upper MM on the line upper A upper BAB with the property that upper MM is 
between upper AA and upper BB is called a segment, and it is denoted by left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB]. 
Formally we can write 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket equals StartSet upper M element of upper A upper B vertical bar ModifyingAbove upper A upper M upper B With quotation dash EndSet union StartSet upper A comma upper B EndSet period[AB] = {M ∈AB | AM B} ∪{A, B}.
The interior of the segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] is deﬁned to be the set left bracket upper A upper B right bracket minus StartSet upper A comma upper B EndSet[AB] −{A, B}. 
Note that the segmentleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], seen as a set of points, is equal to the segmentleft bracket upper B upper A right bracket[B A]. 
Moreover, the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper M upper B With quotation dashAM B is equivalent to upper M element of left bracket upper A upper B right bracket minus StartSet upper A comma upper B EndSetM ∈[AB] −{A, B}, so the previous 
theorem can be reformulated as follows: the interior of every segment is non-empty. 
We have also left bracket upper A upper A right bracket equals StartSet upper A EndSet[AA] = {A}. Moreover, we can deﬁne now one of the most important 
object of any geometry: the triangle. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.7 A conﬁguration of three distinct non-collinear points upper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C is 
called a triangle, and it is denoted by Delta upper A upper B upper CΔABC. Moreover, the points upper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C are 
called the vertexes of the triangle, and the segments determined by each pair of two 
vertexes are called the sides of the triangle. 
The next theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of ordering for three 
collinear points. 
Theorem 1.1.8 Let upper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C be three points on a line ll. Then one and only one of 
the orders ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dash comma ModifyingAbove upper A upper C upper B With quotation dashABC, AC B, or ModifyingAbove upper B upper A upper C With quotation dashB AC occurs.

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: How They Appear
Proof We assume that we have neither the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper C upper B With quotation dashAC B, nor the order ModifyingAbove upper B upper A upper C With quotation dashB AC, and we 
prove that we must have the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC. In our Euclidean intuition, we will prove 
that ifupper BB is not “to the left” ofupper AA and not “to the right” ofupper CC, then it must be between 
upper AA and upper CC. 
There exists a point upper D not an element of upper A upper CD /∈AC (axiom bold upper I Subscript bold 2I2). Then there exists a point upper E element of upper D upper BE ∈DB with 
the orderModifyingAbove upper E upper D upper B With quotation dashE DB (axiombold upper O Subscript bold 2O2). Looking at the triangleDelta upper B upper E upper CΔBEC and the secant lineupper A upper DAD, 
then there is a pointupper FF at the intersection ofupper A upper DAD andupper E upper CEC, such that we have the order 
ModifyingAbove upper E upper F upper C With quotation dashE FC (axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 4O4). In the same way, there exists the point StartSet upper G EndSet equals upper C upper D intersection upper A upper E{G} = C D ∩AE, such 
that we have the orderModifyingAbove upper A upper G upper E With quotation dashAGE. The lineupper C upper GCG is a secant line for the triangleDelta upper A upper E upper FΔAE F, as  
we have the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper D upper F With quotation dashADF. Moreover, considering the triangle Delta upper A upper F upper CΔAFC and the secant 
line upper D upper EDE, it follows the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC.

The following theorems establish incidence relations between a line and a triangle. 
Historically they are attributed to Moritz Pasch, whose inﬂuential works have been 
one century ago in the centre of attention of many authors interested in foundations 
of geometry. 
Theorem 1.1.9 If a line ll does not intersect two sides of a triangle Delta upper A upper B upper CΔABC, then it 
cannot intersect the third one, either. 
Proof Without loss of generality, we can assumell does not intersect neitherleft bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AC] nor 
left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC]. By contradiction, we assume ll intersects left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], so ll contains a point between 
upper AA and upper BB. Then the axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 4O4 afﬁrms that ll must contain either a point between upper AA
and upper CC, or a point between upper BB and upper CC, in contradiction with the hypothesis.
▢
Theorem 1.1.10 If a line ll intersects two sides of a triangle Delta upper A upper B upper CΔABC, then it cannot 
intersect the third one. 
Proof Let us assume, by contradiction, that the linell intersects all sidesleft bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC],left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AC], 
and left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] of the triangle Delta upper A upper B upper CΔABC in, respectively, upper DD, upper EE, and upper FF. We can assume the 
order ModifyingAbove upper E upper F upper D With quotation dashE FD on the line ll. We consider the triangle Delta upper C upper D upper EΔC DE and the secant line upper A upper BAB, 
which intersects left bracket upper D upper E right bracket[DE] in upper FF. It follows that upper A upper BAB intersects either left bracket upper D upper C right bracket[DC] or left bracket upper E upper C right bracket[EC]
(axiombold upper O Subscript bold 4O4). In both cases, it follows thatupper A upper BAB intersects eitherleft bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AC] orleft bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC], respec-
tively, in two points, which means that eitherupper A upper B equals upper B upper CAB = BC orupper A upper B equals upper A upper CAB = AC (axiombold upper I Subscript bold 1I1, in  
contradiction with the assumption that Delta upper A upper B upper CΔABC is a triangle.
▢
In what follows, we introduce the notion of half-line. Let  upper OO be a ﬁxed point on 
a line ll and let upper A comma upper B element of lA, B ∈l be two points such that we have the order ModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper B With quotation dashO AB. Then we 
callupper AA andupper BB to be on the same side of the pointupper OO. This deﬁnes a binary relation on 
the set of points of ll. 
Theorem 1.1.11 The binary relation deﬁned above is an equivalence relation on 
the set of points of a line ll.
1.1 Absolute Geometry
7
Proof Reﬂexivity is obviously true, as for upper A equals upper BA = B, we have clearly the order ModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper A With quotation dashO AA. 
The symmetry follows from the fact that the order ModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper B With quotation dashO AB is the same as the order 
ModifyingAbove upper B upper A upper O With quotation dashB AO (axiombold upper O Subscript bold 1O1). For the transitivity, we observe: if we haveModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper B With quotation dashO AB andModifyingAbove upper O upper B upper C With quotation dashO BC, then 
it follows the order ModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper C With quotation dashO AC.
▢
In this context, we can deﬁne a half-line as follows. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.12 The equivalence class of a point on a linell with respect to a ﬁxed 
point upper O element of lO ∈l is called the half-line with vertex (origin) upper OO. 
An equivalent formulation would be as follows: given a pair of points upper AA and upper BB, 
the half-line starting at upper AA and pointing in the direction of upper BB consists of all points upper PP
so that we have either the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper P With quotation dashAB P, or the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper P upper B With quotation dashAP B. A half-line upper A upper BAB is often 
called a ray emanated from upper AA towards upper BB. 
Theorem 1.1.13 Letupper OO andupper AA be two points on a linell. The set of pointsupper A prime element of lA, ∈l such 
that we have the order ModifyingAbove upper A prime upper O upper A With quotation dashA,O A forms a half-line with origin upper OO. 
Proof Letupper A primeA, be an arbitrary point such thatModifyingAbove upper A prime upper O upper A With quotation dashA,O A. Letupper BB be a representative of the 
equivalence class deﬁned by upper AA with respect to upper OO, i.e. upper AA and upper BB are on the same side 
of upper OO. Thus we have the order ModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper B With quotation dashO AB. Let upper B prime element of lB, ∈l such that we have the order ModifyingAbove upper B prime upper O upper B With quotation dashB,O B. 
From the orders ModifyingAbove upper B upper A upper O With quotation dashB AO and ModifyingAbove upper B prime upper O upper B With quotation dashB,O B it follows the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper O upper B prime With quotation dashAO B,. But the orders ModifyingAbove upper A prime upper O upper A With quotation dashA,O A
andModifyingAbove upper B prime upper O upper A With quotation dashB,O A exclude the orderModifyingAbove upper A prime upper O upper B prime With quotation dashA,O B, (try to prove this assertion). Therefore the points 
upper A primeA, and upper B primeB, are on the same side of upper OO, which proves the conclusion of the theorem.▢
The theorem above afﬁrms that a point upper OO on a line ll divides the line into two 
half-lines. For any point upper A not equals upper OA /= O, we denote one half-line by left parenthesis upper O upper A right parenthesis(O A), and the other 
half-line by left parenthesis upper O upper A prime(O A,, also called the complementary half-line of left parenthesis upper O upper A right parenthesis(O A). 
The set of points of a half-line is a total ordered set. Indeed, for two pointsupper AA and 
upper BB on a half-line, we have either upper AA coincides with upper BB, or we have one of the orders 
ModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper B With quotation dashO AB orModifyingAbove upper O upper B upper A With quotation dashO B A. If we have the orderModifyingAbove upper O upper A upper B With quotation dashO AB, we sayupper AA precedesupper BB. Therefore, in view 
of this total ordering, for any two distinct points upper AA and upper BB on a half-line, either upper AA
precedes upper BB or upper BB precedes upper AA. 
In view of this remark, we can arrange any ﬁnite set of points on a line ll in the 
order of their precedence. Moreover, if we denote the ordered points byupper A 1 comma upper A 2 comma ellipsisA1, A2, . . . , 
then for any i less than j less than ki < j < k we have the order ModifyingAbove upper A Subscript i Baseline upper A Subscript j Baseline upper A Subscript k With quotation dashAi A j Ak. This proves the following: 
Theorem 1.1.14 There is an order-preserving, one-to-one correspondence between 
any set of nn points on a line ll and the set of natural numbers StartSet 1 comma 2 comma ellipsis comma n EndSet{1, 2, . . . , n}. 
Similarly as in the case of half-lines, one can introduce the following binary 
relation of the set of points in a plane. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.15 If ll is a line in a plane piπ and upper A comma upper BA, B are two points in piπ such that 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket intersection l equals normal empty set[AB] ∩l = ∅, then we say that the pointsupper AA andupper BB are on the same side of the plane 
piπ with respect to the line ll.
8

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: How They Appear
This deﬁnes a binary relation on the set of points of the plane piπ. 
As before, we prove the following: 
Theorem 1.1.16 The binary relation deﬁned above is an equivalence relation. 
Proof Reﬂexivity and symmetry are obviously true. We have to prove the transitivity 
of this relation. Let upper A comma upper BA, B and upper B comma upper CB, C be on the same side of the plane piπ with respect 
to the line ll. If follows that the intersections of ll with left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], respectively left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC], are  
empty. From a previous theorem it follows thatl intersection left bracket upper A upper C right bracket equals normal empty setl ∩[AC] = ∅, so the pointsupper A comma upper CA, C are 
on the same side of the plane with respect to the line ll.
▢
In view of the theorem above, we give the following: 
Deﬁnition 1.1.17 Let ll be a ﬁxed line in a plane piπ and a point upper A element of pi minus lA ∈π −l. The  
equivalence class of upper AA with respect to the line ll is deﬁned to be the half-plane 
determined by upper AA and ll. The line ll is called the border of this half-plane. 
Then we have the following. 
Letll be a ﬁxed line, and letupper A not an element of lA /∈l. Then the set of pointsupper A primeA, with the property that 
the segment left bracket upper A upper A prime right bracket[AA,] intersects the line ll forms a half-plane of border ll. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.18 This half-plane is called the complementary half-plane of the half-
plane determined by ll and upper AA. 
Note that every line ll in a plane divides the plane into two half-planes, both with 
border ll. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.19 An angle is deﬁned to be a pair of two half-lineshh andkk with the 
same originupper OO, denoted byangle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk). The pointupper OO is called the vertex of the angle, and 
the half-lines hh and kk are called the sides of the angle. 
Ifh equals left parenthesis upper O upper Ah = (O A andk equals left parenthesis upper O upper Bk = (O B are two half-lines deﬁned by three non-collinear points 
upper O comma upper AO, A, andupper BB (upper OO is the vertex of the angle), then we will also denote the angleangle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk)
by angle upper A upper O upper B∠AO B. 
Let us consider an angle angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) in a plane  piπ. Then, there are two distinguished 
half-planes: one is determined by the underlying line of the half-linehh and the points 
of the half-line kk, and, similarly, the other one is determined by the underlying line 
of the half-line kk and the points of the half-line hh. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.20 We call the interior of the angle angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk), the intersection of the 
two half-planes above. The exterior of the angle angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) consists of all the points in 
the plane which are neither in the interior, nor on the sides of the angle angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk). 
In a similar fashion, one can deﬁne the interior of a triangle as follows.
1.1 Absolute Geometry

Fig. 1.1 Crossbar theorem 
Deﬁnition 1.1.21 The interior of the triangle Delta upper A upper B upper CΔABCis the intersection of the inte-
riors of its angles. 
Consider nn half-lines with common vertex upper OO and assume that there exists a line 
l does not contain as member upper Ol /∋O which intersects all of them. We can order all the intersection points (ModifyingAbove upper A 1 upper A 2 upper A 3 With quotation dashA1A2 A3, 
etc.). This gives us the notion of a half-line being between two other half-lines, and 
implicitly an order on the set of half-lines. 
The following theorem is usually known as the crossbar theorem, or, sometimes, 
as the transversal theorem . In the present approach, the proof relies on axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 4O4, 
Pasch’s axiom (Fig. 1.1). 
Theorem 1.1.22 (Crossbar Theorem) Letangle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) be an angle of vertexupper OO. Letupper A element of hA ∈h
and upper B element of kB ∈k be two points different than upper OO, and upper TT a point in the interior of the angle 
angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk). Then the half-line left parenthesis upper O upper T(OT intersects the segments left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB]. 
Proof Denote byupper H Subscript upper AHA the half-plane determined byupper O upper BO B and the pointupper AA. Consider a 
pointupper A primeA, on the complementary half-line ofleft parenthesis upper O upper A(O A, andupper H Subscript upper A primeHA, the half-plane determined 
by upper O upper BO B and the point upper A primeA,. We apply Pasch’s axiom bold upper O Subscript bold 4O4 for the triangle Delta upper A upper A prime upper BΔAA,B and 
the half-line left parenthesis upper O upper T(OT , which intersects left bracket upper A upper A prime right bracket[AA,] in upper OO. Then left parenthesis upper O upper T(OT should intersect either 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] or left bracket upper A prime upper B right bracket[A,B]. If  left parenthesis upper O upper T(OT doesn’t intersect left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], it exists a point upper L element of left bracket upper A prime upper B right bracket intersection left parenthesis upper O upper TL ∈[A,B] ∩(OT , 
in collision with the fact that all points of left parenthesis upper O upper T(OT are in upper H Subscript upper A primeHA,.
▢
As a ﬁnal remark, we can observe that the complementary half-line of left parenthesis upper O upper T(OT , say  
left parenthesis upper O upper T prime(OT , is included in the interior of the opposite angle ofangle upper A upper O upper B∠AO B, sayangle upper A prime upper O upper B prime∠A,O B,, there-
fore it cannot intersect neitherleft bracket upper A prime upper B right bracket[A,B] norleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], because they have empty intersection 
with the interior of angle upper A prime upper O upper B prime∠A,O B,. 
Angles as angle upper A upper O upper T∠AOT and angle upper T upper O upper B∠T O B are called adjacent angles.

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: How They Appear
We introduce below the axioms of congruence and we study their immediate 
consequences. The congruence notion we introduce below is actually an equality 
notion, but it is called different just to make distinction between equality of real 
numbers and equality of geometric objects. The relationship between the set of real 
numbers and geometry is addressed later on. 
The formulation of these axioms is after Arthur Rosenthal [185], which has con-
siderably modiﬁed the original Hilbert’s formulation of Axiom bold upper E bold 4E4, by omitting the 
symmetry and transitivity properties of the congruence of angles. These properties 
can be actually proven from the axioms below. 
The following axioms introduce the concept of congruence (equality) of segments 
and angles. The notion of congruence is written using the special symbolidentical to≡, in order 
to eliminate any confusion between this geometric notion with the equality notion 
from set or number theories. We will reserve the equality symbol equals= for when we 
deﬁne the values of segments and angles. 
Axiom upper E bold 1 colonE1 : If upper AA and upper BB are two points on a line ll, and upper A primeA, is a point on a line l primel,, 
wherel primel, is not necessarily distinct from ll, then there exists a point upper B primeB, on l primel, such that 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,]. For every segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper B upper A right bracket[AB] ≡[B A]. 
As we can see from the previous axiom, the congruence left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,] is pro-
vided by the ability to construct the pointupper B primeB, on the linel primel, with the requested property. 
Axiom upper E Subscript bold 2 colonE2: If left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[A,B,] ≡[AB] and left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[A,,B,,] ≡[AB], then left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket[A,B,] ≡[A,,B,,]. 
Note that this axiom is not the transitivity property of congruence of segments. 
Transitivity will be proved in a theorem below. The next axiom establishes the addi-
tivity of the congruence of segments. 
Axiom upper E Subscript bold 3 colonE3: Let left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] and left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC] be two segments of a line ll, without common 
interior points, and let left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,B,] and left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[B,C,] be two segments without common interior 
points on a line l primel,, where l primel, is not necessarily distinct from ll. If left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,] and 
left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,], then left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[AC] ≡[A,C,]. 
The next axiom deﬁnes the congruence of angles in a plane. 
Axiom upper E Subscript bold 4 colonE4: Let angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) be an angle in a plane piπ, and let l primel, be a line in a plane 
pi primeπ,, where pi primeπ, is not necessarily distinct from piπ. Let h primeh, be a half-line of l primel,, where 
h primeh, is not necessarily distinct from hh. Then in one of the half-planes determined by 
l primel,, there uniquely exists a half-line k primek,, such that angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(hk) ≡∠(h,k,). For every angle, 
angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) ≡∠(hk) (reﬂexivity), and angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis k h right parenthesis∠(hk) ≡∠(kh) (symmetry). 
As above, the congruenceangle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(hk) ≡∠(h,k,) is provided by the ability to construct 
the angle angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,) in one of the half-planes of pi primeπ,. 
Axiom upper E Subscript bold 5 colonE5: For any angles, if 
angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(h,k,) ≡∠(hk) and angle left parenthesis h double prime k double prime right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(h,,k,,) ≡∠(hk), then 
angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h double prime k double prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,) ≡∠(h,,k,,). 
The next axiom is establishing conditions for congruences of angles of triangles. 
For an angle of a triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC, say angle upper A upper B upper C∠ABC, we understand the angle determined 
by the half-lines left parenthesis upper B upper A(B A and left parenthesis upper B upper C(BC.

[A,C,], and angle upper B upper A upper C identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper C prime∠B AC ≡∠B,A,C,, then:

∠AC B ≡∠A,C,B,.
The ﬁrst two congruence axioms give the following result. 
Theorem 1.1.23 The congruence relation for segments is an equivalence relation. 
Proof We prove ﬁrst the following statement: if we have two segments left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡
[A,B,], thenleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper A prime right bracket[AB] ≡[B,A,]. Indeed, we haveleft bracket upper B prime upper A prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[B, A,] ≡[A,B,](axiombold upper E Subscript bold 1E1). Therefore 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,] andleft bracket upper B prime upper A prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[B,A,] ≡[A,B,], so, using axiombold upper E Subscript bold 2E2, it followsleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper A prime right bracket[AB] ≡[B,A,]. 
Reﬂexivity now follows from axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 1E1 (left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper B upper A right bracket[AB] ≡[B A]) and, from the statement 
above, it follows left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] ≡[AB]. 
How to prove the symmetry? We haveleft bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,B,] ≡[A,B,], via the reﬂexivity proved 
above. Moreover, ifleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,] it follows thatleft bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[A,B,] ≡[AB], via Axiombold upper E Subscript bold 2E2. It  
is very important to notice that only from this point on, we have the right to assert 
that left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper C upper D right bracket[AB] ≡[C D] is the same as left bracket upper C upper D right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[C D] ≡[AB]. 
For transitivity, we consider left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,], and left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket[A,B,] ≡[A,,B,,]. But  the  
congruence left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket[A,B,] ≡[A,,B,,] implies the congruence left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,,B,,] ≡[A,B,] (symme-
try). Then, from left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,] and left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,,B,,] ≡[A,B,], it follows the congruence 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A double prime upper B double prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,,B,,] (axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 2E2).
▢
The congruence relation, being an equivalence relation, gives rise to a partition of 
the set of all segments in disjoint equivalence classes. This fact allows us to deﬁne 
all segments in an equivalence class to have the same value. We denote the value of a 
segmentleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] by simplyupper A upper BAB. Note that the same notationupper A upper BAB is also used for the line 
which passed through the pointsupper AA andupper BB. In general it is clear from the context if we 
refer to the line upper A upper BAB or to the value of the segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB]. Moreover, the congruence 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper C upper D right bracket[AB] ≡[C D] can be also written as an equality of values, upper A upper B equals upper C upper DAB = C D, when there 
is no danger of confusion between equivalence classes and their representatives. In 
what follows, going back and forth between congruence of segments (or angles) 
and equality of their values, technically requires one to prove the independence of 
chosen representatives in a given equivalence class. For the simplicity of geometric 
arguments, we will omit these technical details. 
Theorem 1.1.24 Let left parenthesis upper O upper A(O A be a half-line with origin upper OO. If upper CC and upper C primeC, are two points 
on left parenthesis upper O upper A(O A such that left bracket upper O upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper O upper C prime right bracket[OC] ≡[OC,], then the points upper CC and upper C primeC, coincide. 
Proof Without loss of generality, we can assume the order ModifyingAbove upper O upper C upper C prime With quotation dashOCC,. Let upper II be a point 
which does not belong to the half-lineleft parenthesis upper O upper A(O A (Axiombold upper I Subscript bold 3I3). Then, in the trianglesDelta upper O upper C upper IΔOC I
and Delta upper O upper C prime upper IΔOC,I, we have  left bracket upper O upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper O upper C prime right bracket[OC] ≡[OC,], left bracket upper O upper I right bracket identical to left bracket upper O upper I right bracket[OI] ≡[OI] and angle upper I upper O upper C identical to angle upper I upper O upper C prime∠I OC ≡∠I OC,.

Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 6E6 it follows angle upper O upper I upper C identical to angle upper O upper I upper C prime∠OIC ≡∠OIC,, therefore the half-lines left parenthesis upper I upper C(IC and left parenthesis upper I upper C prime(IC, coin-
cide as sets (Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 4E4). This implies left parenthesis upper I upper C intersection left parenthesis upper O upper A equals left parenthesis upper I upper C Superscript prime Baseline intersection left parenthesis upper O upper A(IC ∩(O A = (IC, ∩(O A, so  upper CC and upper C primeC,
coincide.
▢
Sometimes we write upper C equals upper C primeC = C, whenever upper CC and upper C primeC, coincide. Notice that the equal 
sign which expresses the coincidence is not the same as the usual symbolequals= of equal-
ity of numbers. 
Note that Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 3E3 guarantees the additivity of the values of segments on same 
line. Indeed, ifupper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C andupper A prime comma upper B prime comma upper C primeA,, B,, C, are points on the linesll andl primel,, respectively, with 
orders ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC and ModifyingAbove upper A prime upper B prime upper C prime With quotation dashA,B,C,, respectively, such that left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,], left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,], 
then it follows directly from Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 3E3 that left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[AC] ≡[A,C,]. We can formally write 
the following equalities in terms of values of segments:upper A upper C equals upper A upper B plus upper B upper CAC = AB + BC andupper A prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline equals upper A prime upper B Superscript prime Baseline plus upper B prime upper C primeA,C, =
A,B, + B,C,. 
Theorem 1.1.25 The congruence relation for segments preserves the order relation. 
Proof Consider the pointsupper A comma upper B comma upper CA, B, C on a linell, with the property thatupper BB is an interior 
point of the segment left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AC], i.e. we have the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC. Moreover, let us consider 
the points upper A prime comma upper B prime comma upper C primeA,, B,, C, on another line l primel,, such that left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,], left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[AC] ≡[A,C,], 
and upper B prime comma upper C primeB,, C, are on the same half-line of vertex upper A primeA,. 
If we show thatupper B primeB, is interior toleft bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[A,C,], andleft bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[B,C,] ≡[BC], then it will follow the 
orderModifyingAbove upper A prime upper B prime upper C prime With quotation dashA,B,C,, which is the conclusion of our theorem. Indeed, assume the existence 
of another point upper C double prime element of l primeC,, ∈l, with order ModifyingAbove upper A prime upper B prime upper C double prime With quotation dashA,B,C,,, such that left bracket upper B prime upper C double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[B,C,,] ≡[BC]. left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[A,B,] ≡
[AB] andleft bracket upper B prime upper C double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[B,C,,] ≡[BC], so, by additivity, it followsleft bracket upper A prime upper C double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[A,C,,] ≡[AC]. Butleft bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[A,C,] ≡
[AC], thus left bracket upper A prime upper C double prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[A,C,,] ≡[A,C,], therefore it follows that upper C prime equals upper C double primeC, = C,,. Thus we have the 
desired order ModifyingAbove upper A prime upper B prime upper C prime With quotation dashA,B,C,.
▢
In view of the results above, one can deﬁne the difference operation among seg-
ments. Indeed, if left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] and left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AC] are two segments on a line ll, such that they have 
order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC, then the difference of the values of left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AC] and left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] is the value of the 
segment left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC], respecting the additivity property upper A upper B plus upper B upper C equals upper A upper CAB + BC = AC. Therefore we 
can write upper A upper C minus upper A upper B equals upper B upper CAC −AB = BC. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.26 Two triangleswhite up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC andwhite up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔA,B,C, are called congruent, and we 
denote by white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔABC ≡ΔA,B,C,, if they have congruent sides and congruent angles, 
respectively. 
Concretely, white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔABC ≡ΔA,B,C, if the following six congruences are respected: 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B Superscript prime Baseline right bracket comma left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline right bracket comma left bracket upper C upper A right bracket identical to left bracket upper C prime upper A Superscript prime Baseline right bracket comma[AB] ≡[A,B,],
[BC] ≡[B,C,],
[C A] ≡[C,A,],
angle upper B upper A upper C identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline comma angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper A prime upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline comma angle upper B upper C upper A identical to angle upper B prime upper C prime upper A Superscript prime Baseline period∠B AC ≡∠B, A,C,,
∠ABC ≡∠A,B,C,,
∠BC A ≡∠B,C,A,.
When there is no danger of confusion, we denote byangle upper A∠A the angleangle upper B upper A upper C∠B AC. The ﬁrst

Theorem 1.1.27 If a trianglewhite up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC has two congruent sides, then it has two con-
gruent angles, too. In this case, we call the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC to be isosceles. 
Proof Without loss of generality, we can assume left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AB] ≡[AC]. Then the triangles 
white up pointing triangle upper B upper A upper CΔB AC and white up pointing triangle upper C upper A upper BΔC AB are in the conditions of Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 6E6, thus angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper A upper C upper B∠ABC ≡∠AC B.

The next theorem is the ﬁrst important congruence case of triangles (Fig. 1.2). 
Theorem 1.1.28 (SAS) Let white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC and white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔA,B,C, be two triangles, such that 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,],left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[AC] ≡[A,C,], andangle upper B upper A upper C identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper C prime∠B AC ≡∠B,A,C,. Thenwhite up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔABC ≡ΔA,B,C,. 
(This congruence case is called Side-Angle-Side (SAS).) 
Proof Using axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 6E6, we have angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper A prime upper B prime upper C prime∠ABC ≡∠A,B,C, and angle upper A upper C upper B identical to angle upper A prime upper C prime upper B prime∠AC B ≡∠A,C,B,. The  
only congruence left to show isleft bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,]. Consider a pointupper C double primeC,, on the half-line 
left parenthesis upper B prime upper C prime(B,C, such that left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C double prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,,] (Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 1E1). Consider now the triangles white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC
and white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C double primeΔA,B,C,,. From  left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,], left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C double prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,,], and angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper A upper B prime upper C double prime∠ABC ≡∠AB,C,,, it  
follows from axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 6E6 that angle upper B upper A upper C identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper C double prime∠B AC ≡∠B, A,C,,. From the hypothesis, we have 
angle upper B upper A upper C identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper C prime∠B AC ≡∠B,A,C,. Then we have upper C primeC, and upper C double primeC,, such that the angles angle upper C prime upper A prime upper B prime∠C,A,B, and 
angle upper C double prime upper A prime upper B prime∠C,,A,B, are congruent. Since upper C primeC, and upper C double primeC,, are in the same half-plane with respect 
to the line upper A prime upper B primeA,B,, it follows from axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 4E4 that left parenthesis upper A prime upper C prime(A,C, and left parenthesis upper A prime upper C double prime(A,C,, coincide, thus 
upper C prime equals upper C double primeC, = C,,.
▢
The next theorem establishes the second case of triangle congruence (Fig. 1.3). 
Theorem 1.1.29 (ASA) Let white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC and white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔA,B,C, be two triangles, such that 
left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,], 
angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper A prime upper B prime upper C prime∠ABC ≡∠A,B,C,, and 
angle upper A upper C upper B identical to angle upper A prime upper C prime upper B prime∠AC B ≡∠A,C,B,. Then 
white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔABC
≡ΔA,B,C,. (This congruence case is called Angle-Side-Angle (ASA).) 
Proof Letupper A Superscript double prime Baseline element of left parenthesis upper B prime upper A primeA,, ∈(B,A, such thatleft bracket upper B upper A right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper A double prime right bracket[B A] ≡[B,A,,]. Consider the triangleswhite up pointing triangle upper B upper A upper CΔB AC and 
white up pointing triangle upper B prime upper A double prime upper C primeΔB,A,,C,. Axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 6E6 guarantees that angle upper B upper C upper A identical to angle upper B prime upper C prime upper A double prime∠BC A ≡∠B,C,A,,. Since upper A primeA, and upper A double primeA,, are in 
the same half-plane with respect to upper B prime upper C primeB,C,, it follows that left parenthesis upper C prime upper A prime(C,A, and left parenthesis upper C prime upper A double prime(C,A,, coincide. 
Therefore,upper A prime equals upper A double primeA, = A,,. We apply Theorem SAS for the triangleswhite up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC andwhite up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔA,B,C,, 
where we now have left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B,], left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,] and angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper A prime upper B prime upper C prime∠ABC ≡∠A,B,C,.

Theorem 1.1.30 (Additivity of Angles) If angle left parenthesis h l right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h prime l prime right parenthesis∠(hl) ≡∠(h,l,), and angle left parenthesis l k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis l prime k prime right parenthesis∠(lk) ≡∠(l,k,),

Proof Let upper HH and upper KK be two points such that upper H element of hH ∈h and upper K element of kK ∈k. Using Crossbar

But the segments left bracket upper H upper L right bracket comma left bracket upper L upper K right bracket semicolon left bracket upper H prime upper L Superscript prime Baseline right bracket comma left bracket upper L prime upper K prime right bracket[H L], [LK]; [H ,L,], [L,K ,] satisfy the conditions of axiom bold upper E Subscript bold 3E3, 
thus the triangles white up pointing triangle upper O upper H upper KΔO H K and white up pointing triangle upper O prime upper H prime upper K primeΔO,H ,K , are congruent (case SAS). It follows that 
angle upper H upper O upper K identical to angle upper H prime upper O prime upper K prime∠H OK ≡∠H ,O,K ,, thus using axiombold upper E Subscript bold 4E4, it follows that the half-linesleft parenthesis upper O prime upper K prime(O,K , and

Suppose we are in the same hypothesis as in Theorem of Additivity of Angles. 
Theorem 1.1.31 If angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(hk) ≡∠(h,k,), and angle left parenthesis h l right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h prime l prime right parenthesis∠(hl) ≡∠(h,l,), then angle left parenthesis l k right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis l prime k prime right parenthesis∠(lk) ≡∠(l,k,). 
Proof Consider the triangleswhite up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC andwhite up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B upper CΔA,BC such thatupper AA andupper A primeA, are in different

If  left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B right bracket[AB] ≡[A,B] and left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C right bracket[AC] ≡[A,C], then 
triangles white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC and white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B upper CΔA,BC have congruent angles, respectively. Considering the 
segmentsleft bracket upper A upper A prime right bracket[AA,] andleft bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC], we distinguish two cases:left bracket upper A upper A prime right bracket intersection left bracket upper B upper C right bracket not equals normal empty set[AA,] ∩[BC] /= ∅orleft bracket upper A upper A prime right bracket intersection left bracket upper B upper C right bracket equals normal empty set[AA,] ∩
[BC] = ∅. In each one of these cases, we apply the theorem for isosceles triangles 
in the case of triangles white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper A primeΔAB A, and white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper A primeΔAB A,, respectively. The conclusion of the 
theorem follows then immediately.

Now we are in the right context to prove the following side-side-side (SSS) con-
gruence theorem of triangles. Note that in the proof we do not use neither the sym-
metry, nor the transitivity of the equality relation for angles! These properties are an 
immediate corollary to the following theorem (Fig. 1.4). 
Theorem 1.1.32 (SSS) Letwhite up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC andwhite up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔA,B,C, be two triangles, such thatleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≡
[A,B,], left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,], and left bracket upper C upper A right bracket identical to left bracket upper C prime upper A prime right bracket[C A] ≡[C,A,]. Then white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔABC ≡ΔA,B,C,. This con-
gruence case is called Side-Side-Side (SSS).

Fig. 1.4 Theorem SSS 
Proof Consider the half-line left parenthesis upper B prime upper D prime(B,D, such that left bracket upper B prime upper D prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[B,D,] ≡[AB] and angle upper D prime upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper A upper B upper C∠D,B,C, ≡
∠ABC, upper D primeD, in the half-plane determined by upper A primeA, and upper B prime upper C primeB,C,. 
Since 
left bracket upper B upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper C prime right bracket[BC] ≡[B,C,], 
left bracket upper B upper A right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper D prime right bracket[B A] ≡[B,D,], and 
angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper D prime upper B prime upper C prime∠ABC ≡∠D,B,C,, 
white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper D prime upper B prime upper C primeΔABC ≡
ΔD,B,C, (case SAS). It follows that left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper D prime upper C prime right bracket[AC] ≡[D,C,]. Let us construct a point upper E primeE,
in the complementary half-plane deﬁned by the lineupper B prime upper C primeB,C, and the pointupper A primeA,, such that 
left bracket upper B prime upper E prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper D prime right bracket[B,E,] ≡[B,D,] and angle upper E prime upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper C prime upper B prime upper D prime∠E,B,C, ≡∠C,B,D,. It follows that white up pointing triangle upper D prime upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to white up pointing triangle upper E prime upper B prime upper C primeΔD,B,C, ≡ΔE,B,C,
(case SAS), thusleft bracket upper E prime upper C prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper D prime upper C prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper C prime right bracket[E,C,] ≡[D,C,] ≡[AC] ≡[A,C,]. Similarly,left bracket upper E prime upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper B prime upper D prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[E,B,] ≡[B,D,] ≡
[AB] ≡[A,B,]. 
Then, using the fact that isosceles triangles have equal angles corresponding to 
equal sides, the trianglesDelta upper A prime upper B prime upper C primeΔA,B,C, andDelta upper E prime upper B prime upper C primeΔE,B,C, are congruent (since we use the pre-
vious theorems with sum or difference of angles to prove thatangle upper B prime upper A prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper B prime upper E prime upper C prime∠B,A,C, ≡∠B,E,C,). 
Thenangle upper A prime upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper E prime upper B prime upper C prime∠A,B,C, ≡∠E,B,C,, so in the half-plane determined byupper B prime upper C primeB,C, andupper A primeA, we have 
two half-lines left parenthesis upper B prime upper D prime(B,D, and left parenthesis upper B prime upper A prime(B,A,, such that they determine angle upper A prime upper B prime upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper D prime upper B prime upper C prime∠A,B,C, ≡∠D,B,C,. 
Therefore they are coincident and this means that the points upper A primeA, and upper D primeD, have to 
coincide.

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: How They Appear
Fig. 1.5 Right angle 
existence 
Deﬁnition 1.1.35 Let angle h k∠hk be an angle. The angle formed by a ray of angle angle h k∠hk
and the complement of the other ray is called the supplementary angle to the angle 
angle h k∠hk. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.36 Two angles which have the same vertex and complementary sides 
are called opposite (or complementary) angles. 
We propose two problems to the reader. 
Problema 1.1.37 Supplementary angles of congruent angles are congruent. 
Problema 1.1.38 Opposite angles are congruent. 
Hint for both problems: choose points on rays such that congruent triangles occur 
(Fig. 1.5). 
Deﬁnition 1.1.39 A right angle is an angle congruent to its supplementary angle. 
We denote by upper RR the class of the right angles. 
The following theorem establishes the existence of right angles in any geometry 
respecting all axioms introduced so far. 
Theorem 1.1.40 There exist right angles. 
Proof Consider the congruent anglesangle h l∠hl andangle l k∠lk such that all rays have the common 
pointupper OO andll belongs to the interior ofangle h k∠hk. Chooseupper A element of h comma upper B element of kA ∈h, B ∈k such thatleft bracket upper O upper A right bracket identical to left bracket upper O upper B right bracket[O A] ≡
[O B]. Crossbar theorem tells us that it existsStartSet upper T EndSet equals l intersection left bracket upper A upper B right bracket{T } = l ∩[AB]. It is easy to see using 
congruent triangles that angle upper A upper T upper O identical to angle upper B upper T upper O∠AT O ≡∠BT O, i.e. angle upper A upper T upper O∠AT O and angle upper B upper T upper O∠BT O are both right 
angles.

The supplementary angle of an right angle is a right angle itself. The angleangle upper A upper T upper B∠AT B
can be seen as the sum of the right angles angle upper A upper T upper O∠AT O and angle upper O upper T upper B∠OT B, therefore its class is 
upper R plus upper RR + R, i.e. 2 upper R2R. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.41 The points upper AA and upper BB are called symmetric with respect the line ll. 
The line upper A upper TAT is called perpendicular to ll, upper TT is called the foot of the perpendicular 
line to ll passing through upper AA. 
Theorem 1.1.42 All right angles are congruent. 
Proof By contradiction, we assume that there exist two right angles angle upper B upper A upper D∠B AD and 
angle upper B prime upper A prime upper D prime∠B,A,D, which are not congruent. We consider the supplementary angles angle upper C upper A upper D∠C AD
andangle upper C prime upper A prime upper D prime∠C, A,D,, respectively. Consider the half-lineleft parenthesis upper A upper E(AE such thatangle upper B upper A upper E identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper D prime∠B AE ≡∠B,A,D,
and observe the equality of anglesangle upper C upper A upper E identical to upper C prime upper A prime upper D prime∠C AE ≡C,A,D,. Therefore we haveangle upper C upper A upper E identical to angle upper C prime upper A prime upper D Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper B prime upper A prime upper D Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper B upper A upper E∠C AE ≡
∠C,A,D, ≡∠B, A,D, ≡∠B AE. Let  left parenthesis upper A upper F(AF such that angle upper C upper A upper E identical to angle upper B upper A upper E∠C AE ≡∠B AE. It results 
angle upper C upper A upper E identical to angle upper C upper A upper F∠C AE ≡∠C AF, in collision with ESubscript bold 44.

Theorem 1.1.43 The perpendicular line from an exterior point to a given line is 
unique. 
Proof By contradiction, supposeupper A upper CAC andupper A upper C primeAC, are perpendicular lines toll,upper C comma upper C prime element of lC, C, ∈l. 
Consider the symmetric points upper B comma upper B primeB, B, of upper AA with respect to ll on each perpendicular 
line and choose upper O element of lO ∈l such that the order is ModifyingAbove upper O upper C prime upper C With quotation dashOC,C. It results white up pointing triangle upper O upper C upper A identical to white up pointing triangle upper O upper C upper BΔOC A ≡ΔOC B
and white up pointing triangle upper O upper C prime upper A identical to white up pointing triangle upper O upper C prime upper B primeΔOC,A ≡ΔOC,B,. We have  angle upper B upper O upper C identical to angle upper A upper O upper C Superscript prime Baseline identical to angle upper B prime upper O prime upper C prime∠BOC ≡∠AOC, ≡∠B,O,C, and left bracket upper O upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper O upper B prime right bracket identical to left bracket upper O upper A right bracket[O B] ≡
[O B,] ≡[O A], i.e. upper BB and upper B primeB, coincide, therefore upper CC coincides upper C primeC,.

Deﬁnition 1.1.44 Letleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] andleft bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,B,] be two segments. If there exists a pointupper CC in 
the interior of the segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] such that left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AC] ≡[A,B,], we say that the segment 
left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,B,] is less than the segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], and we denote by left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket less than left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[A,B,] < [AB]. 
In the same time we may say that the segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] is greater than the seg-
ment left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[A,B,] and we denote by left bracket upper A upper B right bracket greater than left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] > [A,B,]. Note that the order ModifyingAbove upper A upper B upper C With quotation dashABC on a line 
determines the inequalities left bracket upper A upper B right bracket less than left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[AB] < [AC] and left bracket upper B upper C right bracket greater than left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[BC] > [AC]. We may also deﬁne 
left bracket upper A upper B right bracket less than or equals left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] ≤[A,B,], etc. The inequality relation less than or equals≤is a partial order relation on the set 
of segment and more, if left bracket upper A upper B right bracket greater than left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket[AB] > [A,B,] and left bracket upper C upper D right bracket greater than left bracket upper C prime upper D prime right bracket[C D] > [C,D,], then left bracket upper A upper B right bracket plus left bracket upper C upper D right bracket greater than left bracket upper A prime upper B prime right bracket plus left bracket upper C prime upper D prime right bracket[AB] + [C D] >
[A,B,] + [C,D,]. The inequality can be transferred to values with the notations estab-
lished there. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.45 Let angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,) and angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) be two angles. If there is a line ll in the 
interior of the angle angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) such that angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis identical to angle left parenthesis h l right parenthesis∠(h,k,) ≡∠(hl), then we can say that the 
angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,) is less than the angle angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk), denoted by angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis less than or equals angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(h,k,) ≤∠(hk). 
Or, we can say that the angleangle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) is greater than the angleangle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,), denoted by 
angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis greater than angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(hk) > ∠(h,k,). We can easily deﬁne angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis greater than or equals angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(hk) ≥∠(h,k,) or angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis less than or equals angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(h,k,) ≤∠(hk). 
We do not insist and we left to the reader to prove that the inequality relations greater than or equals≥
and less than or equals≤are partial order relations on the set of angles.

Fig. 1.6 The exterior angle theorem 
Deﬁnition 1.1.47 Consider the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC. The angle formed by the half-line 
(upper B upper AB A and the complement half-line of (upper B upper CBC, say  (upper B upper DBD, is called the exterior angle of 
the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC with respect to the vertex upper BB. 
Consider the angle formed by the half-line left parenthesis upper B upper C(BC and the complement half-line 
of left parenthesis upper B upper A(B A, say  left parenthesis upper B upper F(BF. This angle is also the exterior angle of the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC with 
respect to the vertexupper BB, and of courseangle upper A upper B upper D identical to angle upper C upper B upper F∠ABD ≡∠C BF as opposite angles. Having 
in mind the previous deﬁnition we can prove (Fig. 1.6). 
Theorem 1.1.48 (Exterior Angle Theorem) The exterior angle of a triangle with 
respect to a given vertex is greater than both the angles of the triangle which are not 
adjacent to it. 
Proof Let us ﬁx the vertex to beupper BB. We have to prove “the exterior angle of the triangle 
white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC with respect the vertexupper BB is greater than both the anglesangle upper B upper A upper C∠B AC andangle upper A upper C upper B∠AC B”. 
Letupper DD be a point onupper B upper CBC with the orderModifyingAbove upper D upper B upper C With quotation dashDBC such thatleft bracket upper B upper D right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper C right bracket[BD] ≡[AC]. We show that 
angle upper D upper B upper A greater than angle upper B upper A upper C∠DB A > ∠B AC. The other inequality results from angle upper A upper B upper D identical to angle upper C upper B upper F greater than angle upper A upper C upper B∠ABD ≡∠C BF > ∠AC B. 
We focus on the ﬁrst inequality. By contradiction, let us suppose that angle upper A upper B upper D identical to angle upper B upper A upper C∠ABD ≡
∠B AC. If we succeed to obtain a contradiction, the caseangle upper A upper B upper D less than angle upper B upper A upper C∠ABD < ∠B AC is reduced 
to the previous case by consideringupper C 1 element of left parenthesis upper B upper C right parenthesisC1 ∈(BC) such thatangle upper A upper B upper D identical to angle upper B upper A upper C 1∠ABD ≡∠B AC1. There-
fore, it remains to prove that angle upper A upper B upper D identical to angle upper B upper A upper C∠ABD ≡∠B AC is impossible. In the given condi-
tions it results white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper D identical to white up pointing triangle upper C upper A upper B comma left parenthesis upper S upper A upper S right parenthesisΔABD ≡ΔC AB, (SAS), i.e. angle upper D upper A upper B identical to angle upper A upper B upper C∠DAB ≡∠ABC. Since angle upper C upper A upper D identical to angle upper C upper A upper B plus angle upper B upper A upper D identical to angle upper A upper B upper D plus angle upper A upper B upper C identical to angle upper C upper B upper D equals 2 upper R∠C AD ≡
∠C AB + ∠B AD ≡∠ABD + ∠ABC ≡∠C BD = 2R, equivalent toupper A element of upper B upper CA ∈BC, in  
collision to the fact that upper A upper B upper CABC is a triangle.

Corollary 1.1.49 The sum of two among the three angles of triangle is less than the 
sum of two right angles. 
Proof To simplify the writing denote by upper B Subscript eBe the exterior angle with respect to the 
vertex upper BB. The exterior angle theorem asserts that upper B Subscript e Baseline greater than upper A comma upper B Subscript e Baseline greater than upper CBe > A, Be > C. It results upper B Subscript e Baseline plus upper B greater than upper A plus upper BBe +
B > A + B, therefore upper A plus upper B less than 2 upper RA + B < 2R.

Deﬁnition 1.1.50 An angle of a triangle which is greater than a right angle is called 
an obtuse angle. An angle of a triangle which is less than a right angle is called an 
acute angle. 
Corollary 1.1.51 A triangle cannot have more than one obtuse angle. 
Proof Suppose there exists a triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC such that upper A greater than upper RA > R and upper B greater than upper RB > R. Then 
upper A plus upper B greater than 2 upper RA + B > 2R, in collision with the previous corollary.

We left for the reader the following very nice problems: 
Problema 1.1.52 Given a segmentleft bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB], there exists an unique pointupper MM (called the 
midpoint of the segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB]), such that left bracket upper A upper M right bracket identical to left bracket upper M upper B right bracket[AM] ≡[M B]. 
Problema 1.1.53 Given an angle angle h k∠hk, there is an unique half-line ll in its interior 
such that angle h l identical to angle l k∠hl ≡∠lk (the half-line ll is called the bisector of the angle h k∠hk). 
The previous problems create an inﬁnity of points in the interior of a given segment 
and an inﬁnity of half-lines in the interior of an angle. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.54 The perpendicular line from a vertex of a triangle on the line 
which contains the opposite side is called an altitude (or height) of the triangle. 
Theorem 1.1.55 At least one altitude among the three altitudes of a triangle lies in 
the interior of the triangle. 
Proof (Hint) Consider the altitude corresponding to the greatest angle of a triangle,

Proof Consider upper D element of left bracket upper A upper C right bracketD ∈[AC] such that left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper D right bracket[AB] ≡[AD]. It results  angle upper B greater than angle upper A upper B upper D identical to angle upper A upper D upper B greater than angle upper C∠B > ∠ABD ≡

If left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AC] ≡[AB], then angle upper B identical to angle upper C∠B ≡∠C, contradiction.

The reader observes that until now there is no a parallelism axiom involved in the 
construction we made. We are still in the absolute geometry area mentioned at the 
beginning of this chapter. The previous result is an important one. In the axiomatic 
frame created before it exists at least one non-secant line through a point with respect

The axioms before allow us to have inﬁnitely many points on a line, but we don’t 
know if a line can be “ﬁlled” with points or if it is “unbounded”. Until now we can

Since even ifleft bracket upper O upper E Subscript n Baseline right bracket equals left bracket upper O upper E 1 right bracket plus left bracket upper E 1 upper E 2 right bracket plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus left bracket upper E Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper E Subscript n Baseline right bracket less than left bracket upper O upper E Subscript n plus 1 Baseline right bracket[OEn] = [OE1] + [E1E2] + · · · + [En−1En] <
[OEn+1] the following example of segments bigger and bigger is bounded in the seg-
ment left bracket 0 comma 1 right bracket[0, 1]. It is about the sequence of intervals left parenthesis 0 comma 1 minus StartFraction 1 Over n EndFraction right parenthesis comma n element of double struck upper N period(0, 1 −1
n ), n ∈N. Can we make  
any connection between the set of real numbers and the points of a line? We need to 
introduce the axioms of continuity at this point. 
Axiombold upper C Subscript bold 1C1 (Axiom of Archimedes): Let left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] and left bracket upper C upper D right bracket[C D] be two arbitrary segments 
such thatleft bracket upper C upper D right bracket less than left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[C D] < [AB]. Then, there exists a ﬁnite number of pointsupper A 1 comma upper A 2 comma period period period upper A Subscript n Baseline comma period period periodA1, A2, ...An, ...
on the ray left parenthesis upper A upper B(AB, such that left bracket upper C upper D right bracket identical to left bracket upper A upper A 1 right bracket identical to left bracket upper A 1 upper A 2 right bracket identical to left bracket upper A 2 upper A 3 right bracket identical to midline horizontal ellipsis identical to left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript n Baseline right bracket[C D] ≡[AA1] ≡[A1A2] ≡[A2 A3] ≡· · · ≡[An−1An], 
the interiors of those segments have every two an empty intersection and ﬁnally, 
either upper B equals upper A Subscript nB = An or upper B element of left parenthesis upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript n Baseline right parenthesisB ∈(An−1 An). 
In view of the additivity property of segments we can write that it exists n element of double struck upper Nn ∈N
such that 
left bracket upper A upper A 1 right bracket plus left bracket upper A 1 upper A 2 right bracket plus left bracket upper A 2 upper A 3 right bracket plus midline horizontal ellipsis plus left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript n Baseline right bracket identical to n left bracket upper C upper D right bracket greater than or equals left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AA1] + [A1A2] + [A2 A3] + · · · + [An−1 An] ≡n[C D] ≥[AB]
and the inequality may refer to values. The Axiom of Archimedes multiplies values 
by natural numbers and we expect to understand the value of a segment as a real 
positive number describing the length of the segment. Considering n equals 1n = 1 in the 
previous inequality, we have the old inequality between segments, thereforebold upper C Subscript 1C1 offer 
us the chance to understand the appropriate nature of values attached to the segments 
and the unboundedness of the set of natural numbers. 
The next axiom is attributed to Cantor and it will be involved in “completing” the 
line with points we don’t know until now that they have to belong to a line. 
Axiom upper C bold 2C2 (Axiom of Cantor): Let left bracket upper A 1 upper B 1 right bracket comma left bracket upper A 2 upper B 2 right bracket comma period period period[A1B1], [A2B2], ... be a sequence of segments 
on a given linell, such that every segment is included in the interior of the precedent 
one, i.e.left bracket upper A Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n Baseline right bracket subset of left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper B Subscript n minus 1 Baseline right bracket[An Bn] ⊂[An−1Bn−1] for alln greater than or equals 2n ≥2. If we assume that no segment is included 
in the interior of all segments left bracket upper A Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n Baseline right bracket comma n element of double struck upper N[An Bn], n ∈N, then there is an unique point upper MM on 
the line ll such that StartSet upper M EndSet equals left bracket upper A 1 upper B 1 right bracket intersection left bracket upper A 2 upper B 2 right bracket midline horizontal ellipsis intersection left bracket upper A Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n Baseline right bracket intersection midline horizontal ellipsis{M} = [A1B1] ∩[A2B2] · · · ∩[An Bn] ∩· · ·
These two axioms of continuity allow us to use real positive numbers as the 
“values” of segments and angles. The results are a little bit more complicated and 
we try to suggest them without complete proofs. 
Using the continuity axiombold upper C Subscript 1C1 we can assign the natural number11 to the segment 
left bracket upper C upper D right bracket[C D] and the number nn to the value n upper C upper DnC D. To every segment left bracket upper A upper B right bracket[AB] we attach a 
system of coordinates on the line d equals upper A upper Bd = AB such that upper AA is the origin upper OO and 1 equals upper O upper A 1 equals upper A 1 upper A 2 equals midline horizontal ellipsis equals upper A Subscript m minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript m Baseline equals midline horizontal ellipsis1 =
O A1 = A1A2 = · · · = Am−1Am = · · · . According tobold upper C Subscript 1C1 it exists one integerm element of double struck upper Nm ∈N
such that upper B element of left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript n Baseline right bracketB ∈[An−1An]. If  upper B equals upper A Subscript n minus 1B = An−1 then upper A upper B equals n minus 1AB = n −1. If  upper B equals upper A Subscript nB = An then upper A upper B equals nAB = n. 
If upper B equals upper M 1B = M1 is the midpoint of the segment left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript n Baseline right bracket[An−1An] we assign to the value upper A upper BAB is 
the 2-adic number n minus 1 comma 10000 period period .0 period periodn −1, 10000...0... In fact at each step from now when upper BB is the 
midpoint of a segment, we associate 11 and the other decimals after are 00. Suppose 
upper B element of left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper M 1 right bracketB ∈[An−1M1]. We consider the value ofupper A upper BAB asModifyingAbove n minus 1 With quotation dash comma 0n −1, 0 and we are looking after the 
next decimal observing where upper BB is with respect to the midpoint upper M 2M2 of the segment 
left bracket upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper M 1 right bracket[An−1M1]. If  upper B element of left bracket upper M 2 upper M 1 right bracketB ∈[M2M1] the next decimal is 11, therefore the attached number is

continue to discover digits until upper BB is a midpoint of a segment when we stop with a

all segments which are like in axiom bold upper C Subscript 2C2. The real number

left” segment, is the 2-adic number attached to the value of the segment upper A upper BAB. 
Then we can show that to every real number we can assign a unique point on ll. 
The theory can be extended to angles with the following two theorems. 
Theorem 1.1.62 Letleft parenthesis a 1 comma b 1 right parenthesis comma left parenthesis a 2 comma b 2 right parenthesis comma period period period(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ... be a sequence of angles with common ver-
texupper OO, with the property that the angleleft parenthesis a Subscript n plus 1 Baseline comma b Subscript n plus 1 Baseline right parenthesis(an+1, bn+1) is contained in the angleleft parenthesis a Subscript n Baseline comma b Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis(an, bn), 
for all n greater than or equals 1n ≥1. In the assumption that there is no angle contained in the interior of 
all angles in the sequence, then there is a unique half-linell in the intersection of the 
interior of all angles. 
Proof (Hint) Intersect all angles with a line ll and denote the points of intersection 
with a Subscript kak by upper A Subscript kAk and the points of intersection with b Subscript kbk with upper B Subscript kBk, etc.
▢
Theorem 1.1.63 Letangle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis∠(hk) andangle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,) be two angles. There exists a natural num-
ber nn such that n angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis greater than angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesisn∠(hk) > ∠(h,k,). 
Proof (Hint) Observe that the measure of the angle angle left parenthesis h prime k prime right parenthesis∠(h,k,) is less than 2 upper R2R. If  
angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis greater than upper R∠(hk) > R we take n equals 2n = 2. If upper R greater than angle left parenthesis h k right parenthesis greater than StartFraction upper R Over 2 EndFractionR > ∠(hk) > R
2 we take n equals 4n = 4, etc.
▢
We have two statements for angles analogous with the axiomsbold upper C Subscript 1C1 andbold upper C Subscript 2C2. We can 
develop a similar theory for deﬁning measure of angles, restricting all the proofs in the 
case of segments to the intervalleft parenthesis 0 comma 2 upper R right parenthesis(0, 2R). Then, there is a one-to-one correspondence 
between the set of angles and the interval left parenthesis 0 comma 2 upper R right parenthesis(0, 2R) of the real numbers. 
We prove now in the Absolute Geometry frame the most important result regarding 
the sum of the angles of a triangle (Fig. 1.8). 
Theorem 1.1.64 (Legendre) For any triangle, the sum of its angles is at most 2 upper R2R.
1.1 Absolute Geometry

Proof Consider the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC. We have to show  angle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C less than or equals 2 upper R∠A + ∠B + ∠C ≤2R. By  
contradiction, let us assume thatangle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C greater than 2 upper R∠A + ∠B + ∠C > 2R. On the lineupper B upper CBC we consider 
the pointsupper B equals upper B 1 comma upper C equals upper B 2 comma upper B 3 comma period period period comma upper B Subscript n Baseline comma upper B Subscript n plus 1 BaselineB = B1, C = B2, B3, ..., Bn, Bn+1 in this order such thatupper B 1 upper B 2 equals upper B 2 upper B 3 equals midline horizontal ellipsis equals upper B Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n plus 1B1B2 = B2B3 =
· · · = Bn Bn+1 and in the same half-plane the points upper A equals upper A 1 comma upper A 2 comma upper A 3 comma period period period comma upper A Subscript n Baseline commaA = A1, A2, A3, ..., An, such 
that white up pointing triangle upper A 1 upper B 1 upper B 2 identical to white up pointing triangle upper A 2 upper B 2 upper B 3 identical to midline horizontal ellipsis white up pointing triangle upper A Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n plus 1ΔA1B1B2 ≡ΔA2B2B3 ≡· · · ΔAn Bn Bn+1. It is easy to see that the follow-
ing triangles are congruent, white up pointing triangle upper A 1 upper B 2 upper A 2 identical to white up pointing triangle upper A 2 upper B 3 upper A 3 identical to midline horizontal ellipsis white up pointing triangle upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper B Subscript n Baseline upper A Subscript nΔA1B2 A2 ≡ΔA2B3A3 ≡· · · ΔAn−1Bn An, therefore 
upper A 1 upper A 2 equals upper A 2 upper A 3 equals midline horizontal ellipsis equals upper A Subscript n minus 1 Baseline upper A Subscript nA1A2 = A2 A3 = · · · = An−1 An. It is easy to deduce thatangle upper A greater than angle upper A 1 upper B 2 upper A 2∠A > ∠A1B2 A2 and then 
upper B upper C equals upper B 1 upper B 2 greater than upper A 1 upper A 2BC = B1B2 > A1A2. The polygonal line upper B 1 upper A 1 upper A 2 period period upper A Subscript n Baseline upper B Subscript n plus 1 BaselineB1A1A2..An Bn+1 is bigger than the seg-
ment upper B 1 upper B Subscript n plus 1 Baseline equals n upper B upper CB1Bn+1 = nBC, that is 
n upper B upper C less than upper B upper A plus left parenthesis n minus 1 right parenthesis upper A 1 upper A 2 plus upper A upper C periodnBC < B A + (n −1)A1A2 + AC.
This one can be written in the form 
left parenthesis n minus 1 right parenthesis left parenthesis upper B upper C minus upper A 1 upper A 2 right parenthesis less than upper B upper A minus upper B upper C plus upper A upper C period(n −1)(BC −A1A2) < B A −BC + AC.
We know that upper B upper C minus upper A 1 upper A 2 greater than 0 comma upper B upper A minus upper B upper C plus upper A upper C greater than 0 commaBC −A1A2 > 0, B A −BC + AC > 0, i.e. there exists the seg-
ments left bracket upper S upper T right bracket comma left bracket upper M upper K right bracket[ST ], [MK] such that upper B upper C minus upper A 1 upper A 2 equals upper S upper T comma upper B upper A minus upper B upper C plus upper A upper C equals upper M upper KBC −A1A2 = ST, B A −BC + AC = MK and 
left parenthesis n minus 1 right parenthesis upper S upper T less than upper M upper K(n −1)ST < MK. But in the last inequality the natural number nn is arbitrary, in 
collision with bold upper C Subscript 1C1. Therefore angle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C∠A + ∠B + ∠C cannot be greater than 2 upper R2R. It follows  
angle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C less than or equals 2 upper R∠A + ∠B + ∠C ≤2R.
▢
The next deﬁnition takes care that the values of angles are real numbers. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.65 For any triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC we deﬁne the defect of it, denoted 
script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesisD(ABC), to be script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesis equals 2 upper R minus angle upper A minus angle upper B minus angle upper CD(ABC) = 2R −∠A −∠B −∠C. 
Legendre’s theorem states that script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesis greater than or equals 0D(ABC) ≥0 for any triangle. Let us investigate 
what other properties the defect of triangles may have. 
Theorem 1.1.66 If upper P element of left parenthesis upper B upper C right parenthesisP ∈(BC), where left bracket upper B upper C right bracket[BC] is a side of the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC, then 
script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper P upper B right parenthesis plus script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper P upper C right parenthesis equals script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesisD(AP B) + D(APC) = D(ABC). 
Proof (Hint) Denote by angle upper A 1 equals angle upper B upper A upper P comma angle upper A 2 equals angle upper C upper A upper P comma angle upper P 1 equals angle upper A upper P upper B comma angle upper P 2 equals angle upper A upper P upper C∠A1 = ∠B AP, ∠A2 = ∠C AP, ∠P1 = ∠AP B, ∠P2 =
∠APC and observe that angle upper A 1 plus angle upper A 2 equals angle upper A comma angle upper P 1 plus angle upper P 2 equals 2 upper R∠A1 + ∠A2 = ∠A, ∠P1 + ∠P2 = 2R. Then 
script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper P upper B right parenthesis plus script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper P upper C right parenthesis equals 2 upper R minus angle upper A 1 minus angle upper P 1 minus angle upper B plus 2 upper R minus angle upper A 2 minus angle upper P 2 minus angle upper C equalsD(AP B) + D(APC) = 2R −∠A1 −∠P1 −∠B + 2R −∠A2 −∠P2 −∠C =
equals 2 upper R minus angle upper A minus angle upper B minus angle upper C equals script upper D left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesis period = 2R −∠A −∠B −∠C = D(ABC).

If “the big triangle”white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC hasscript upper D left parenthesis upper A upper B upper C right parenthesis equals 0D(ABC) = 0, then, mandatory “the small trian-

Pay attention to the following construction. 
Consider a right-angle triangle white up pointing triangle upper B upper A upper C comma angle upper A equals upper RΔB AC, ∠A = R with script upper D left parenthesis upper B upper A upper C right parenthesis equals 0D(B AC) = 0. In this case 
observe thatangle upper B plus angle upper C equals upper R∠B + ∠C = R and constructupper DD in the opposite half-plane with respect 
to upper B upper CBC and upper AA such that white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper C identical to white up pointing triangle upper D upper B upper CΔABC ≡ΔDBC. It results in a quadrilateral upper A upper B upper D upper CABDC
such that all angles are equal to upper RR, and the opposite sides are equal, i.e. left bracket upper A upper B right bracket identical to left bracket upper C upper D right bracket comma left bracket upper A upper C right bracket identical to left bracket upper B upper D right bracket[AB] ≡
[C D], [AC] ≡[BD]. We may call this ﬁgure rectangle and it is easy to discover 
two more properties. The diagonals upper A upper DAD and upper B upper CBC are congruent and they cut in the 
middle of each one. Let us rename the rectangle upper A upper B upper D upper CABDC by upper A 00 upper A 10 upper A 11 upper A 01A00 A10 A11A01. 
We intend to pave the plane with tiles congruent to our created rectangle

theorem. 
Theorem 1.1.68 If there exists a right-angle triangle with defect 00, then all right-
angle triangles have defect 00, i.e. the sum of their angles is 2 upper R2R. 
Proof Consider the right-angle triangle to be white up pointing triangle upper B upper A upper C comma angle upper A equals upper RΔB AC, ∠A = R and script upper D left parenthesis upper B upper A upper C right parenthesis equals 0D(B AC) = 0
and let a general right-angle triangle white up pointing triangle upper E upper F upper G comma angle upper F equals upper RΔE FG, ∠F = R. According to Archimedes’

Theorem 1.1.69 If there exists a triangle with defect00, then all triangles have defect 
00, i.e. the sum of their angles is 2 upper R2R. 
Proof Consider a triangle with defect 00, say  white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC. It exists an altitude which 
intersects the opposite side in its interior, say upper A upper T comma upper T element of left parenthesis upper B upper C right parenthesisAT, T ∈(BC). The altitude and 
the sides of the triangle determine two right-angle triangles, white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper TΔABT and white up pointing triangle upper A upper T upper CΔATC, 
both with00 defect, because the initial triangle is with00 defect. The previous theorem 
asserts that all right-angle triangles have00 defect. Now, consider an arbitrary triangle 
white up pointing triangle upper D upper E upper FΔDE F. Suppose that the altitude which intersects the opposite side is upper D upper P comma upper P element of left parenthesis upper E upper F right parenthesisDP, P ∈
(E F). The two right-angle triangleswhite up pointing triangle upper D upper F upper PΔDF P andwhite up pointing triangle upper D upper E upper PΔDE P are with00 defect, therefore 
the defect of the triangle white up pointing triangle upper D upper E upper FΔDE F is 00.
▢
There are only two situations that can happen. All the triangles have the sum of 
angles2 upper R2R or all the triangles have the sum of angles strictly less than2 upper R2R. In the given 
context we cannot decide about the sum. The next axioms will clarify this aspect. 
Deﬁnition 1.1.70 The collection of all properties and results deduced from all 
axioms of incidence, order, congruence, and continuity above is called an absolute 
geometry. 
1.2 
From Absolute Geometry to Euclidean Geometry 
Through Euclidean Parallelism Axiom 
The question we asked before is how many non-secant lines can be constructed 
through an exterior point to a given line. We know that at least one can be con-
structed. Could there be two or more? The standard Euclidean Parallelism Axiom is 
stated as follows. 
Axiom P: Given any line in a plane and given any point not incident to the given 
line, there exists at most one line that passes through the given and it is non-secant 
to the given line. 
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 The collection of all properties and results deduced from all axioms 
of incidence, order, congruence, continuity, and Euclidean parallelism above is called 
as Euclidean geometry. 
A direct consequence: In Euclidean geometry, i.e. in the axiomatic frame created

Fig. 1.9 Axiom of Euclidean parallelism 
non-secant to the given linedd. This unique non-secant line is called the parallel line 
to the given line dd through the given point upper AA (Fig. 1.9). 
Theorem 1.2.2 In Euclidean geometry, the sum of angles of any triangle is 2 upper R2R. 
Proof Consider a triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC and the unique parallel through upper AA to upper B upper CBC. We  
have in mind the ﬁgure of Theorem 23 where the parallel was upper F upper EFE with upper A element of upper F upper EA ∈FE. 
The interior alternate anglesangle upper E upper A upper C∠E AC andangle upper A upper C upper B∠AC B are equal. The same for the interior 
alternate angles angle upper F upper A upper B∠F AB and angle upper A upper B upper C∠ABC. Therefore, if we look at the angle angle upper F upper A upper E∠F AE we 
observe that it is equal to the sum of the angles of the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC and, in the 
same time, it has the value 2 upper R2R. Since this particular triangle has the sum of angles 
equal to 2 upper R2R, all other triangles have the sum of angles equal to 2 upper R2R.
▢
In the case of the ﬁgure, angle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C equals angle upper A plus alpha plus beta equals 2 upper R period∠A + ∠B + ∠C = ∠A + α + β = 2R.
Sinceangle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C equals 2 upper R∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 2R, we deduce2 upper R minus angle upper A equals angle upper B plus angle upper C period2R −∠A = ∠B + ∠C. But2 upper R minus angle upper A2R −∠A
is the value of the exterior angle upper AA. 
Corollary 1.2.3 (Exterior Angle Theorem in the Euclidean Geometry) For every 
triangle, each exterior angle is the sum of the interior non-adjacent angles. 
Theorem 1.2.4 If it exists a triangle with the sum of its angles equal to 2 upper R2R the 
parallelism axiom is satisﬁed. 
Proof Assume that there exists a triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC with angle upper A plus angle upper B plus angle upper C equals 2 upper R∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 2R. 
Therefore every triangle has the same property. 
Let dd be a line and upper MM a point not on dd. Let  upper M upper NM N be the perpendicular line from 
upper MM to dd, upper N element of dN ∈d. Let  ll be a perpendicular to upper M upper NM N in upper MM. We know that ll and dd are 
non-secant lines. We have to prove thatll is the only non-secant line throughupper MM todd. 
Consider another line l primel, passing through upper MM and denote by alphaα the acute angle 
between upper M upper NM N and l primel,. 
It makes sense to consider a triangle upper M prime upper N prime upper P primeM,N ,P, such that

and angle upper M prime upper P prime upper N Superscript prime Baseline equals upper R minus alpha∠M,P,N , = R −α (without to know that upper R comma alpha comma upper R minus alphaR, α, R −α are the angles of a tri-
angle, we do not know that only the angles upper RR and alphaα together with the side upper M prime upper N primeM,N ,
determine a triangle). 
Considering upper P element of dP ∈d with left bracket upper N upper P right bracket identical to left bracket upper N prime upper P prime right bracket [N P] ≡[N ,P,], the triangles white up pointing triangle upper M upper N upper PΔM N P and white up pointing triangle upper M prime upper N prime upper P primeΔM,N ,P,
are congruent and one of the half-line of l primel, is coincident to upper M upper PM P. Therefore l prime intersection d equals StartSet upper P EndSetl, ∩d =
{P}, i.e. ll is the unique non-secant line through upper MM to dd.

The story of Euclidean Geometry may continue with many theorems which can 
be proven only in this axiomatic frame. But we are interested in introducing non-
Euclidean parallelism and models of non-Euclidean geometry. Therefore we remain 
in the axiomatic frame corresponding to the axioms of incidence, order, congruence, 
and continuity and, at this moment, we add another axiom, more speciﬁc the denial 
of the Axiom of Euclidean parallelism. 
1.3 
From Absolute Geometry to Non-Euclidean Geometry 
Through Non-Euclidean Parallelism Axiom 
The Euclidean parallelism axiom, in the set theoretical language, can be written as 
for all d comma for all upper A not an element of d comma number sign left brace a vertical bar upper A element of a comma a intersection d equals normal empty set right brace less than or equals 1 comma∀d, ∀A /∈d, #{a | A ∈a, a ∩d = ∅} ≤1,
wherenumber sign# denotes the number of elements of a set. In what follows we assume the nega-
tion of the previous axiom, and we call this the axiom of non-Euclidean parallelism. 
In set theory language, this translates to 
there exists d 0 comma there exists upper A 0 not an element of d 0 comma number sign left brace a vertical bar upper A 0 element of a comma a intersection d 0 equals normal empty set right brace greater than or equals 1 period∃d0, ∃A0 /∈d0, #{a | A0 ∈a, a ∩d0 = ∅} ≥1.
Therefore the axiom of non-Euclidean parallelism is the following. 
Axiom upper P upper N 0 colonPN0 : There exist both a line d 0d0 and a point upper A 0A0 exterior to d 0d0 with the 
property: at least two non-secant lines to d 0d0 passing through upper A 0A0 exist. 
Deﬁnition 1.3.1 The collection of all properties and results deduced from all axioms 
of incidence, order, congruence, continuity, and non-Euclidean parallelism above is 
called a non-Euclidean geometry. 
We study below some important results in the context of this geometry. 
Theorem 1.3.2 Axiom upper P upper N 0PN0 acts as a global property, i.e. it holds for any line and 
any exterior point.

Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries: How They Appear
Proof By contradiction, we assume that there is a pointupper AA and a linedd which do not  
satisfy the property “there are at least two non-secant lines todd, passing throughupper AA”. 
Then, throughupper AA passes exactly one non-secant line todd. So, the Axiom P is satisﬁed 
for the pairleft parenthesis upper A comma d right parenthesis(A, d). If we chooseupper BB andupper CC ondd, it is easy to see that the sum of angles 
of the triangle white up pointing triangle upper A upper B upper CΔABC is 2 upper R2R, and this is equivalent as we saw before with Axiom P 
for all pairs left parenthesis upper M comma l right parenthesis comma upper M not an element of l(M,l), M /∈l, in collision with our assumption.
▢
We can restate the axiom of non-Euclidean geometry as follows. 
Axiom PN: Given a line and a point exterior to the line, there exists at least two 
non-secant lines to the given line. 
It is easy to prove 
Theorem 1.3.3 Let ll be a given line in a plane and upper AA be an exterior point to ll. Let 
a 1a1 and a 2a2 be two lines in the same plane which pass through upper AA and are non-secant 
to ll. Then every line aa passing through upper AA and included in the interior of the angle 
angle a 1 a 2∠a1a2 is non-secant to ll. 
Proof (Hint) Ifaa intersectsll, then it does intersecta 1a1 ora 2a2, in collision with the fact 
that aa is included in the interior of the angle angle a 1 a 2∠a1a2.
▢
Corollary 1.3.4 In non-Euclidean geometry there are an inﬁnite number of non-
secant lines to a given line through an exterior point. 
Theorem 1.3.5 In a geometry which satisﬁes the groups of axioms of incidence, 
order, congruence, continuity, and the Axiom NP, the sum of angles of a triangle is 
less than 2 upper R2R. 
Proof (Hint) If it exists a triangle with the sum of angles equal to 2 upper R2R, then Axiom 
P is valid, contradiction.
▢
We conclude that the non-Euclidean geometry established by the absolute geome-
try together with the Axiom NP is completely different than the Euclidean geometry 
established by the absolute geometry together with Axiom P. More other interesting 
results may be found in both geometries, but in the following, we are interested in 
offering examples of models of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries.

Basic Facts in Euclidean and Minkowski

Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem. 
W. Ockham 
In Chap. 1, we found out that there exist different geometries in a plane. It depends 
on the axioms one chooses if Euclidean Geometry or Non-Euclidean Geometry is 
described. But how these geometries look like? In this chapter we present an algebraic 
model for Euclidean Geometry discussing some important theorems. We obtain a 
visual representation for the Euclidean Geometry of the plane. Making small changes 
in the algebraic construction of the Euclidean Geometry, it is possible to construct 
a Minkowski Geometry. This Geometry is deeply involved both with Physics and 
with Non-Euclidean Geometry. Later, we see how the models of Non-Euclidean 
Geometry are connected between them and how a Minkowski one is among them. 
The geometric objects in Minkowski Geometry seem to have a non-intuitive look, but 
the main theorems have a similar look with their Euclidean counterparts. Generally, 
Non-Euclidean models are more sophisticated and we need more mathematical tools 
in order to build them. This happens in the following chapters. One more comment: 
this chapter is not as formal as the previous one where we used the language style 
of an axiomatic theory. We can relax a little bit the mathematical language structure. 
The deﬁnitions appear often written as part of a mathematical algebraic description of 
geometric objects and italic letters are used to indicate them. The following notation 
is used: upper A colon equals upper BA := B. It means that the object upper AA from the left side of the equality is 
described by deﬁnition through the object expression upper BB from the right part of the 
equality. The word iff has the meaning of “if and only if”.

Basic Facts in Euclidean and Minkowski Plane Geometry
2.1 
Pythagoras Theorems in Euclidean Plane 
The idea to consider a system of coordinates on a line was discussed in the previous 
chapter. 
The coordinates are real numbers and their set, geometrically represented as a 
line, is denoted by double struck upper RR. In the following we suppose known 
bullet• the set of natural numbers denoted by double struck upper NN, 
bullet• the set of integers denoted by double struck upper ZZ, 
bullet• the set of rational numbers denoted by double struck upper QQ, and 
bullet• the set of irrational numbers denoted by double struck upper R minus double struck upper QR −Q. 
In the same time we have proved that the values of angles are real numbers. 
Basic facts about matrix theory, groups, vector spaces, trigonometric, exponential, 
and logarithms functions are suppose known by the reader interested in the topic of 
this book. 
When we are talking about a model of Euclidean Geometry in a plane, we have to 
start from the vector space double struck upper R squaredR2 over the ﬁeld double struck upper RR. x colon equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis comma y colon equals left parenthesis y 1 comma y 2 right parenthesisx := (x1, x2), y := (y1, y2) are 
called vectors. The vector space operations are x plus y colon equals left parenthesis x 1 plus y 1 comma x 2 plus y 2 right parenthesisx + y := (x1 + y1, x2 + y2) and 
lamda x colon equals left parenthesis lamda x 1 comma lamda x 2 right parenthesisλx := (λx1, λx2). 
The Euclidean inner product of the vectors xx and yy is deﬁned by 
left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket colon equals x 1 y 1 plus x 2 y 2 ❬x, y❭:= x1y1 + x2y2
and the norm of xx, by StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue colon equals StartRoot left angle bracket x comma x right angle bracket EndRoot equals StartRoot x 1 squared plus x 2 squared EndRoot|x| := √❬x, x❭=

2. 
Two vectors are called Euclidean orthogonal (or Euclidean perpendicular) if their 
inner product is null. 
According to the operations, the vector left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis(x1, x2) can be thought as x 1 left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesis plus x 2 left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesisx1(1, 0) +
x2(0, 1), that is left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis equals x 1 left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesis plus x 2 left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesis equals x 1 e 1 plus x 2 e 2(x1, x2) = x1(1, 0) + x2(0, 1) = x1e1 + x2e2 so, the pair left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis(x1, x2)
can be seen also as a pair of coordinates of a point upper AA of the plane. 
The line determined by x e 1 comma x element of double struck upper Rxe1, x ∈R is called the xx-axis, and the line determined 
by y e 2 comma y element of double struck upper Rye2, y ∈R is called the yy-axis. 
Therefore, in the system of coordinates generated by the orthogonal vectors 
e 1 equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesis semicolon e 2 equals left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesis commae1 = (1, 0); e2 = (0, 1), the geometric meaning of the vector x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesisx = (x1, x2) is the

If StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue equals 1|x| = 1, then StartAbsoluteValue upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue equals 1 period|Aαx| = |x| = 1. Denote by uu the unitary vector upper A Subscript alpha Baseline xAαx. The pre-
vious relation for the unitary vectors u comma xu, x can be written in the form left angle bracket u comma x right angle bracket equals cosine alpha❬u, x❭= cos α. 
We can see the vectoruu as the rotation of the vectorxx, so the angle between these 
two vectors is alphaα. For two arbitrary vectors a comma ba, b, the vectors StartFraction a Over StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction comma StartFraction b Over StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction a
|a|, b

the previous relation becomes

i.e. 
StartFraction left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket Over StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction equals cosine alpha period❬a, b❭
|a||b| = cos α.
This last formula is known as the Generalized Pythagoras Theorem. Let us discuss 
why (Fig. 2.1). 
Since we have the vectors a equals left parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesis comma b equals left parenthesis b 1 comma b 2 right parenthesisa = (a1, a2), b = (b1, b2), we can think about the

Before continuing, we point out the meaning of the Euclidean Parallelism in this 
coordinate frame. 
Let us consider upper M left parenthesis m 1 comma m 2 right parenthesisM(m1, m2) and upper N left parenthesis n 1 comma n 2 right parenthesisN(n1, n2).

If the line dd passes through upper A left parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesis semicolon upper B left parenthesis b 1 comma b 2 right parenthesisA(a1, a2); B(b1, b2) the equation of dd is 
y minus a 2 equals StartFraction a 2 minus b 2 Over a 1 minus b 1 EndFraction left parenthesis x minus a 1 right parenthesis periody −a2 = a2 −b2
a1 −b1
(x −a1).
The ratio denoted by mm, m colon equals StartFraction a 2 minus b 2 Over a 1 minus b 1 EndFractionm := a2 −b2
a1 −b1
is called a slope for the line dd. The slope mm
has the value m equals tangent alpham = tan α, where alphaα is the angle between the upper O xOx and dd in this order. 
Exercise 2.1.10 Show that two lines d 1d1 and d 2d2 are Euclidean perpendicular iff 
m 1 m 2 equals negative 1m1m2 = −1. 
Hint. Use Euclidean exterior angle theorem and tangent left parenthesis alpha plus beta right parenthesistan(α + β) formula. 
The equation of a circle centred atleft parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesis(a1, a2) with radiusrr is expressed with respect 
to the Euclidean distance between the centre and a point left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis(x, y) on the circle: 
left parenthesis x minus a 1 right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis y minus a 2 right parenthesis squared equals r squared period(x −a1)2 + (y −a2)2 = r2.
The interior of a circleupper CC is denoted byi n t upper CintC and, between the two regions in which a 
circle divides the plane, it is the region containing its centre. The Euclidean distance 
between the centre and a point belonging to this region is less than the radius. The 
complementary region is called the exterior of the circle. The Euclidean distance 
between the centre and a point belonging to this region is greater than the radius.
2.2 Space-Like, Time-Like, and Null Vectors in Minkowski Plane

There are many properties related to circles and lines attached to triangles in the 
Euclidean Geometry. Some of them will be studied in the next chapter. The Euclidean 
plane is denoted by upper E squaredE2. 
2.2 
Space-Like, Time-Like, and Null Vectors in Minkowski 
Plane 
When we are talking about a model of Minkowski Geometry in a plane, we have to 
start from the same vector spacedouble struck upper R squaredR2 over the ﬁelddouble struck upper RR. Here,x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis comma y equals left parenthesis y 1 comma y 2 right parenthesisx = (x1, x2), y = (y1, y2)
are called vectors, as in the Euclidean case. 
The vector space operations are the samex plus y colon equals left parenthesis x 1 plus y 1 comma x 2 plus y 2 right parenthesisx + y := (x1 + y1, x2 + y2) andlamda x colon equals left parenthesis lamda x 1 comma lamda x 2 right parenthesisλx :=
(λx1, λx2). 
The Minkowski product of the vectors xx and yy is deﬁned by 
left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline colon equals x 1 y 1 minus x 2 y 2 ❬x, y❭M := x1y1 −x2y2
and the Minkowski norm of xx by StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline colon equals StartRoot StartAbsoluteValue left angle bracket x comma x right angle bracket EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline EndRoot equals StartRoot StartAbsoluteValue x 1 squared minus x 2 squared EndAbsoluteValue EndRoot|x|M := √| ❬x, x❭|M =

2|. 
Two vectors are called Minkowski orthogonal if their Minkowski product is null. 
In a system of coordinates generated by the Minkowski orthogonal vectors e 1 equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesis semicolon e 2 equals left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesis commae1 =
(1, 0); e2 = (0, 1), the geometric meaning of the vector x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesisx = (x1, x2) is the oriented 
segment ModifyingAbove upper O upper A With right arrow
→
O A, lying from the origin upper OO with the coordinates left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0) and the endpoint 
upper AA with the coordinates left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis(x1, x2). This is exact as in the Euclidean case. 
Even the parallelism is like in the Euclidean case. Consider upper M left parenthesis m 1 comma m 2 right parenthesisM(m1, m2) and 
upper N left parenthesis n 1 comma n 2 right parenthesisN(n1, n2). 
Deﬁnition 2.2.1 The linesupper A upper BAB andupper M upper NM N are parallel and we denote this byupper M upper N StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue upper A upper B commaM N||AB,
if the vectorsModifyingAbove upper O upper D With right arrow equals left parenthesis m 1 minus n 1 comma m 2 minus n 2 right parenthesis
→
O D= (m1 −n1, m2 −n2) andModifyingAbove upper O upper C With right arrow equals left parenthesis a 1 minus b 1 comma a 2 minus b 2 right parenthesis
→
OC= (a1 −b1, a2 −b2) are collinear, 
i.e. there exists beta not equals 0∃β /= 0 such that left parenthesis m 1 minus n 1 comma m 2 minus n 2 right parenthesis equals beta left parenthesis a 1 minus b 1 comma a 2 minus b 2 right parenthesis period(m1 −n1, m2 −n2) = β(a1 −b1, a2 −b2).
However, in a Minkowski space, we have three different kind of vectorsModifyingAbove upper O upper A With right arrow
→
O A. Let  
us explain. There are space-like vectors, time-like vectors, and null vectors. 
A vector xx is a space-like vector if left angle bracket x comma x right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline less than 0 period❬x, x❭M < 0.
Examples are b equals left parenthesis negative 1 comma 2 right parenthesisb = (−1, 2), e equals left parenthesis 2 comma negative 3 right parenthesise = (2, −3), or in general a equals left parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesisa = (a1, a2) with StartAbsoluteValue a 1 EndAbsoluteValue less than StartAbsoluteValue a 2 EndAbsoluteValue period|a1| <
|a2|.
A vector xx is a time-like vector if left angle bracket x comma x right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline greater than 0 period❬x, x❭M > 0.
Examples are b equals left parenthesis 3 comma 2 right parenthesisb = (3, 2), e equals left parenthesis negative 4 comma negative 3 right parenthesise = (−4, −3), or in general a equals left parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesisa = (a1, a2) with StartAbsoluteValue a 1 EndAbsoluteValue greater than StartAbsoluteValue a 2 EndAbsoluteValue period|a1| >
|a2|.
A vector xx is a null vector if left angle bracket x comma x right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals 0 period❬x, x❭M = 0.
Examples areb equals left parenthesis negative 1 comma 1 right parenthesisb = (−1, 1),e equals left parenthesis 2 comma 2 right parenthesise = (2, 2), or in generala equals left parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesisa = (a1, a2) withStartAbsoluteValue a 1 EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue a 2 EndAbsoluteValue period|a1| = |a2|.
The reader can observe that Minkowski orthogonal vectors have to be pairs, one 
space-like and one time-like. An example: x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis semicolon v equals left parenthesis k x 2 comma k x 1 right parenthesis periodx = (x1, x2); v = (kx2, kx1).

Basic Facts in Euclidean and Minkowski Plane Geometry
Consider the 2 times 22 × 2 “hyperbolic rotation” matrix upper A Subscript alpha Baseline equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column hyperbolic cosine alpha 2nd Column hyperbolic sine alpha 2nd Row 1st Column hyperbolic sine alpha 2nd Column hyperbolic cosine alpha EndMatrixAα =
(cosh α sinh α

)
in 
which the basic hyperbolic trigonometric functions sine and cosine are involved 
as components. 
hyperbolic sine alpha equals StartFraction e Superscript alpha Baseline minus e Superscript negative alpha Baseline Over 2 EndFraction comma hyperbolic cosine alpha equals StartFraction e Superscript alpha Baseline plus e Superscript negative alpha Baseline Over 2 EndFraction period sinh α = eα −e−α
2
, cosh α = eα + e−α
2
.
This matrix is called a hyperbolic rotation and this name is legitimate by the next 
quick exercises. 
As in the Euclidean case, upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x comma upper A Subscript alpha Baseline yAαx, Aαy are two matrices with two lines and one 
column, and it makes sense to consider the Minkowski product left angle bracket upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x comma upper A Subscript alpha Baseline y right angle bracket Subscript upper M❬Aαx, Aαy❭M. 
Exercise 2.2.2 left angle bracket upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x comma upper A Subscript alpha Baseline y right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript upper M❬Aαx, Aαy❭M = ❬x, y❭M. 
Hint. Use hyperbolic cosine squared alpha minus hyperbolic sine squared alpha equals 1 periodcosh2 α −sinh2 α = 1. Therefore 
left angle bracket upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x comma upper A Subscript alpha Baseline y right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals left parenthesis x 1 hyperbolic cosine alpha plus x 2 hyperbolic sine alpha right parenthesis left parenthesis y 1 hyperbolic cosine alpha plus y 2 hyperbolic sine alpha right parenthesis minus ❬Aαx, Aαy❭M = (x1 cosh α + x2 sinh α)(y1 cosh α + y2 sinh α) −
minus left parenthesis x 1 hyperbolic sine alpha plus x 2 hyperbolic cosine alpha right parenthesis left parenthesis y 1 hyperbolic sine alpha plus y 2 hyperbolic cosine alpha right parenthesis equals −(x1 sinh α + x2 cosh α)(y1 sinh α + y2 cosh α) =
equals x 1 y 1 minus x 2 y 2 equals left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript upper M = x1y1 −x2y2 = ❬x, y❭M
We leave the reader to prove that it does not exist alphaα such that upper A Subscript alpha Baseline e 1 equals e 2 periodAαe1 = e2.
Or, more general, after rotating a time-like (space-like) vector we cannot obtain a 
space-like (time-like) vector. As we will see below, this property is related to causality 
in Relativity. 
Exercise 2.2.3 StartAbsoluteValue upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline equals StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline period|Aαx|M = |x|M.
So, the matrices upper A Subscript alphaAα preserve the Minkowski type and the Minkowski length of 
vectors. 
Deﬁnition 2.2.4 Ifu equals upper A Subscript alpha Baseline vu = Aαv we say thatalphaα is the oriented hyperbolic angle between 
vv and uu. Obviously, negative alpha−α is the oriented hyperbolic angle between uu and vv. 
Next, we discuss about time-like vector properties. 
A future-pointing time-like vectorvv fulﬁlls the propertyleft angle bracket v comma e 1 right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline greater than 0❬v, e1❭M > 0. An example 
is v equals left parenthesis 3 comma 2 right parenthesis periodv = (3, 2).
Otherwise the vector vv is a past-pointing space-like vector. v equals left parenthesis negative 3 comma negative 2 right parenthesisv = (−3, −2) is an 
example, and the reader can observe that if we consider the lines d 1 colon x 2 equals x 1d1 : x2 = x1 and 
d 2 colon x 2 equals minus x 1d2 : x2 = −x1 which describe the null cone, a future-pointing time-like vector is 
a vector v equals ModifyingAbove upper O upper A With right arrowv =
→
O A with upper A equals left parenthesis a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesisA = (a1, a2) included in the interior of the angle angle d 1 d 2∠d1d2 (i.e. 
StartAbsoluteValue a 1 EndAbsoluteValue greater than StartAbsoluteValue a 2 EndAbsoluteValue|a1| > |a2|) such that a 1 greater than 0a1 > 0. 
Exercise 2.2.5 Ifvv is a future-pointing time-like vector, thenupper A Subscript alpha Baseline vAαv is a future-pointing 
time-like vector.
2.3 Minkowski–Pythagoras Theorems
37
Hint. Since we have proved that the time-like property is kept after a hyperbolic 
rotation, it remains to prove that the future-pointing property is preserved. 
Or left angle bracket upper A Subscript alpha Baseline v comma e 1 right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals a 1 hyperbolic cosine alpha plus a 2 hyperbolic sine alpha period❬Aαv, e1❭M = a1 cosh α + a2 sinh α.
We have StartAbsoluteValue a 1 EndAbsoluteValue greater than StartAbsoluteValue a 2 EndAbsoluteValue|a1| > |a2| and StartAbsoluteValue hyperbolic sine alpha EndAbsoluteValue less than hyperbolic cosine alpha| sinh α| < cosh α, i.e. StartAbsoluteValue a 1 hyperbolic cosine alpha EndAbsoluteValue greater than StartAbsoluteValue a 2 hyperbolic sine alpha EndAbsoluteValue|a1 cosh α| > |a2 sinh α|. 
It remains to observe that there are triangles in this Minkowski Geometry in which 
the meaning of angle does not exist. The triangles in which we can discuss about 
angles are called pure triangles, i.e. in such triangles all the sides are time vectors, all 
pointing towards the future (or, all pointing towards the past). How we can create such 
a triangle? We start with two, say, future-pointing time-like vectors,x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 right parenthesis comma y equals left parenthesis k y 1 comma k y 2 right parenthesisx = (x1, x2), y =
(ky1, ky2) and we choose k greater than 0k > 0 such that y minus x equals left parenthesis k y 1 minus x 1 comma k y 2 minus x 2 right parenthesisy −x = (ky1 −x1, ky2 −x2) is future-
pointing time-like vector. 
Exercise 2.2.6 If xx and yy are future-pointing time-like vectors then 
1. left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline greater than 0 semicolon❬x, y❭M > 0;
2. x plus yx + y is a future-pointing time-like vector; 
3. left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline less than or equals StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline StartAbsoluteValue y EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M❬x, y❭M ≤|x|M|y|M, where the equality happens iff y equals k x semicolony = kx;
4. StartAbsoluteValue x plus y EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline less than or equals StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline plus StartAbsoluteValue y EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M|x + y|M ≤|x|M + |y|M, the equality happens iff y equals k x periody = kx.
2.3 
Minkowski–Pythagoras Theorems 
Let us start with a simple exercise. 
Exercise 2.3.1 If xx is a space-like vector such that StartAbsoluteValue x EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline equals 1|x|M = 1 then left angle bracket upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x comma x right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals minus hyperbolic cosine alpha period❬Aαx, x❭M =
−cosh α.
Hint.
left angle bracket upper A Subscript alpha Baseline x comma x right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals left parenthesis x 1 hyperbolic cosine alpha plus x 2 hyperbolic sine alpha right parenthesis x 1 minus left parenthesis x 1 hyperbolic sine alpha plus x 2 hyperbolic cosine alpha right parenthesis x 2 equals left parenthesis x 1 squared minus x 2 squared right parenthesis hyperbolic cosine alpha equals minus hyperbolic cosine alpha period❬Aαx, x❭M = (x1 cosh α + x2 sinh α)x1 −(x1 sinh α + x2 cosh α)x2 =
(x2
1 −x2
2) cosh α = −cosh α.
Denote byuu the unitary vectorupper A Subscript alpha Baseline xAαx. The previous relation for the unitary vectors 
u comma xu, x can be written in the form left angle bracket u comma x right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals minus hyperbolic cosine alpha❬u, x❭M = −cosh α. 
For two arbitrary future-pointing space-like vectors a comma ba, b, the vectors StartFraction a Over StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline EndFraction comma StartFraction b Over StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue Subscript upper M Baseline EndFraction a
|a|M
,
b
|b|M
are unitary and the previous relation becomes

According to the Euclidean case, this last formula can be called the Generalized 
Minkowski–Pythagoras theorem.

Basic Facts in Euclidean and Minkowski Plane Geometry

is called a Minkowski hypotenuse, and upper O upper A comma upper O upper BO A, O B are called Minkowski legs of the 
triangle upper O upper A upper BO AB. 
An example is given by ModifyingAbove upper O upper A With right arrow equals left parenthesis 0 comma a right parenthesis comma a greater than 0 semicolon ModifyingAbove upper O upper B With right arrow equals left parenthesis b comma 0 right parenthesis comma b greater than 0

O A= (0, a), a > 0;
→
O B= (b, 0), b > 0. When we 
consider the vector ModifyingAbove upper A upper B With right arrow equals left parenthesis b comma negative a right parenthesis
→
AB= (b, −a) it depends on the absolute values StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue comma b|a|, b if this 
vector is a time-like vector, a space-like vector, or a null vector. 
So, the Minkowski–Pythagoras theorem asserts that “in a Minkowski right tri-
angle, the square of the Minkowski hypotenuse is the difference of the square of 
Minkowski legs.” 
The endpoints of unitary space-like vectors determine a Minkowski circle. The 
equation of this circle is x squared minus y squared equals negative 1x2 −y2 = −1. From the Euclidean point of view this is a 
hyperbola equation. 
The endpoints of unitary time-like vectors determine a Minkowski circle, too. The 
equation of this circle is x squared minus y squared equals 1x2 −y2 = 1. 
Exercise 2.3.2 What kind of triangle is determined by three arbitrary points of the 
Minkowski circle x squared minus y squared equals negative 1x2 −y2 = −1? 
The answer is: a pure time-like triangle, i.e. a triangle in which each side is a 
time-like vector pointing the future (or all three pointing the past). 
There are a lot of nice geometric properties for Minkowski circles, some of them 
similar to Euclidean properties. For our purpose the facts highlighted above are 
enough to continue. The Minkowski plane is denoted by upper M squaredM2.
Chapter 3 
From Projective Geometry to Poincaré 
Disk. How to Carry Out a Non-Euclidean 
Geometry Model 
Virtus unita fortior agit. 
This chapter is devoted to a ﬁrst model of Non-Euclidean Geometry. To construct 
this model, we need to deal with one of the most important transformations of the 
Euclidean plane, the geometric inversion. We still need some other acquirements, 
therefore we meet the Projective Geometry. An invariant described by a special 
projective map of a circle allows us to construct a non-Euclidean distance inside the 
disk. Elaborating the previous model we highlight the Poincaré disk model. 
3.1 Geometric Inversion and Its Properties 
The geometric inversion is a classical transformation of elementary Euclidean Plane 
Geometry. To describe it, let us consider a circle centred atupper OO and radiusupper RR, denoted 
upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesisC(O, R). 
A geometric inversion of centre upper O element of upper E squaredO ∈E2 and radius upper RR maps each point upper M element of upper E squared comma upper M not equals upper OM ∈
E2, M /= O to the point upper NN on the radius upper O upper MOM such that StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N EndAbsoluteValue equals upper R squared|OM| · |ON| = R2, where 
StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue|OM| is the Euclidean length between the points upper OO and upper MM. 
The circle upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesisC(O, R) is called circle of inversion. 
The points upper MM and upper NN are called homologous inverse points with respect to the 
previous geometric inversion determined by the circle of inversion upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesisC(O, R). upper R squaredR2 is 
called power of inversion. 
We prefer to use “inversion of centreupper O element of upper E squaredO ∈E2 and powerupper R squaredR2” instead of “inversion 
of centre upper O element of upper E squaredO ∈E2 and radius upper RR”. 
Suppose we know the homologous inverse upper MM and upper NN with respect to a geometric 
inversion havingupper OO as a centre andupper R squaredR2 as a power and the order of points on the radius

From Projective Geometry to Poincaré Disk …
upper O upper MOM is upper O comma upper M comma upper NO, M, N, or  upper O comma upper N comma upper MO, N, M, i.e. upper O not an element of left parenthesis upper M upper N right parenthesisO /∈(M N). This is a  direct inversion, when the 
oriented segments upper O upper MOM and upper O upper NON have the same direction. 
Now choose upper N primeN , the symmetric of upper NN with respect to upper OO, i.e. StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N prime EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N EndAbsoluteValue|ON ,| = |ON|. We  
have upper N primeN , on the radius upper O upper MOM, StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N prime EndAbsoluteValue equals upper R squared|OM| · |ON ,| = R2 and upper O element of left parenthesis upper M upper N prime right parenthesisO ∈(M N ,). 
Therefore, for the inverse upper NN of a point upper MM, with respect to a given inversion, we 
have two possibilities: 
(1) upper OO does not belong to the segment left parenthesis upper M upper N right parenthesis(M N), 
(2) upper OO belongs to the segment left parenthesis upper M upper N right parenthesis(M N). 
To conclude, when we are talking about an inversion and the inverse upper NN belongs to 
the radius upper O upper MOM, we have to specify if it is the direct geometric inversion i.e. we are 
talking about the map 
upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline colon upper E squared minus StartSet upper O EndSet right arrow upper E squared minus StartSet upper O EndSet comma upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals upper N comma upper O not an element of left parenthesis upper M upper N right parenthesis comma StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N EndAbsoluteValue equals upper R squared commaTO;R2 : E2 −{O} →E2 −{O}, TO;R2(M) = N, O /∈(M N), |OM| · |ON| = R2,
or we are talking about the map 
upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Superscript s Baseline colon upper E squared minus StartSet upper O EndSet right arrow upper E squared minus StartSet upper O EndSet comma upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Superscript s Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals upper N comma upper O element of left parenthesis upper M upper N right parenthesis comma StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N EndAbsoluteValue equals upper R squared commaT s
O;R2 : E2 −{O} →E2 −{O}, T s
O;R2(M) = N, O ∈(M N), |OM| · |ON| = R2,
which can be called symmetric geometric inversion. 
All next results are done for the direct geometric inversion, that is for the map 
upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squaredTO;R2. All the properties obtained can be easily transferred by symmetry with respect 
upper OO for the symmetric geometric inversion. When in a problem we use an inversion, 
the reader ﬁnds the information if it is a direct one or symmetric one looking at the 
map involved, i.e. upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squaredTO;R2 or upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Superscript sT s
O;R2. 
The main properties of the direct geometric inversion are: 
1. If upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals upper NTO;R2(M) = N, then upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper N right parenthesis equals upper MTO;R2(N) = M. 
In simple words, if upper NN is the inverse of upper MM, then upper MM is the inverse of upper NN. 
That is, 
upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis right parenthesis equals upper M periodTO;R2(TO;R2(M)) = M.
This property can be written in a simpler form as 
upper T squared equals i d Subscript upper E squared minus StartSet upper O EndSetT 2 = idE2−{O}
and it highlights that the geometric inversion is an idempotent transformation. 
2. upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesis right parenthesis equals upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesisTO;R2(C(O, R)) = C(O, R), that is the circle of inversion is invariant under 
the inversion it generates. 
3. A linedd which passes through the pole of inversion is invariant under inversion, 
i.e. 
upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis d minus StartSet upper O EndSet right parenthesis equals d minus StartSet upper O EndSet periodTO;R2(d −{O}) = d −{O}.

Before continuing, some notions are needed. A cyclic quadrilateral upper A upper B upper C upper DABC D is a 
quadrilateral which vertexesupper A comma upper B comma upper C comma upper DA, B, C, D belong to a circlenormal upper Gammal, called the circumcircle 
of the quadrilateral (Fig. 3.1). 
4. If upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper A right parenthesis equals upper BTO;R2(A) = B and upper T Subscript upper O semicolon upper R squared Baseline left parenthesis upper C right parenthesis equals upper DTO;R2(C) = D, then upper A upper B upper D upper CABDC is a cyclic quadrilateral. 
Hint: From StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper A EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper B EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper C EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper D EndAbsoluteValue equals upper R squared|O A| · |O B| = |OC| · |O D| = R2 it results StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper A EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper D EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper C EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper B EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction |O A|

|O B|. Then, 
triangleswhite up pointing triangle upper O upper A upper C△O AC andwhite up pointing triangle upper O upper D upper B△O DB are similar, i.e.angle upper O upper A upper C equals angle upper C upper D upper B∠O AC = ∠C DB, that is the quadri-
lateral upper A upper B upper D upper CABDC is a cyclic one. 
Why the circle of inversion is important? Because it allows us to construct the 
inverse of a point. 
5. Construction of the inverse of a given point. 
Suppose upper MM belongs to i n t upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesisintC(O, R) (Fig. 3.2). 
We consider the radiusupper O upper MOM and the perpendicular line toupper O upper MOM inupper MM which inter-
sects the circle at the pointsupper SS andupper S primeS,. Next,  we  refer toupper SS. The tangent atupper SS intersects 
the radius upper O upper MOM in upper NN. 
If we look at the right triangle white up pointing triangle upper O upper S upper N comma upper R squared equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper S EndAbsoluteValue squared equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N EndAbsoluteValue comma△OSN, R2 = |OS|2 = |OM| · |ON|, i.e. upper NN is 
the (direct) inverse of upper MM. 
Suppose upper MM is outside the circle of inversion (Fig. 3.3). 
We construct the radius upper O upper MOM and one of the tangent to the circle, upper M upper S comma upper S element of upper C left parenthesis upper O comma upper R right parenthesisMS, S ∈
C(O, R). The perpendicular fromupper SS toupper O upper MOM intersectsupper O upper MOM inupper NN. In the right triangle 
white up pointing triangle upper O upper S upper M△OSM we have upper R squared equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper S EndAbsoluteValue squared equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper N EndAbsoluteValueR2 = |OS|2 = |OM| · |ON|, i.e. upper NN is the inverse of upper MM. 
Let us observe that in the above two situations the circle passes through upper S upper M upper S prime upper NSMS,N

The pencils of lines allow us to better understand the points at inﬁnity of lines. As 
above, consider the linesd 1 comma d 2 comma d 3 comma d 4d1, d2, d3, d4 having the propertyStartSet upper O EndSet equals d 1 intersection d 2 intersection d 3 intersection d 4{O} = d1 ∩d2 ∩d3 ∩d4. 
Let dd be parallel to d 4d4 and StartSet upper A EndSet equals d intersection d 1 semicolon StartSet upper B EndSet equals d intersection d 2 semicolon StartSet upper C EndSet equals d intersection d 3{A} = d ∩d1; {B} = d ∩d2; {C} = d ∩d3 (Fig. 3.10). 
In this case we have to consider the point at inﬁnity to deﬁne left bracket d 1 d 2 semicolon d 3 d 4 right bracket[d1d2; d3d4]; 
left bracket d 1 d 2 semicolon d 3 d 4 right bracket equals left bracket upper A upper B semicolon upper C normal infinity right bracket equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper C upper A EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue upper C upper B EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction[d1d2; d3d4] = [AB; C∞] = |C A|
|C B|. If we consider another line, sayd primed,, such that 
d prime parallel to dd, || d and if we denote by StartSet upper A Superscript prime Baseline EndSet equals d prime intersection d 1 comma StartSet upper B Superscript prime Baseline EndSet equals d prime intersection d 2 comma StartSet upper C Superscript prime Baseline EndSet equals d intersection d 3{A,} = d, ∩d1, {B,} = d, ∩d2, {C,} = d ∩d3, then 
left bracket d 1 d 2 semicolon d 3 comma d 4 right bracket colon equals left bracket upper A prime upper B Superscript prime Baseline semicolon upper C normal infinity right bracket period[d1d2; d3, d4] := [A,B,; C∞]. The lines d comma d prime comma d 4d, d,, d4 have empty intersection in upper E squaredE2. 
This abstract point who doesn’t belong to the Euclidean plane, saynormal infinity∞, can be taught 
as the intersection of parallel lines d comma d primed, d, with d 4d4. 
We deﬁne for all parallel lines the same abstract point normal infinity∞. 
If, in a system of coordinates, all the parallel lines have the slope mm, we may  
think that this point at inﬁnity is attached to this slope. We can even denote this point 
by normal infinity Subscript m∞m. An interesting question can be asked: which geometrical structure will be 
assigned toStartSet normal infinity Subscript m Baseline comma m element of double struck upper R EndSet{∞m, m ∈R}? It can be taught as an abstract line? Or it is more intuitive 
to be taught as an abstract circle? Or it is something else? We see the answer a little 
bit later.

Pappus’ theorem shows that this deﬁnition is independent of the choice of upper MM. 
Here, it is important our observation related to the fact that the cross ratio of pencils 
depends on sine of angles. Since sine alpha equals sine left parenthesis pi minus alpha right parenthesissin α = sin(π −α), the point upper MM can be chosen 
even between two consecutive points, that is we can have, for a given sense on our 
circle, even the orderupper A comma upper B comma upper M comma upper C comma upper DA, B, M, C, D. The cross ratio is the same as for the order, say 
upper M comma upper A comma upper B comma upper C comma upper DM, A, B, C, D. 
Next theorem shows that the previous cross ratio left bracket upper A upper C semicolon upper B upper D right bracket Subscript normal upper Gamma[AC; BD]l can be transferred 
to the segment linesupper B upper A comma upper B upper C comma upper D upper A comma upper D upper CB A, BC, DA, DC determined by the four distinct points on the 
circle. We keep our notation generated by the order of points, now on the circle. To 
have a clear statement, for a chosen sense on our circle, let us consider the points 
upper M comma upper A comma upper B comma upper C comma upper DM, A, B, C, D in this order. Denote the angles of the pencil created by angle upper A upper M upper B equals alpha comma angle upper B upper M upper C equals beta comma angle upper C upper M upper D equals gamma∠AM B =

Consequences: The way the previous theorem was proved makes it to hold for 
projective maps: we can imagine between two circles, between a line and a circle, 
on the same line or on the same circle. 
This theorem can be easily extended to projective pencils: they are determined by 
three pairs of homologous rays. Generally speaking, a projective map is determined 
by the knowledge of three pairs of homologous points. 
If two projective maps f f and f 1 f1 has the same three pairs of homologous points, 
then f equals f 1 f = f1.

4. The example above may be extended. Consider two linesd 1d1 andd 2d2. The given 
constant angle intersects the lines such thatupper MM is ond 1d1 andupper NN is ond 2d2. Using Pappus’ 
theorem, upper M right arrow upper NM →N is a projective map between d 1d1 and d 2d2. 
For a projective map ondd, denote the coordinate ofupper MM byxx and the coordinate of

Deﬁnition 3.2.19 A projective map on dd which interchanges a pair of homologous 
points is called geometric involution, or simple, involution (Fig. 3.14). 
Theorem 3.2.20 All pairs of homologous points interchange in an involution. 
Proof Consider upper A right arrow upper B comma upper B right arrow upper A comma upper M right arrow upper NA →B, B →A, M →N and upper N right arrow upper XN →X. We wish to prove that 
upper X equals upper MX = M. Since left bracket upper A upper B semicolon upper M upper N right bracket equals left bracket upper B upper A semicolon upper N upper X right bracket[AB; M N] = [B A; N X] it results left bracket upper A upper B semicolon upper M upper N right bracket equals left bracket upper A upper B semicolon upper X upper N right bracket[AB; M N] = [AB; X N] i.e. 
upper X equals upper MX = M. white medium square

The same considerations hold for involutions of a circle. They have a pair of 
homologous points which can be interchanged. In fact all pairs of homologous points 
can be interchanged. Therefore upper M right arrow upper NM →N implies upper N right arrow upper MN →M, too.

Consider a set of arbitrary indexes denoted bydouble struck upper II,upper O 1 comma upper O 2 element of upper E squaredO1, O2 ∈E2. Also consider both

Deﬁnition 3.2.22 Two pencils of lines are projective if there exists a one to one map

called homologous rays.

left bracket upper A 1 upper A 2 semicolon upper A 3 upper A 4 right bracket equals left bracket upper B 1 upper B 2 semicolon upper B 3 upper B 4 right bracket[A1A2; A3 A4] = [B1B2; B3B4]. Therefore 
left bracket upper O upper A 1 upper O upper A 2 semicolon upper O upper A 3 upper O upper A 4 right bracket equals left bracket upper O upper B 1 upper O upper B 2 semicolon upper O upper B 3 upper O upper B 4 right bracket[O A1O A2; O A3O A4] = [O B1O B2;
O B3O B4]. It results that upper O left parenthesis upper O upper A right parenthesisO(O A) and upper O left parenthesis upper O f left parenthesis upper A right parenthesis right parenthesisO(O f (A)) are projective pencils of lines. 
Example 3.2.24 Consider a line dd and a projective map f colon d right arrow d f : d →d. Choose four 
arbitrary pointsupper A 1 comma upper A 2 comma upper A 3 comma upper A 4A1, A2, A3, A4 ondd and their images viaf f ,upper B 1 comma upper B 2 comma upper B 3 comma upper B 4B1, B2, B3, B4. We have

Therefore
left bracket upper O 1 upper A 1 upper O 1 upper A 2 semicolon upper O 1 upper A 3 upper O 1 upper A 4 right bracket equals left bracket upper O 2 upper B 1 upper O 2 upper B 2 semicolon upper O 2 upper B 3 upper O 2 upper B 4 right bracket[O1A1O1A2; O1A3O1A4] =
[O2B1O2B2; O2B3O2B4]. It results that upper O 1 left parenthesis upper O 1 upper A right parenthesisO1(O1A) and upper O 2 left parenthesis upper O 2 f left parenthesis upper A right parenthesis right parenthesisO2(O2 f (A)) are projective 
pencils of lines. 
Example 3.2.25 Consider the lines d comma d primed, d, and a projective mapf colon d right arrow d prime f : d →d,. Choose 
four arbitrary pointsupper A 1 comma upper A 2 comma upper A 3 comma upper A 4A1, A2, A3, A4 ondd and their images viaf f ,upper B 1 comma upper B 2 comma upper B 3 comma upper B 4B1, B2, B3, B4 ond primed,.

Problema 3.2.27 Considerupper MM andupper NN on the hypotenuseupper B upper CBC of an isosceles rectangle

Solution. Consider a system of coordinates such thatupper A left parenthesis 0 comma a right parenthesis comma upper B left parenthesis negative a comma 0 right parenthesis comma upper C left parenthesis a comma 0 right parenthesis commaA(0, a), B(−a, 0), C(a, 0),
upper M left parenthesis x comma 0 right parenthesis comma upper N left parenthesis y comma 0 right parenthesisM(x, 0), N(y, 0). upper M upper N squared equals upper B upper M squared plus upper C upper N squaredM N 2 = BM2 + C N 2 can be written in the form 
left parenthesis x plus a right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis a minus y right parenthesis squared equals left parenthesis y minus x right parenthesis squared comma(x + a)2 + (a −y)2 = (y −x)2,
that is y equals StartFraction a x plus a squared Over negative x plus a EndFractiony = ax + a2
−x + a . This is a projective map on upper B upper CBC. 
Since x equals negative ax = −a implies y equals 0y = 0, it results upper B right arrow upper OB →O. x equals 0x = 0 implies y equals ay = a, therefore 
upper O right arrow upper CO →C. For x equals ax = a it results y equals normal infinityy = ∞, i.e. upper C right arrow normal infinity periodC →∞.
So, this projective map on upper B upper CBC is determined by upper B right arrow upper O comma upper O right arrow upper C comma upper C right arrow normal infinityB →O, O →C, C →∞. 
If we consider a rotating angleangle upper M upper A upper N equals StartFraction pi Over 4 EndFraction∠M AN = π
4 we observe three important positions 
upper M equals upper B comma upper N equals upper O semicolon upper M equals upper O comma upper N equals upper C semicolon upper M equals upper C comma upper N equals normal infinityM = B, N = O; M = O, N = C; M = C, N = ∞
such that angle upper B upper A upper O equals angle upper O upper A upper C equals angle upper C upper O normal infinity equals StartFraction pi Over 4 EndFraction period∠B AO = ∠O AC = ∠CO∞= π
4 . Therefore the rotating angle leads 
to a projective map on upper B upper CBC determined by upper B right arrow upper O comma upper O right arrow upper C comma upper C right arrow normal infinityB →O, O →C, C →∞. The  two  
projective maps are coincident, therefore always angle upper M upper A upper N equals StartFraction pi Over 4 EndFraction∠M AN = π

We know that upper M right arrow upper NM →N is a projective map between the lines upper I upper DI D and upper I upper E periodI E. It 
results a projective map between the pencils upper A left parenthesis upper A upper M right parenthesisA(AM) and upper B left parenthesis upper B upper N right parenthesisB(BN). The intersection 
point between upper A upper MAM and upper B upper NBN lies on a conic. A conic is determined by the knowl-
edge of ﬁve distinct points of it. The initial moment upper M equals upper N equals upper IM = N = I implies that upper II
belongs to the conic. When upper M equals upper DM = D it results upper N equals upper EN = E, therefore Gergonne’s point 
of the triangle ABC, upper G Subscript eGe, belongs to the conic. Now consider upper M comma upper NM, N moving from 
upper II to upper D 1 comma upper E 1D1, E1 respectively. Since the triangles upper I upper E upper D 1I E D1 and upper I upper E upper D 1I E D1 are congruent, when 
upper M equals upper D 1M = D1 it resultsupper N equals upper E 1N = E1, thereforeupper A upper M intersection upper B upper N equals StartSet upper C EndSetAM ∩BN = {C}. According to Steiner’s the-
orem the conic contains upper AA and upper BB. But it is easy to observe for this projective map 
why. When upper M equals upper D 2M = D2, upper A upper D 2 intersection upper B upper N equals StartSet upper B EndSetAD2 ∩BN = {B}, and when upper N equals upper E 2N = E2, upper A upper M intersection upper B upper E 2 equals StartSet upper A EndSet periodAM ∩BE2 = {A}.
Therefore Steiner conic for the projective pencilsupper A left parenthesis upper A upper M right parenthesis comma upper B left parenthesis upper B upper N right parenthesisA(AM), B(BN) is determined by 
upper A comma upper B comma upper C comma upper I comma upper G Subscript e BaselineA, B, C, I, Ge. The same for the Steiner conics determined by the projective pencils 
upper A left parenthesis upper A upper M right parenthesis comma upper C left parenthesis upper C upper P right parenthesisA(AM), C(C P) and upper B left parenthesis upper B upper N right parenthesis comma upper C left parenthesis upper C upper P right parenthesis periodB(BN), C(C P). Therefore the three Steiner conics are coin-
cident, i.e.upper A upper M intersection upper B upper N intersection upper C upper P not equals normal empty setAM ∩BN ∩C P /= ∅whenStartAbsoluteValue upper I upper M EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper I upper N EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper I upper P EndAbsoluteValue|I M| = |I N| = |I P|. In the particular case 
of the statement, a particular point belongs to Steiner’s conic. We are talking about 
Karya’s point. If we choose the points at inﬁnity ofupper A upper M comma upper B upper N comma upper C upper PAM, BN, C P we can see that the 
orthocenter upper HH belongs to the Steiner conic. As you can see, this projective solution 
allows us to highlight many other points of intersection among upper A upper M comma upper B upper NAM, BN and upper C upper PC P
described by the condition StartAbsoluteValue upper I upper M EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper I upper N EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper I upper P EndAbsoluteValue|I M| = |I N| = |I P|. white medium square

called perspective pencils if the ray upper O 1 upper O 2O1O2 is self-homologous, i.e. upper O 1 upper O 2 right arrow upper O 1 upper O 2O1O2 →O1O2. 
Theorem 3.2.30 If upper O 1 left parenthesis alpha right parenthesisO1(α) and upper O 2 left parenthesis beta right parenthesis comma upper O 1 not equals upper O 2O2(β), O1 /= O2 are perspective pencils, then the

Let us answer to the question: which is the geometrical structure ofStartSet normal infinity Subscript m Baseline comma m element of double struck upper R EndSet{∞m, m ∈R}? 
First, it is easy to see that for a given lined subset of upper E squaredd ⊂E2 it exist two perspective pencils of 
lines,upper O 1 left parenthesis alpha right parenthesisO1(α) andupper O 2 left parenthesis beta right parenthesisO2(β), such thatdd is the perspective axis of the previous perspective 
pencils. If we have two perspective pencils there is one case in which the perspective 
axis doesn’t exist: when the homologous rays of the perspective pencils are parallel. 
Exactly as in the case of the abstract inﬁnity point of a line added to preserve a 
geometric rule, we do the same thing. In the case of parallel perspective pencils the 
perspective axis is an abstract line, called the line at inﬁnity ofupper E squaredE2. Therefore we may 
denote d Subscript normal infinity Baseline colon equals StartSet normal infinity Subscript m Baseline comma m element of double struck upper R EndSetd∞:= {∞m, m ∈R}. 
Perspective pencils allow us to construct a special line assigned to any projective 
map f f on a circle: the axis of f f . This line plays a crucial role in the construction of 
Poincaré disk model. 
Consider for a projective mapf f onacirclenormal upper Gammal the homologous pointsupper M comma upper M prime comma upper M right arrow upper M primeM, M,, M →

It is obvious to observe that 
gg is an involution of normal upper Gammal. 
Theorem 3.2.31 (i) The map f degrees g Subscript upper P Baseline colon normal upper Gamma right arrow normal upper Gamma f ◦gP : l →l is an involution of normal upper Gammal. 
(ii) The locus of points upper I Subscript f Baseline element of upper E squaredI f ∈E2 such that f degrees g Subscript upper I Sub Subscript f f ◦gI f is an involution of normal upper Gammal is a line. 
Proof (i) f f and g Subscript upper PgP are projective maps on normal upper Gammal, then f degrees g Subscript upper P f ◦gP is a projective map on normal upper Gammal. 
It remains to prove thatf degrees g Subscript upper P f ◦gP has a pair of homologous points which interchanges. 
We show that f degrees g Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis upper A prime right parenthesis equals upper B prime f ◦gP(A,) = B, and f degrees g Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis upper B prime right parenthesis equals upper A prime f ◦gP(B,) = A,. Let’s compute f degrees g Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis upper A prime right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis g Subscript upper P Baseline left parenthesis upper A prime right parenthesis right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis upper B right parenthesis equals upper B prime f ◦gP(A,) =

therefore f degrees g Subscript upper P f ◦gP is an involution of normal upper Gammal. 
(ii) Considerupper A right arrow upper A primeA →A, a given pair of homologous point off f andupper M right arrow upper M primeM →M, the gen-

from the general pair by replacing upper MM by upper AA. The pencils upper A left parenthesis upper A upper M prime right parenthesisA(AM,) and upper A prime left parenthesis upper A prime upper M right parenthesisA,(A,M) are 
perspective, the self-homologous ray beingupper A upper A primeAA,. The homologous rays intersection, 
i.e. StartSet upper I Subscript f Baseline EndSet equals upper A upper M Superscript prime Baseline intersection upper A prime upper M{I f } = AM, ∩A,M, lies on the perspective axis, therefore the locus is a line.white medium square ▢

(iii) (iv) and (v) are obvious. 
(vi) Consider the projective map on upper I upper JI J determined by particular positions of upper XX

Since the angles involved 
are equal it results 
left bracket upper M s upper M upper S semicolon upper M upper J upper M upper Y right bracket equals left bracket upper N s upper N upper S semicolon upper N upper I upper N upper X right bracket comma[MsMS; M J MY] = [NsN S; N I N X],
i.e. left bracket s upper S upper I upper X right bracket equals left bracket s upper S upper J upper Y right bracket[sSI X] = [sSJY]. 
(vii) From left bracket s upper S upper I upper X right bracket equals left bracket s upper S upper J upper Y right bracket[sSI X] = [sSJY] it results left bracket upper S s upper I upper X right bracket equals left bracket upper S s upper J upper Y right bracket[SsI X] = [Ss JY]. If you write the last

Before continuing, let us conclude in the following way. 
For upper II and upper JJ belonging to the interior of our circle, we construct the projec-
tivity of the circle f colon equals upper I degrees upper J f := I ◦J determined by the product of the given interior 
involutions. Supposeupper M right arrow upper NM →N in this projectivity. For eachupper X element of upper I upper JX ∈I J, we construct 
upper Y element of upper I upper JY ∈I J as in the previous theorem. The projectivityupper X right arrow upper YX →Y onupper I upper JI J is determined 
by f f . It is called the axial decomposition of the projectivity f f (of the circle) on 
the line upper I upper JI J. This was the most important step towards the construction of a 
non-Euclidean distance in the interior of the circle. 
The next steps are the Theorems 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 in the next section. 
Let us observe: Consider upper S comma upper S prime element of normal upper GammaS, S, ∈l such that the chord upper S upper S primeSS, is not a diameter; 
Then, the tangents at upper S comma upper S primeS, S, meet at the centre of an orthogonal circle to normal upper Gammal. 
If upper A element of i n t normal upper GammaA ∈intl and upper S element of normal upper GammaS ∈l, we know that the orthogonal circle to normal upper Gammal passing through 
upper AA andupper SS is constructed in the following way: the tangent atupper SS meet the perpendicular 
bisector of the segment upper A upper SAS at the centre of the orthogonal circle.

Ifupper A comma upper B element of i n t normal upper GammaA, B ∈intl the orthogonal circle tonormal upper Gammal passing throughupper AA andupper BB is constructed 
in the following way: we constructupper A primeA,, the  inverse ofupper AA in the direct inversionupper T Subscript upper O comma upper R squaredTO,R2, 
whereupper O comma upper RO, R are the centre, respectively the radius ofnormal upper Gammal. The perpendicular bisectors 
of the triangle upper A upper B upper A primeAB A, meet at the centre of the orthogonal circle we are looking for. 
Observe that upper B primeB,, the  inverse of upper BB in the same inversion belongs to this circle. 
Another more important observation is: 
Proposition 3.2.33 Ifupper A comma upper B comma upper C comma upper D element of normal upper GammaA, B, C, D ∈l such thatStartSet upper L EndSet equals upper A upper B intersection upper C upper D comma upper L element of i n t normal upper Gamma{L} = AB ∩C D, L ∈intl, then 
the orthogonal circles determined by the chords upper A upper B comma upper C upper DAB, C D denoted by gamma Subscript upper A upper B Baseline comma gamma Subscript upper C upper D BaselineγAB, γC D
respectively, meet in upper X comma upper X primeX, X, such that upper O comma upper X comma upper L comma upper X primeO, X, L, X, are collinear. 
Proof upper OO and upper LL have equal powers with respect gamma Subscript upper A upper B Baseline comma gamma Subscript upper C upper D BaselineγAB, γC D. 
The powers are upper R squaredR2 for upper OO, u colon equals StartAbsoluteValue upper L upper A EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper L upper B EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper L upper C EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper L upper D EndAbsoluteValueu := |L A| · |L B| = |LC| · |L D| for upper LL respectively, 
therefore they belong to the radical axis of the two circles. But the radical axis passes 
through the points of intersection of the two orthogonal circles, i.e. upper O comma upper X comma upper L comma upper X primeO, X, L, X, are 
collinear. Extra, StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper X EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper X prime EndAbsoluteValue equals upper R squared|O X| · |O X,| = R2, that is upper XX and upper X primeX, are inverse in upper T Subscript upper O comma upper R squaredTO,R2.white medium square

3.3 Poincaré Disk Model 
We underline some results proved above, results which are necessary to introduce 
the Poincaré disk model. If upper I comma upper J element of i n t normal upper GammaI, J ∈intl, f colon equals upper I degrees upper J f := I ◦J is a projective map on normal upper Gammal such 
that upper I upper JI J is its axis. 
If upper X right arrow upper YX →Y are the homologous points in the axial decomposition of f f on 
a colon equals upper I upper Ja := I J, andStartSet s comma upper S EndSet equals a intersection normal upper Gamma{s, S} = a ∩l such that the order iss comma upper I comma upper J comma upper Ss, I, J, S;s comma upper X comma upper Y comma upper Ss, X, Y, S respectively, 
then left bracket upper I upper J upper S s right bracket equals left bracket upper X upper Y upper S s right bracket equals k greater than 1 period[I J Ss] = [XY Ss] = k > 1. Therefore left bracket upper S s upper I upper J right bracket equals k[SsI J] = k is an invariant of the axial 
decomposition of f f . In fact kk depends on upper II and upper JJ, that is k equals k Subscript upper I upper Jk = kI J is an invariant 
attached to the involutions upper II and upper JJ on the axis of the projective map f equals upper I degrees upper J f = I ◦J. 
If we consider the orthogonal circle to normal upper Gammal through ss and upper SS, denoted gg, on the arc 
g colon equals g Subscript s upper Sg := gsS from the i n t normal upper Gammaintl we can consider two special points upper I prime comma upper J prime comma StartSet upper I Superscript prime Baseline EndSet colon equals upper O upper I intersection g Subscript s upper S Baseline comma StartSet upper J Superscript prime Baseline EndSet colon equals upper O upper J intersection g Subscript s upper S Baseline periodI ,, J ,, {I ,} := OI ∩
gsS, {J ,} := O J ∩gsS.
A very important result will be proved: 
left bracket upper I upper J upper S s right bracket equals left bracket upper I prime upper J prime upper S s right bracket Subscript g Superscript 2 Baseline period[I J Ss] = [I ,J ,Ss]2
g.
Let us describe again the context. Consider the circlenormal upper Gammal centred atupper OO andi n t normal upper Gammaintl the 
disk enclosed by normal upper Gammal. Let upper II and upper JJ be in i n t normal upper Gammaintl and denote by ss and upper SS the intersections 
of the lineupper I upper JI J withnormal upper Gamma periodl. Suppose the order iss comma upper I comma upper J comma upper S periods, I, J, S. Denote bygg the orthogonal arc 
tonormal upper Gammal passing throughss andupper SS, and letupper I primeI , andupper J primeJ , be the intersections ofgg withupper O upper IOI and 
upper O upper JO J, respectively (Fig. 3.16). 
We have to consider the direct inversion of pole upper SS and power mu equals left parenthesis s upper S right parenthesis squared periodμ = (sS)2.
The point ss is ﬁxed by this transformation. The circle normal upper Gammal, which passes through 
the pole of inversion, is transformed into the line i left parenthesis normal upper Gamma right parenthesisi(l) which passes through ss. The  
arcgg is transformed into the linei left parenthesis g right parenthesisi(g), andi left parenthesis g right parenthesis up tack i left parenthesis normal upper Gamma right parenthesis periodi(g)⊥i(l). Letd 1 colon equals upper O upper Id1 := OI andd 2 colon equals upper O upper J periodd2 := O J.

The line d 1d1, which doesn’t pass through the pole of inversion, is transformed into 
the circle c 1c1 passing through upper SS. Furthermore, c 1c1 contains the images of upper I primeI , and upper II, 
denoted by upper G 1G1 and upper J 1J1, respectively. In fact, since d 1 up tack normal upper Gamma commad1 ⊥l, then c 1c1 and i left parenthesis normal upper Gamma right parenthesisi(l) must 
also be orthogonal, which means that c 1c1 has the line i left parenthesis normal upper Gamma right parenthesisi(l) as a diameter. A similar 
reasoning can be done for the line d 2 periodd2.
We introduce the following notations: StartSet upper G 1 comma upper G prime 1 EndSet equals c 1 intersection i left parenthesis g right parenthesis comma{G1, G,
1} = c1 ∩i(g), and StartSet upper G 2 comma upper G prime 2 EndSet equals c 2 intersection i left parenthesis g right parenthesis period{G2, G,
2} =
c2 ∩i(g).
Finally, we remark that upper SS is mapped by this inversion into normal infinity∞. 
Then we have the following: 
left bracket upper I upper J upper S s right bracket equals left bracket upper J 1 upper J 2 normal infinity s right bracket equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue s upper J 2 EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue s upper J 1 EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction comma[I J Ss] = [J1J2∞s] = |s J2|
|s J1|,

|sG1|.
The power of the point ss with respect to c 1c1 yields: 
StartAbsoluteValue upper S s EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue s upper J 1 EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue s upper G 1 EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue s upper G prime 1 EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue s upper G 1 EndAbsoluteValue squared period|Ss| · |s J1| = |sG1| · |sG,
1| = |sG1|2.
Similarly, the power of ss with respect to c 2c2 yields: 
StartAbsoluteValue upper S s EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue s upper J 2 EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue s upper G 2 EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue s upper G prime 2 EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue s upper G 2 EndAbsoluteValue squared period|Ss| · |s J2| = |sG2| · |sG,
2| = |sG2|2.
Therefore, we have 
StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue s upper J 1 EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue s upper J 2 EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction equals left parenthesis StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue s upper G 1 EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue s upper G 2 EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction right parenthesis squared period|s J1|

This result actually means we proved the following

Theorem 3.3.1 left bracket upper I upper J upper S s right bracket equals left bracket upper I prime upper J prime upper S s right bracket Subscript g Superscript 2 Baseline period[I J Ss] = [I ,J ,Ss]2

It results that the points upper I comma upper J element of aI, J ∈a generate upper I prime comma upper J prime element of g Subscript s upper S BaselineI ,, J , ∈gsS such that the invariant

g and left bracket upper I upper J upper S s right bracket equals left bracket upper I prime upper J prime upper S s right bracket Subscript g Superscript 2 Baseline period[I J Ss] = [I ,J ,Ss]2
g.
Therefore we move points and invariants from the axis of a projective map of a 
circle normal upper Gammal to an orthogonal arc gg to normal upper Gammal. 
On the initial conﬁguration, we apply a symmetric inversion of poleupper J primeJ , and power 
mu prime commaμ,, where mu primeμ, is the power of upper J primeJ , with respect to the circle normal upper Gamma periodl.
Consequently, the circle normal upper Gammal is mapped into normal upper Gammal itself by this transformation. 
The arc gg becomes the line i left parenthesis g right parenthesis commai(g), which is a diameter in normal upper Gamma periodl.
The pointupper I primeI , is transformed intoupper F prime 1 commaF,

The pole upper J primeJ , is mapped into normal infinity period∞.
The point upper P element of normal upper GammaP ∈l is transformed into upper P prime element of normal upper Gamma commaP, ∈l, such that StartAbsoluteValue upper J prime upper P EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue upper J prime upper P prime EndAbsoluteValue equals mu prime|J ,P| · |J ,P,| = μ, and 
upper P primeP, is the second intersection of normal upper Gammal with the line upper J prime upper P periodJ ,P.
Denote i left parenthesis s right parenthesisi(s) and i left parenthesis upper S right parenthesisi(S) the images of ss and upper SS through the previously described 
inversion. We have 
left bracket upper I prime upper J prime upper S s right bracket Subscript g Baseline equals left bracket upper F prime 1 normal infinity i left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis i left parenthesis s right parenthesis right bracket equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue i left parenthesis upper S right parenthesis upper F prime 1 EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue i left parenthesis s right parenthesis upper F prime 1 EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction equals StartFraction max Underscript upper P prime element of normal upper Gamma Endscripts StartAbsoluteValue upper P prime upper F prime 1 EndAbsoluteValue Over min Underscript upper P prime element of normal upper Gamma Endscripts StartAbsoluteValue upper P prime upper F prime 1 EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction period[I ,J ,Ss]g = [F,

Furthermore,

Let see how these algebraic invariants generate distances in the interior of normal upper Gammal.

The previously proven facts allow us to assert 
Theorem 3.3.3 d Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis upper I comma upper J right parenthesis equals d Subscript g Baseline left parenthesis upper I prime comma upper J Superscript prime Baseline right parenthesis equals d left parenthesis upper I prime comma upper J prime right parenthesisda(I, J) = dg(I ,, J ,) = d(I ,, J ,). 
After Deﬁnition 3.3.4 we will prove that all three formulas are distances for the 
interior of the circle normal upper Gammal. Having this in mind, let us say that the ﬁrst distance, d Subscript ada is 
related to the Cayley-Klein model of a Non-Euclidean geometry. It is easy to see that 
if we choose a pointupper KK onupper I upper JI J line such that the order of points isupper I comma upper J comma upper KI, J, K, we obtain 
the following equality related to the Cayley-Klein distance, 
d Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis upper I comma upper K right parenthesis equals d Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis upper I comma upper J right parenthesis plus d Subscript a Baseline left parenthesis upper J comma upper K right parenthesis periodda(I, K) = da(I, J) + da(J, K).
Therefore the chord upper I upper JI J becomes a line of this geometry. It is obvious that from a 
point upper LL which doesn’t belong to the line upper I upper JI J, one can construct at least two chords, 
that is two lines of this distance, passing through upper LL which do not intersect upper I upper JI J. This  
is the ﬁrst model of Non-Euclidean geometry. A Differential Geometry treatment 
of this model can be seen later when we discuss the hyperboloid models of the 
Non-Euclidean geometry. 
The second and the third distances are related to the Poincaré model. 
Consider two arbitrary sets upper KK and upper U periodU.

of the asked maximum. The reader will see this in the cases of the “semi-plane” and 
“exterior of the disk” models for Non-Euclidean Geometry. 
All these beautiful geometric facts were possible because of the axial projective 
map derived from a projective map of a circle.

We can observe that whenupper J right arrow upper S comma i period e period x right arrow 1J →S, i.e. x →1 thend left parenthesis upper I comma upper J right parenthesis right arrow normal infinityd(I, J) →∞. The disk becomes 
unbounded with respect to this distance. 
What kind of Geometry do we have inside the disk? Next, we prove that it is a 
Non-Euclidean one. We can expect at this result taking into account the Cayley–Klein 
model presented above. 
A pointupper I element of i n t normal upper GammaI ∈intl is called an n-point in our Geometry. The points of the circlenormal upper Gammal
are called normal infinity∞-points. 
An orthogonal arc of a circle to normal upper Gammal is called an n-line. Such an n-line is uniquely 
determined by two n-points, by twonormal infinity∞-points, or by annormal infinity∞-point and an n-point. Two 
n-lines intersect at most at an n-point. Three n-points are called n-collinear if they 
belong to an n-line. 
It is easy to show that there exist non-intersecting n-lines. If two chords upper S sSs and 
upper S prime s primeS,s, do not intersect in the interior of the disk, then the orthogonal to normal upper Gammal arcs of 
circles having the same endpoints are n-lines with empty intersection, that is non-
intersecting n-lines. Through an n-point which doesn’t belong to a given n-line we 
can construct at least two non-intersecting n-lines with respect to the given n-line. 
In fact, if the given n-line is the orthogonal arcgamma Subscript s upper SγsS andupper I not an element of gamma Subscript s upper SI /∈γsS, among the inﬁnitely 
many non-intersecting n-lines there exist two special ones,gamma Subscript s upper I Baseline comma gamma Subscript upper S upper I BaselineγsI, γSI which are called 
n-parallels to gamma Subscript s upper SγsS. 
The angle between two n-lines is, by deﬁnition, the Euclidean angle between the 
tangents to the arcs at the common point. 
An n-triangle is determined by three non-n-collinear points. The sides of an n-
triangle are n-lines. 
What about the sum of the angles in an n-triangle? 
According to the theory described in the previous chapter, it is enough to study 
what happens in the case of one given triangle. We can choose a triangle with one 
vertex at the centreupper OO ofnormal upper Gammal and two other n-points,upper AA andupper BB. Consider the Euclidean 
triangle upper A upper O upper BAO B. The sum of the angles of the Euclidean triangle is piπ. The angle at 
upper OO, i.e. upper A upper O upper BAO B is common to both triangles, but each other n-angle is less than the 
corresponding Euclidean angle. Therefore, the sum of the angles of the n-triangle is 
less than piπ. 
More about this model of Non-Euclidean Geometry and some other models con-
nected to this one can be understood only after we study Differential Geometry.

Revisiting the Differential Geometry 
of Surfaces in 3D-Spaces 
If you want to understand the inﬁnity you ﬁrst feel the taste of 
stars
... 
The physicist in preparing for his work needs three things: 
Mathematics, mathematics, and mathematics. 
Wilhelm Röntgen 
We intend to present some basic facts related to the Differential Geometry of a surface 
in a3 upper D3D-space in the simplest form we imagined. All readers must know basic Calculus 
and they have to accept from the beginning that we work with functions which are 
smooth, that is they are indeﬁnitely differentiable functions in one or several variables 
at each point of their domain of deﬁnition. 
The3 upper D3D-spaces in which we are looking at surfaces are endowed with Euclidean or 
Minkowski-type metrics induced by quadratic forms attached to bilinear products. 
We have to remember how the “objects” revealed by the application of Calculus 
in Geometry offer the new landscape that allows us to correctly understand the 
foundations of Geometry and to step to Relativity. Simple computations highlight 
all we need to know about the geometry of surfaces. The change of coordinates 
preserves the results described by theorems and preserves the nature of geometric 
“objects” we refer, changing only the space of the geometry studied. Looking at 
all these surfaces, we intend to obtain models for Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and 
Elliptic geometries. This is possible because, in our journey through the Differential 
Geometry of surfaces, we will understand the crucial role of Theorema Egregium by 
Gauss. 
This is the approach when the ambient space of the set in which we intend to 
create a geometry becomes unnecessary. Only the set of coordinates, together with 
a metric, are necessary to describe the geometry. This point of view is continued in 
the next short chapter dedicated to basic Differential Geometry. The two chapters

ﬁrst edition of this book, A Mathematical Journey to Relativity (see [ 34]). 
4.1 
Basic Notations and Deﬁnitions of the Geometry 
of Surfaces 
The complexity of formulas in Differential Geometry needs some simpliﬁcations. 
Therefore, before starting with the deﬁnitions, we introduce ﬁrst some necessary 
notations: 
• a Subscript i Baseline b Superscript iaibi meanssigma summation Underscript i equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts a Subscript i Baseline b Superscript i
nE
i=1
aibi. This is the  Einstein summation convention, or simply  Einstein 
notation. 
• The index ii from the previous formula is called a dummy index because we can 
replace it by some other letter, say ss, without changing the meaning. That is a Subscript s Baseline b Superscript sasbs
means sigma summation Underscript s equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts a Subscript s Baseline b Superscript s
nE
s=1
asbs. 
• It can be extended for double or triple sums, that is a Subscript i j Baseline x Superscript i Baseline y Superscript j Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript i comma j equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts a Subscript i j Baseline x Superscript i Baseline y Superscript jai jxi y j =
nE
i, j=1

a Subscript i j k Baseline x Superscript i Baseline y Superscript j Baseline z Superscript k Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript i comma j comma k equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts a Subscript i j k Baseline x Superscript i Baseline y Superscript j Baseline z Superscript kai jkxi y jzk =
nE
i, j,k=1
ai jkxi y jzk. One can adopt this convention for multiple sums, 
the sums being thought before the indexes up and down or down and up denoted 
by the same letter. 
If below one reads something like normal upper Gamma Subscript s j Superscript i Baseline normal upper Gamma Subscript k l Superscript sTi

• The number nn is related to the dimension of the set endowed with a coordinate 
system, set in which we develop Differential Geometry concepts. In the case of 
surfaces, n equals 2n = 2. 
• The Euclidean three-dimensional space, denoted by upper E cubedE3, can be thought as the 
vector space double struck upper R cubedR3 over the ﬁeld double struck upper RR endowed with the Euclidean inner product 
left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket colon equals a 0 b 0 plus a 1 b 1 plus a 2 b 2 comma <a, b> := a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2,
where a equals left parenthesis a 0 comma a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesis comma b equals left parenthesis b 0 comma b 1 comma b 2 right parenthesisa = (a0, a1, a2), b = (b0, b1, b2). Often we refer to this space as the 
Euclidean 3D space. 
• In a frame generated by the unit vectors ModifyingAbove i With right arrow equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove j With right arrow equals left parenthesis 0 comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesis

i = (1, 0, 0),
→
j = (0, 1, 0) and ModifyingAbove k With right arrow equals left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 1 right parenthesis
→
k =
(0, 0, 1), the components of a vector ModifyingAbove a With right arrow
→a with respect to this basis become coor-
dinates in the new frame, that is, we can assign them to a point upper AA. We can write 
upper A left parenthesis a 0 comma a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesisA(a0, a1, a2) and this point can be seen as the endpoint of the vector ModifyingAbove a With right arrow
→a whose 
origin is in the point left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0, 0). To simplify, we often write directly aa to denote the 
vector ModifyingAbove a With right arrow
→a .
4.1 Basic Notations and Deﬁnitions of the Geometry of Surfaces

• Euclidean perpendicular vectors correspond to null inner product, i.e.aa andbb are 
perpendicular (or orthogonal) if left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket equals 0<a, b> = 0. With respect to the Euclidean inner 
product, the previous basis is an orthogonal one. 
• The length of the vector aa is, by deﬁnition, StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue colon equals StartRoot left angle bracket a comma a right angle bracket EndRoot equals StartRoot a 0 squared plus a 1 squared plus a 2 squared EndRoot||a|| := √<a, a> =

• The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for the triples left parenthesis a 0 comma a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesis comma left parenthesis b 0 comma b 1 comma b 2 right parenthesis(a0, a1, a2), (b0, b1, b2) is 
left parenthesis a 0 b 0 plus a 1 b 1 plus a 2 b 2 right parenthesis squared less than or equals left parenthesis a 0 squared plus a 1 squared plus a 2 squared right parenthesis left parenthesis b 0 squared plus b 1 squared plus b 2 squared right parenthesis comma(a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2)2 ≤(a2
0 + a2
1 + a2

that is, for vectors, the inequality can be written in terms of inner product and 
norm in the form left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket squared less than or equals StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue squared dot StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue squared<a, b>2 ≤||a||2 · ||b||2. The equality happens when the triples 
are proportional: this fact corresponds to collinear vectors. 
• If two vectors aa and bb are not collinear, they determine a plane. 
In this plane it makes sense to deﬁne the angle alphaα between the non-zero vectors aa
and bb by the formula 
cosine alpha colon equals StartFraction left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket Over StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction period cos α :=
<a, b>
||a|| · ||b||.
Written in the form 
left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket equals StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue cosine alpha <a, b> = ||a|| · ||b|| cos α
this formula is known as Pythagoras generalized theorem for the triangle upper O upper A upper BO AB
determined by the vectors aa and bb. 
• The Euclidean distance between two points upper A left parenthesis a 0 comma a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesis comma upper B left parenthesis b 0 comma b 1 comma b 2 right parenthesisA(a0, a1, a2), B(b0, b1, b2) is given 
by the formula 
d left parenthesis upper A comma upper B right parenthesis colon equals StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a minus b EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue equals StartRoot left angle bracket a minus b comma a minus b right angle bracket EndRoot equals StartRoot left parenthesis a 0 minus b 0 right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis a 1 minus b 1 right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis a 2 minus b 2 right parenthesis squared EndRootd(A, B) := ||a −b|| =
/
<a −b, a −b> =
/
(a0 −b0)2 + (a1 −b1)2 + (a2 −b2)2
The length of a vector aa becomes the distance between the origin upper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0, 0) and 
the point upper A left parenthesis a 0 comma a 1 comma a 2 right parenthesisA(a0, a1, a2). The Euclidean distance is denoted by StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue upper O upper A StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue||O A|| or by StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper A EndAbsoluteValue|O A|. 
We prefer this last notation and we keep in mind that StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue upper A upper B StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue upper A upper B EndAbsoluteValue||AB|| = |AB|. Looking 
again to the Pythagoras generalized theorem, according to the new notations, we 
have 
StartAbsoluteValue upper A upper B EndAbsoluteValue squared equals StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper A EndAbsoluteValue squared plus StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper B EndAbsoluteValue squared plus 2 StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper A EndAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper B EndAbsoluteValue cosine alpha period|AB|2 = |O A|2 + |O B|2 + 2|O A||O B| cos α.
• The crossproduct of two vectors is the vector given by the formula 
a times b equals left parenthesis a 1 b 2 minus a 2 b 1 comma minus a 0 b 2 plus a 2 b 0 comma a 0 b 1 minus a 1 b 0 right parenthesis perioda × b = (a1b2 −a2b1, −a0b2 + a2b0, a0b1 −a1b0).

Revisiting the Differential Geometry …
Since left angle bracket a times b comma a right angle bracket equals 0<a × b, a> = 0 and left angle bracket a times b comma b right angle bracket equals 0<a × b, b> = 0 the vector a times ba × b is orthogonal to the plane 
determined by the vectors aa and bb. The following formula holds, StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a times b EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue equals StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue a EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue dot sine alpha||a × b|| = ||a|| ·
||b|| · sin α.

Surfaces, Tangent Planes and Gauss Frames 
After these preliminaries, we can deﬁne a surface. The algebraic point of view is 
related to equations.upper X squared plus upper Y squared plus upper Z squared equals 1X2 + Y 2 + Z2 = 1 is the algebraic deﬁnition of a sphere centred 
at the origin with radius 11. Or 2 upper X plus 3 upper Y minus upper Z equals 62X + 3Y −Z = 6 is the equation of a plane, etc. 
In Differential Geometry, we deal with smooth functions describing a surface. 
The previous sphere can be seen as the smooth function f colon left parenthesis 0 comma pi right parenthesis times left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesis right arrow upper E cubed f : (0, π) × (0, 2π) →
E3, 
f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis comma x Superscript 1 Baseline element of left parenthesis 0 comma pi right parenthesis comma x squared element of left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesis period f (x1, x2) = (sin x1 cos x2, sin x1 sin x2, cos x1), x1 ∈(0, π), x2 ∈(0, 2π).
Or, the previous plane can be seen as the smooth function f colon double struck upper R times double struck upper R right arrow upper E cubed f : R × R →E3, 
f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma 2 x Superscript 1 Baseline plus 3 x squared minus 6 right parenthesis comma x Superscript 1 Baseline element of double struck upper R comma x squared element of double struck upper R period f (x1, x2) = (x1, x2, 2x1 + 3x2 −6), x1 ∈R, x2 ∈R.
We will see that the vectors StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction ∂f
∂x1 and StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x squared EndFraction ∂f
∂x2 are the key for describing the geometry 
of the surface f f . 
• A surface in the Euclidean three-dimensional space upper E cubedE3 is a smooth mapping f f
of an open set upper U subset of double struck upper R squaredU ⊂R2 into upper E cubedE3 with an extra property: at each point f left parenthesis x right parenthesis f (x) of the 
surface, there must be a tangent plane (Figs. 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8).

The Metric of a Surface 
We have now all the ingredients to deﬁne the coefﬁcients of the metric of a surfacef f . 
• Denote by g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals left angle bracket StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis comma StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis right angle bracket periodgi j (x) :=

• It is easy to observe the symmetry of the g Subscript i jgi j coefﬁcients, i.e. g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals g Subscript j i Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgi j(x) = g ji(x). 
Where do these coefﬁcients come from? 
If 
upper X left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals upper X Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis e 1 plus upper X squared left parenthesis x right parenthesis e 2 comma upper Y left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals upper Y Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis e 1 plus upper Y squared left parenthesis x right parenthesis e 2 element of upper T Subscript x Baseline upper UX(x) = X1(x)e1 + X2(x)e2,
Y(x) = Y 1(x)e1 + Y 2(x)e2 ∈TxU, then the

Now, if we compute left angle bracket d f Subscript x Baseline upper X comma d f Subscript x Baseline upper Y right angle bracket<d fx X, d fxY> in upper T Subscript f left parenthesis x right parenthesis Baseline fT f (x) f , we obtain

therefore we highlight the g Subscript i jgi j coefﬁcients. The Einstein summation convention 
simpliﬁes the last formula, 
left angle bracket d f Subscript x Baseline upper X comma d f Subscript x Baseline upper Y right angle bracket equals g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis upper X Superscript i Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis upper Y Superscript j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis period <d fx X, d fxY> = gi j(x)Xi(x)Y j(x).
A direct consequence of the deﬁnition is 
left angle bracket d f Subscript x Baseline upper X comma d f Subscript x Baseline upper X right angle bracket equals g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis upper X Superscript i Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis upper X Superscript j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis greater than or slanted equals 0 period <d fx X, d fx X> = gi j(x)Xi(x)X j(x) > 0.
• The last formula highlights a quadratic form denoted by d s squaredds2 which acts after the

if the vector upper XX is thought as upper X equals left parenthesis upper X Superscript 1 Baseline comma upper X squared right parenthesis periodX = (X1, X2). We cancelled the variable xx to give 
the image usually seen in textbooks. 
Taking into account thatd x Superscript i Baseline left parenthesis upper X right parenthesis equals upper X Superscript idxi(X) = Xi, the previous formula of the quadratic form 
can be written in the simpliﬁed form 
d s squared equals g 11 dot left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus g 12 dot d x Superscript 1 Baseline d x squared plus g 21 dot d x squared d x Superscript 1 Baseline plus g 22 dot left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squaredds2 = g11 ·

or, using the Einstein notation,

This quadratic form is called the metric for the surface f f .

Example 4.3.1 (Metric of the plane z = 0) Let us consider a plane having the 
algebraic equation z equals 0z = 0. When we study surfaces from the Differential Geom-

StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x squared EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 0 comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesis comma ∂f
∂x2 (x) = (0, 1, 0),
therefore the metric of the plane is 
d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squaredds2 = (dx1)2 + (dx2)2
as we expected because it is related to the 2D restriction of the quadratic form attached 
to the 3d Euclidean inner product. 
Example 4.3.2 (Metric of the sphere) Consider the unit sphere as it appears at the 
beginning of Sect. 1.2: 
f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis comma x Superscript 1 Baseline element of left parenthesis 0 comma pi right parenthesis comma x squared element of left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesis period f (x1, x2) = (sin x1 cos x2, sin x1 sin x2, cos x1), x1 ∈(0, π), x2 ∈(0, 2π).
In order to compute the metric coefﬁcients g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgi j(x), we ﬁrst compute 
StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma minus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis ∂f
∂x1 (x) = (cos x1 cos x2, cos x1 sin x2, −sin x1)
StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x squared EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis minus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma 0 right parenthesis period ∂f
∂x2 (x) = (−sin x1 sin x2, sin x1 cos x2, 0).
Then we use the formula g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals left angle bracket StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis comma StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis right angle bracketgi j (x) =

taking into account the 
Euclidean inner product, i.e. left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket colon equals a 0 b 0 plus a 1 b 1 plus a 2 b 2 period<a, b> := a0b0 + a1b1 + a2b2.

Often, textbooks present such formulas without the upper indexes, that is the 
sphere is parameterized in the form

and the metric is visualized in the simpler form 
d s squared equals left parenthesis d u right parenthesis squared plus sine squared u left parenthesis d v right parenthesis squared periodds2 = (du)2 + sin2 u (dv)2.
At the end of computations, we can say that “usingx Superscript 1 Baseline equals ux1 = u andx squared equals vx2 = v the formulas 
obtained are written in the following form...” and the formulas obtained have a more 
agreeable aspect. One more comment: if the sphere has radius upper RR, i.e.

Example 4.3.3 (Metric of the pseudosphere) Another important example of surface 
is the pseudosphere proposed by Eugenio Beltrami. The pseudosphere is obtained 
from the rotation of a tractrix curve around an axis. The tractrix is imagined as “a 
curve whose tangents are all of equal length” in the sense we explain below. At a 
given point upper AA of the tractrix, we consider the tangent. The tangent intersects the 
tractrix asymptote at a second point denoted by upper BB. upper A upper BAB is the segment of constant 
length we refer above. If the initial point is left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesis(1, 0) and the asymptote is the y minusy−axis, 
the constant length becomes 11. 
Identifying the tractrix equation y equals y left parenthesis x right parenthesisy = y(x) means to select the point where the 
tangent line equation 
upper Y minus y left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals y prime left parenthesis x right parenthesis dot left parenthesis upper X minus x right parenthesisY −y(x) = y'(x) · (X −x)
intersects the lineupper X equals 0X = 0. It resultsupper Y equals y left parenthesis x right parenthesis minus x dot y prime left parenthesis x right parenthesisY = y(x) −x · y'(x). The constant length, from 
the deﬁnition 
left parenthesis upper Y minus y left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesis squared plus x squared equals 1 comma x element of left parenthesis 0 comma 1 right parenthesis comma(Y −y(x))2 + x2 = 1, x ∈(0, 1) ,
leads to the tractrix differential equation

another surface f overTilde equals upper B degrees f colon upper U long right arrow upper E cubed ˜f = B ◦f : U −→E3. A vector is transformed by an isometry 
into another vector having the same length. Two vectors with the same application

transformed vectors have their lengths preserved. It is easy to observe that their 
initial angle between them is also preserved. 
Taking into consideration all these observations, the metric coefﬁcients g Subscript i jgi j are 
preserved by isometries of the Euclidean space.

• Two properties of a curve on a surface are important. 
The tangent vector ModifyingAbove c With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙c(t) belongs to the tangent plane to the surface upper T Subscript c left parenthesis t right parenthesis Baseline fTc(t) f . 
The length of this tangent vector depends on the coefﬁcients g Subscript i jgi j of the metric. 
The ﬁrst one comes from the computation:

and represents a metric change at the level of each tangent plane. To continue, it 
is simple to observe that the Euclidean 3D inner product determines a metric and 
this metric has the form d s squared equals d upper X 1 squared plus d upper Y 1 squared plus d upper Z 1 squaredds2 = d X2

d s squared equals g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline periodds2 = gi j(x)dxidx j.
How it works the previous formula when we intend to compute effectively the 
metric of surfaces? 
Example 4.4.1 (Metric of the sphere computed from the direct transfer of the ambi-
ent Euclidean metric) Let us see the example with the metric of the unit sphere. The 
metric of the ambient Euclidean 3D space is 
d s squared equals d upper X 1 squared plus d upper Y 1 squared plus d upper Z 1 squared commads2 = d X2
1 + dY 2
1 + dZ2
1,
while 
upper X 1 equals sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma upper Y 1 equals sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma upper Z 1 equals cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline periodX1 = sin x1 cos x2, Y1 = sin x1 sin x2, Z1 = cos x1.
Therefore 
d upper X 1 equals cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared d x Superscript 1 Baseline minus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared d x squaredd X1 = cos x1 cos x2dx1 −sin x1 sin x2dx2
d upper Y 1 equals cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared d x Superscript 1 Baseline plus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared d x squared commadY1 = cos x1 sin x2dx1 + sin x1 cos x2dx2,
d upper Z 1 equals minus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline d x Superscript 1 Baseline perioddZ1 = −sin x1dx1.
Computing 
d upper X 1 squared plus d upper Y 1 squared plus d upper Z 1 squaredd X2
1 + dY 2
1 + dZ2
1
it results the metric of the unit sphere in the form 
d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus sine squared x Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared periodds2 = (dx1)2 + sin2 x1 (dx2)2.
Let see how it works the above approach in the case of the pseudosphere. 
Example 4.4.2 (Metric of the pseudosphere computed from direct transfer of the 
ambient Euclidean metric) The surface form 
f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline plus ln left parenthesis tangent left parenthesis StartFraction x Superscript 1 Baseline Over 2 EndFraction right parenthesis right parenthesis right parenthesis comma x Superscript 1 Baseline element of left parenthesis 0 comma StartFraction pi Over 2 EndFraction right parenthesis comma x squared element of left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesis comma f (x1, x2) =

(
tan
( x1

)))
, x1 ∈

2
)
, x2 ∈(0, 2π),
makes us to consider the parameterization 
upper X 1 equals sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma upper Y 1 equals sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma upper Z 1 equals cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline plus ln left parenthesis tangent left parenthesis StartFraction x Superscript 1 Baseline Over 2 EndFraction right parenthesis right parenthesis periodX1 = sin x1 cos x2, Y1 = sin x1 sin x2, Z1 = cos x1 + ln

.
Therefore 
d upper X 1 equals cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared d x Superscript 1 Baseline minus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared d x squaredd X1 = cos x1 cos x2dx1 −sin x1 sin x2dx2
d upper Y 1 equals cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared d x Superscript 1 Baseline plus sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared d x squared commadY1 = cos x1 sin x2dx1 + sin x1 cos x2dx2,

d upper Z 1 equals StartFraction cosine squared x Superscript 1 Baseline Over sine x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction d x Superscript 1 Baseline perioddZ1 = cos2 x1

Computing 
d upper X 1 squared plus d upper Y 1 squared plus d upper Z 1 squaredd X2
1 + dY 2
1 + dZ2
1
it results the metric of the pseudosphere in the form 
d s squared equals cotangent squared x Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus sine squared x Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared periodds2 = cot2 x1 (
dx1)2 + sin2 x1 (
dx2)2 .
So, it becomes clear that the metric of any surface can be easily determined after 
we compute the differentials d upper X 1 comma d upper Y 1d X1, dY1 and d upper Z 1dZ1 of the given parameterization of 
the surface and we introduce them into the metric of the ambient space, here the 
Euclidean 3D one: d s squared equals d upper X 1 squared plus d upper Y 1 squared plus d upper Z 1 squared periodds2 = d X2
1 + dY 2
1 + dZ2
1.
To anticipate, the metric can be obtained with this very simple procedure even 
if the ambient space is not the Euclidean one. Supposing the metric of the ambient 
space is d s squared equals d upper X 1 squared minus d upper Y 1 squared minus d upper Z 1 squaredds2 = d X2
1 −dY 2
1 −dZ2
1 and replacing there the differentials d upper X 1 comma d upper Y 1d X1, dY1
and d upper Z 1dZ1 of the given parameterization of the surface, we obtain the metric of the 
surface corresponding to the new ambient space.

Therefore the lengths of tangent vectors to curves on a surface depend on the 
coefﬁcients of the metric of the surface; the length of curves on a surface depends 
on the metric of the surface; the angle between two tangent vectors and, as a 
consequence, the angle between two curves depends on the metric of the surface. 
It can be proven that the area of a region on a surface depends on the metric of the 
surface. The formula for the area of a region f left parenthesis upper D right parenthesis comma upper D subset of upper U f (D), D ⊂U is

All the possible geometric properties, depending on the metric of the surface, are 
called intrinsic geometric properties of a surface. Therefore, we can say that 
– the length of a curve, 
– the angle between two curves, 
– the area of a region, 
are concepts belonging to the intrinsic geometry of the surface. 
The change of coordinates and the isometries preserve the intrinsic nature of geo-
metric properties.

to a basis StartSet e 1 comma e 2 EndSet{e1, e2}, it is highlighted a 2 times 22 × 2 matrix. 
The Weingarten matrix presented above is, as we mentioned, such a matrix 
which allows to express the vectors StartSet minus StartFraction partial differential upper N Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis comma StartFraction partial differential upper N Over partial differential x squared EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis EndSet

. 
We present now the deﬁnition of one of the most important concepts of the Dif-
ferential Geometry, the Gaussian curvature of a surface f f at a point f left parenthesis x right parenthesis f (x). 
Denoted by upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesisK(x), it is expressed by the formula 
upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals d e t left parenthesis h Subscript j Superscript i Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesis periodK(x) := det(hi
j(x)).
The determinant of the Weingarten matrix plays the role of a quantity which has 
to express the “bending” of a surface at a point. 
• A direct consequence is the formula 
upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals StartFraction d e t left parenthesis h Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesis Over d e t left parenthesis g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesis EndFractionK(x) = det(hi j(x))
det(gi j(x))
which allows the quick computation of the curvature of surfaces at a point. 
The previous examples show us that 
• The Gaussian curvature of the planez equals 0z = 0 at each point isupper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 0K(x) = 0, because 
det h Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 0det hi j(x) = 0. 
• The Gaussian curvature of a sphere of radius upper RR at each point is upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R squared EndFractionK(x) = 1
R2 , 
which can be computed directly using the Weingarten matrix formula.

Revisiting the Differential Geometry …
Besides, one can compute it using det h Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals upper R squared sine squared x Superscript 1det hi j(x) = R2 sin2 x1 and det g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals upper R Superscript 4 Baseline sine squared x Superscript 1 Baseline perioddet gi j(x) =
R4 sin2 x1.
We leave to the reader two problems related to the computation of the Gaussian 
curvature. It is important not only to compute it but also to understand how we 
establish the parameterizations for cylinder and cone surfaces below. The reader 
has to be inspired from how we established the parameterizations for plane, 
sphere, and pseudosphere. 
Problem 4.7.1 Compute the Gaussian curvature at a point of a circular cylinder. 
Hint: f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis upper R cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline comma upper R sine x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis semicolon upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 0 semicolon f (x1, x2) = (R cos x1, R sin x1, x2); K(x) = 0;
Problem 4.7.2 Compute the Gaussian curvature at a point of a circular cone. 
Hint. f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x squared cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared sine x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis semicolon upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 0 semicolon f (x1, x2) = (x2 cos x1, x2 sin x1, x2); K(x) = 0;
The result in both cases is upper K equals 0K = 0. We can understand now the word “bending” 
used above. There is a way of bending a plane, at least locally, to obtain a cylinder 
or a cone. The curvature upper K equals 0K = 0 allows this. The question is if there is a similar 
explanation for surfaces having non-zero Gaussian curvature. 
The answer will be obtained after understanding the nature of Gaussian curvature. 
• First, let us observe that Gaussian curvature of a surface f f at a point f left parenthesis x right parenthesis f (x)
remains invariant under a change of coordinates. This happens because the metric 
coefﬁcients g Subscript i jgi j and the matrix h Subscript i jhi j coefﬁcients are preserved at the corresponding 
points by a change of coordinates. 
• The Gaussian curvature is related to the fact that the surface “lives” in the ambient 
3D Euclidean space upper E cubedE3. So, the curvature seems to be an “extrinsic” property of 
a surface. In order to give more details, the Gaussian curvature depends on h Subscript i jhi j
matrix whose elements are described with respect to the Gauss map upper N left parenthesis x right parenthesisN(x). If we  
look carefully, there is a determinant involvingh Subscript i jhi j which is an area of a well chosen 
parallelogram. 
We can prove that this area can be written with respect to the metric components 
g Subscript i jgi j, i.e. the Gaussian curvature is part of the intrinsic geometry of a surface. 
Then, only the metric will be important because we can ﬁnd a procedure to transfer 
it from a set to another. Say, if we transfer the metric of a plane to a sphere, our 
intuition regarding the “shape” of surfaces will be no longer important. Because 
the sphere has its Gaussian curvature depending on the transferred metric from 
the plane, it is upper K equals 0K = 0. 
In the same way, we can transfer the metric of a given sphere to a plane, offering 
the Gaussian curvature upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 1 divided by upper R squaredK(x) = 1/R2 to the plane. The 00 curvature intuition for the 
plane will disappear.

Revisiting the Differential Geometry …
Therefore the absolute value of Gaussian curvature is the ratio of two areas of par-
allelograms determined by the vectors involved in Weingarten’s relations. 
A consequence of this result is: Gaussian curvature is preserved by isometries of 
the Euclidean space upper E cubedE3. 
Why? Isometries are maps which preserve distances. And angles, too. Therefore 
areas of triangles are also preserved. So, the areas of parallelograms are preserved.

All the following results, i.e. Gauss formulas, Gauss equations, Theorema Egregium, 
were obtained by Gauss and they look different with respect to the modern view. 
Elwin Bruno Christoffel and Bernhard Riemann succeeded to simplify the form of 
Gauss results after they introduced the so-called Christoffel symbols and Riemann 
symbols we are going to study below. 
We deﬁne the Christoffel symbols of ﬁrst kind, 
normal upper Gamma Subscript i j comma k Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals one half left parenthesis StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis plus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript j k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis minus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesisnormal upper Gamma Subscript i j comma k Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals one half left parenthesis StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis plus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript j k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis minus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesisTi j,k(x) := 1

and the Christoffel symbols of second kind, as  
normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript i Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals g Superscript i s Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis normal upper Gamma Subscript j k comma s Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals one half g Superscript i s Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis left parenthesis StartFraction partial differential g Subscript j s Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis plus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript k s Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis minus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript j k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript s Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis x right parenthesis right parenthesis commaTi

)
,
where g Superscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgi j(x) is the inverse of the matrix of the coefﬁcients g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgi j(x) of the metric. 
An important observation is the fact that these matrices, which are each other 
inverse, follow the formula 
g Superscript s j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis g Subscript i s Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals g Subscript i s Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis g Superscript s j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals delta Subscript i Superscript jgsj(x)gis(x) = gis(x)gsj(x) = δ j

which is expressed using the Einstein notation. 
Of course, one can calculate each g Superscript i jgi j exactly as one did it when he studied the 
inverse of a matrix, that is g Superscript 11 Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals StartFraction g 22 left parenthesis x right parenthesis Over d e t left parenthesis g Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis EndFractiong11(x) = g22(x)
det(gi j), etc.  
In order to simplify the notation, we cancel xx in all the formulas below.

The inner product of both members of upper NN leads to a Subscript i k Baseline equals h Subscript i k Baseline commaaik = hik, where h Subscript i khik are the 
components of the matrix which appeared when we studied the Weingarten matrix. 
We obtain

and this can be written as

Adding the ﬁrst two and subtracting the last one, we have 
StartFraction partial differential g Subscript j k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction plus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction minus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction equals 2 upper A Subscript i j Superscript s Baseline dot g Subscript s k Baseline comma∂g jk

• the Ricci symbols by: upper R Subscript i j Baseline colon equals upper R Subscript i s j Superscript sRi j := Rs
isj. 
All these symbols depend only ong Subscript i jgi j, i.e. they belong to the intrinsic geometry of 
surfaces. 
Let us ﬁrst observe that the metric coefﬁcients g Subscript i jgi j allow us to lower indexes as in 
the formula 
upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline equals g Subscript i s Baseline upper R Subscript j k l Superscript s Baseline periodRi jkl = gis Rs
jkl.
The components of the inverse matrix of the metric coefﬁcients allow us to rise 
indexes, that is 
upper R Subscript j k l Superscript i Baseline equals g Superscript i s Baseline upper R Subscript s j k l Baseline periodRi
jkl = gis Rsjkl.
The last formula can be derived if we multiply by g Subscript m igmi and we consider the sum 
after the dummy index ii. It results g Subscript m i Baseline upper R Subscript j k l Superscript i Baseline equals g Subscript m i Baseline g Superscript i s Baseline upper R Subscript s j k l Baseline commagmi Ri
jkl = gmigis Rsjkl, that is the equality 
upper R Subscript m j k l Baseline equals upper R Subscript m j k lRmjkl = Rmjkl holds.

The same from upper T Subscript alpha l m n Superscript jT j

The Gauss Equations and the Theorema Egregium 
The result we wish to prove, i.e. the celebrated Theorema Egregium, clariﬁes an 
important aspect of the Differential Geometry of surfaces. The Gaussian curvature of 
the surface depends only on the metric. Gauss called this important result Theorema 
Egregium, i.e. the Remarkable Theorem. The result appeared in 1827 in a paper 
entitled “General Investigations of Curved Surfaces”. The original title was in Latin, 
Disquisitiones Generales circa Superﬁcies Curvas [105]. 
Theorem 4.10.1 For any surface the following equality holds 
upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline equals h Subscript i k Baseline dot h Subscript j l Baseline minus h Subscript i l Baseline dot h Subscript j kRi jkl = hik · h jl −hil · h jk

The previous theorem shows that the Gauss curvature belongs to the intrinsic 
geometry of a surface. 
As we discussed earlier, this important result allows us to think about Differential 
Geometry in a more general frame, for example, considering sets of coordinates 
which are not necessarily embedded in a geometric structured space with an extra 
dimension. The Differential Geometry of such a set will be described only by a 
“metric tensor”, i.e. the matrix g Subscript i jgi j, which gives the metric 
d s squared equals g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline periodds2 = gi j(x)dxidx j.
The metric is the only ingredient we need to develop the Differential Geometry on 
sets of coordinates without extra dimensions. 
Example 4.10.4 (Gaussian curvature of pseudosphere computed by Theorema 
Egregium) Let us revisit the surface proposed by Eugenio Beltrami in his 1868 
paper [179] on models of hyperbolic geometries, the pseudosphere.

was obtained before when we studied the tractrix. The aim is to compute its curvature 
using the Theorema Egregium. The computations start with the Christoffel symbols 
of the ﬁrst kind: 
normal upper Gamma Subscript 22 comma 2 Baseline equals normal upper Gamma Subscript 12 comma 1 Baseline equals normal upper Gamma Subscript 21 comma 1 Baseline equals normal upper Gamma Subscript 11 comma 2 Baseline equals 0T22,2 = T12,1 = T21,1 = T11,2 = 0

Example 4.10.5 (Gaussian curvature of a sphere computed by Theorema Egregium) 
In the section devoted to extrinsic geometric properties of a surface, we computed 
the Gaussian curvature of sphere of radius upper RR and we found that upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R squared EndFractionK(x) = 1

intend to compute the same Gaussian curvature, now using the Theorema Egregium.

Let us conclude. In some examples we noticed the existence of surfaces with null 
Gaussian curvature as the plane, the circular cylinder, and the circular cone. For these 
surfaces, the Theorema Egregium works easy: the null Gaussian curvature happens 
because all normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript i Baseline equals 0 periodTi
jk = 0. We also highlighted spheres as surfaces of positive constant 
Gaussian curvature. On the other hand, the pseudosphere was a ﬁrst example of a 
surface with constant negative curvature. Later in this book, we will study the con-
nection between surfaces of constant Gaussian curvature and classical geometries, 
i.e. Euclidean, Spherical, and Non-Euclidean.
4.11 The Einstein Theorem

4.11 
The Einstein Theorem 
Consider the Ricci symbols deﬁned by the “contraction” of the Ricci symbol upper R Subscript j k l Superscript iRi
jkl, 
i.e. 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline colon equals upper R Subscript i s j Superscript s Baseline equals upper R Subscript i Baseline 1 j Superscript 1 Baseline plus upper R Subscript i Baseline 2 j Superscript 2Ri j := Rs
isj = R1
i1 j + R2
i2 j
The name of these symbols is related to the Italian mathematician Gregorio Ricci 
Curbastro whose work, together with his student Tullio Levi-Civita in tensor calculus, 
made possible the development of General Relativity language. 
Theorem 4.11.1 (Einstein) For a surface f f , the Ricci tensor is proportional to the 
metric tensor via the Gaussian curvature, i.e. 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals upper K left parenthesis x right parenthesis dot g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis periodRi j(x) = K(x) · gi j(x).
Proof Let us drop xx in the notation and compute the four Ricci symbols. 
upper R 11 equals upper R Subscript 1 s Baseline 1 Superscript s Baseline equals upper R 111 Superscript 1 Baseline plus upper R 121 squared equals 0 plus upper R 121 squared equals upper R 121 squared periodR11 = Rs
1s1 = R1
111 + R2
121 = 0 + R2
121 = R2
121.
Since 
upper R 121 squared equals g Superscript 2 s Baseline dot upper R Subscript s Baseline 121 Baseline commaR2
121 = g2 s · Rs121,
it results 
upper R 11 equals g Superscript 21 Baseline dot upper R 1121 plus g Superscript 22 Baseline dot upper R 2121 equals 0 plus g Superscript 22 Baseline dot upper R 2121 equalsR11 = g21 · R1121 + g22 · R2121 = 0 + g22 · R2121 =

g11
det
(
gi j
) · R1212 =
R1212
det
(

) · g11 = K · g11.
In a similar way, starting from the Ricci symbol upper R 22R22, we have  
upper R 22 equals upper R Subscript 2 s Baseline 2 Superscript s Baseline equals upper R 212 Superscript 1 Baseline plus upper R 222 squared equals upper R 212 Superscript 1 Baseline plus 0 equals upper R 212 Superscript 1 Baseline periodR22 = Rs
2s2 = R1
212 + R2
222 = R1
212 + 0 = R1
212.
Then 
upper R 212 Superscript 1 Baseline equals g Superscript 1 s Baseline dot upper R Subscript s Baseline 212R1
212 = g1 s · Rs212
implies 
upper R 22 equals g Superscript 11 Baseline dot upper R 1212 plus g Superscript 12 Baseline dot upper R 2212 equals g Superscript 11 Baseline dot upper R 1212 plus 0 equals StartFraction g 22 Over det left parenthesis g Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis EndFraction dot upper R 1212 equals upper K dot g 22 periodR22 = g11 · R1212 + g12 · R2212 = g11 · R1212 + 0 =
g22
det
(
gi j
) · R1212 = K · g22.
A little bit more complicated is for upper R 12 periodR12.
upper R 12 equals upper R Subscript 1 s Baseline 2 Superscript s Baseline equals upper R 112 Superscript 1 Baseline plus upper R 122 squared equals g Superscript 1 s Baseline dot upper R Subscript s Baseline 112 Baseline plus g Superscript 2 s Baseline dot upper R Subscript s Baseline 122 Baseline equalsR12 = Rs
1s2 = R1
112 + R2
122 = g1 s · Rs112 + g2 s · Rs122 =
equals g Superscript 11 Baseline dot upper R 1112 plus g Superscript 12 Baseline dot upper R 2112 plus g Superscript 21 Baseline dot upper R 1122 plus g Superscript 22 Baseline dot upper R 2122 equals = g11 · R1112 + g12 · R2112 + g21 · R1122 + g22 · R2122 =

A ﬁrst consequence of the Einstein theorem is related to the symmetry of Ricci’s 
symbols for surfaces, so, for a given surface, it results upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals upper R Subscript j iRi j = R ji. This result is 
obtained in the case of two variables. A general result about the symmetry of the 
Ricci symbols and their geometric nature is presented in the next chapter. 
Why this result is related to Einstein? Let us rise one of the indexes, 
upper R Subscript j Superscript i Baseline equals g Superscript i s Baseline upper R Subscript s jRi
j = gis Rsj
and deﬁne the scalar curvature upper RR or the Ricci curvature upper RR by the formula 
upper R colon equals upper R Subscript i Superscript i Baseline equals upper R 1 Superscript 1 Baseline plus upper R 2 squared periodR := Ri
i = R1
1 + R2
2.
It is easy to see that 
upper R 1 Superscript 1 Baseline equals upper R 2 squared equals upper K comma i period e period upper R equals 2 upper K periodR1
1 = R2
2 = K, i.e. R = 2K.
Therefore the Einstein theorem can be written un the form 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 periodRi j −1
2 R · gi j = 0.
The left member of this equality is the Einstein tensor and it appears in the Einstein 
ﬁelds equations we will derive latter.

One of the most important deﬁnitions of Differential Geometry of surfaces is the 
parallel transport of a vector ﬁeld along a curve. The parallel transport along a curve

Therefore, the equations of the parallel transport are

that, at p equals c left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis commap = c(t0), it is upper X left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis equals upper V Subscript pX(t0) = Vp.

Example 4.12.1 The case of parallel transport along any curve of the plane We 
may consider, without loss of generality, that the algebraic equation of the plane is 
z equals 0z = 0. Then for the surface f f is f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma 0 right parenthesis f (x1, x2) = (x1, x2, 0), the metric is

ModifyingAbove upper X With dot Superscript k Baseline left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 0 comma k element of StartSet 1 comma 2 EndSet period ˙Xk (t) = 0, k ∈{1, 2}.
It results, by integration, that the vector ﬁeldupper XX is a constant one, i.e.upper X left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals left parenthesis a comma b right parenthesisX(t) = (a, b). 
If we are looking at the support lines of this vector ﬁeld along a given line, we see 
Euclidean parallel lines, therefore we understand the meaning of the parallel transport 
above.

A ﬁrst example is the vectorleft parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma upper R right parenthesis(0, 0, R) which is obtained whena equals 0a = 0 andb equals negative 1b = −1. 
This vector is always parallel to zz-axis and it is parallel transported at each point 
along the equator. Another important example is the tangent vector to the equator, 
ModifyingAbove c With dot Subscript e Baseline left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals left parenthesis minus sine t comma cosine t comma 0 right parenthesis˙ce(t) = (−sin t, cos t, 0) which is obtained when a equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R EndFractiona = 1
R and b equals 0b = 0. The tangent 
vector is parallel transported at each point along the equator. 
In the particular case when the tangent ﬁeld ModifyingAbove c With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙c (t) to the curve cc is parallel trans-
ported along the curve, then the curve cc, by deﬁnition, is called a geodesic of the 
surface f f . 
The previous example shows that the equator of the sphere is a geodesic of the 
sphere because the tangent vector to equator is parallel transported. In an example

The system of equations for geodesics is completely determined if we consider 
an initial condition which is similar to the one presented in the case of the parallel 
transport: 
• a point c left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesisc(t0) of the geodesic; 
• the initial vector v Subscript c left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis Baseline equals left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove x With dot squared left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis right parenthesisvc(t0) = (˙x1(t0), ˙x2(t0)).

g 11 equals upper R squared comma g 22 equals upper R squared sine squared x 1 comma g 12 equals g 21 equals 0g11 = R2, g22 = R2 sin2 x1, g12 = g21 = 0, g Superscript 11 Baseline equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R squared EndFraction comma g Superscript 22 Baseline equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R squared sine squared x 1 EndFraction comma g Superscript 12 Baseline equals g Superscript 21 Baseline equals 0g11 = 1

11 = T2
11 = T1
12 = T1
21 = T2
22 = 0, T2
12 = T2
21 = cot x1, T1
22 = −sin x1 cos x1.
Now we can replace the variables with the initial ones. The geodesic equation, written 
for the ﬁrst variable, is 
x With two dots minus sine x cosine x dot left parenthesis ModifyingAbove y With dot right parenthesis squared equals 0 period¨x −sin x cos x · ( ˙y)2 = 0.
For the second variable yy, the geodesic equation is 
y With two dots plus 2 cotangent x dot ModifyingAbove x With dot ModifyingAbove y With dot equals 0 period¨y + 2 cot x · ˙x ˙y = 0.
We may observe that x equals StartFraction pi Over 2 EndFraction comma y equals sx = π
2 , y = s is a solution, therefore c left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals left parenthesis upper R cosine s comma upper R sine s comma 0 right parenthesisc(s) = (R cos s,
R sin s, 0) is a geodesic of the sphere. It is the great circle obtained at the inter-
section of the plane z equals 0z = 0 with the sphere. We found this geodesic and presented 
it in the example related to the parallel transport. If we rotate the sphere around its 
centre, another great circle replaces the equator and therefore becomes a geodesic. 
So the geodesics of the spheres are the great circles of the sphere. The terminology 
is related to the fact that among all circles obtained at the intersection of a sphere by
4.12 Covariant Derivative, Parallel Transport and Geodesics
103
planes, the maximum radius is for the circles obtained at the intersection of planes 
passing through the centre of the sphere. 
A comment is important at this point: a rotation of the sphere around the origin 
means a change of coordinates of the sphere. The above result can be reformulated 
as “the change of coordinates mapping a geodesic into another geodesic”. This result 
is proved in the next chapter but we mentioned it now to show that all great circles 
are geodesics of the sphere. 
In all examples, the tangent vector to geodesic has constant length. This is a 
general property for geodesics and the proof of this fact is also provided in the next 
chapter. 
Before continuing, it is better to add something about curves in a 3 upper D3D-Euclidean 
space. The differential properties of curves are described by a special frame, called 
the Frenet frame. Such a frame depends on the vectors ModifyingAbove c With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙c(t) and c With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis¨c(t) which describe 
the osculating plane. Using these two vectors one can construct another two vectors, 
StartSet e 1 left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma e 2 left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndSet{e1(t), e2(t)}, which form an orthonormal frame in the osculating plane. Considering 
e 3 colon equals e 1 times e 2e3 := e1 × e2 the setStartSet e 1 left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma e 2 left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma e 3 left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndSet{e1(t), e2(t), e3(t)} becomes the Frenet frame at each pointc left parenthesis t right parenthesisc(t)
of the curve. The Frenet frame describes the curvatureupper K 1 left parenthesis t right parenthesisK1(t) and the torsionupper K 2 left parenthesis t right parenthesisK2(t) at 
each point of the curve. Curves included in a plane are characterized by null torsion. 
In this case e 3 left parenthesis t right parenthesise3(t) is a constant vector along cc and e 1e1 and e 2e2 are obviously included 
in the plane where the curve lies. 
If the curve lies on a surfacef f , we can deﬁne the Darboux frame. This is formed 
by the previous unit speed vector e 1 equals StartFraction ModifyingAbove c With dot Over StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue ModifyingAbove c With dot StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue EndFractione1 =
˙c
||˙c|| and another two vectors. One of them 
is the Gauss vectorupper N left parenthesis t right parenthesisN(t) which is part of the Gauss frame ande left parenthesis t right parenthesis colon equals upper N left parenthesis t right parenthesis times e 1 left parenthesis t right parenthesise(t) := N(t) × e1(t). 
The frame StartSet e 1 left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma upper N left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma e left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndSet{e1(t), N(t), e(t)} coexists together with the Frenet frame if a curve is 
part of a surface. A very nice result which can be proved is the following: 
The curvecc is  a geodesic off f if and only ife 2 left parenthesis t right parenthesise2(t) andupper N left parenthesis t right parenthesisN(t) are collinear vectors. 
To prove this statement, let us consider a sphere with a great circle. This circle is 
included in a plane, therefore the torsion of it is 00 at each point c left parenthesis t right parenthesisc(t). It results that 
e 1e1 is tangent to the circle and e 2e2 is included in the plane of the curve such that the 
line containing e 2e2 passes through the centre of the sphere. The same line contains 
the Gauss vector upper NN, therefore upper NN and e 2e2 are collinear. The great circle is a geodesic. 
The theory presented above is true in the Minkowski spaces, therefore planes con-
taining the origin intersects Minkowski spheres after geodesic curves. More proper-
ties about the Minkowski spaces will be discussed below, when we will consider the 
possibility that the ambient 3 upper D3D space is not an Euclidean one. 
Example 4.12.6 Gaussian curvature and parallel transport Consider the previ-
ous sphere, its equator and two meridians. The meridians are part of great circles, 
therefore they are geodesics. The same holds for the equator. 
Denote by upper NN the “North Pole” of the sphere and by upper AA and upper BB the intersections 
between the two meridians and the equator. In this way, we obtained the spherical 
triangle upper A upper B upper NABN.

We can choose the coordinates of the points upper N comma upper AN, A and upper BB as left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma upper R right parenthesis comma left parenthesis upper R comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0, R), (R, 0, 0)
and left parenthesis cosine alpha comma sine alpha comma 0 right parenthesis(cos α, sin α, 0) respectively. 
Consider the vector left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma upper R right parenthesis(0, 0, R). This vector is a tangent vector to the ﬁrst meridian 
at upper AA. 
If it is parallel transported to the North Pole upper NN, it becomes upper V equals left parenthesis negative upper R comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesisV = (−R, 0, 0). 
If now we parallel transport it fromupper AA toupper BB, it remainsleft parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma upper R right parenthesis(0, 0, R). Finally, if we parallel 
transport it from upper BB to upper NN, it becomes upper W equals left parenthesis upper R cosine left parenthesis pi plus alpha right parenthesis comma upper R sine left parenthesis pi plus alpha right parenthesis comma 0 right parenthesisW = (R cos(π + α), R sin(π + α), 0). 
The angle between upper VV and upper WW is alphaα. 
Let us observe that if we act in the Euclidean plane and we parallel transport a 
given vector vv along the contour of the upper A upper B upper CABC triangle in the same way, that is from 
upper AA to upper BB, respectively, from upper AA to upper CC then from upper CC to upper BB, it results in the same vector vv, 
therefore the angle between the two ﬁnal vectors is 00. The null Gaussian curvature 
of the plane allows this result. 
The anglealphaα betweenupper VV andupper WW obtained in the case of the sphere is related to the 
curvature of the sphere.

Example 4.13.1 Euclidean metric in polar coordinates Let see how the Euclidean

therefore 
d ModifyingAbove s With quotation dash squared equals d r squared plus r squared d theta squared periodds2 = dr2 + r2dθ2.
This is the Euclidean metric in polar coordinates. Some textbooks use d s squaredds2 instead 
of d ModifyingAbove s With quotation dash squaredds2 because, if you look at the proof above, you can see explicitly the equality 
between the two forms. 
This is also an argument for the statement: a change of coordinates preserves the 
Gaussian curvature at corresponding points.

This space transfers its geometry to surfaces contained in it exactly in the same 
way as the Euclidean space. Only the form of the metric coefﬁcients is different. 
Let see why. Consider the parameterization of a surface in the new space in the

And again all information about the intrinsic geometry is related to the same

Let us present now examples induced by the previous two metrics. 
Example 4.14.1 The time-like sphere in a Minkowskileft parenthesis plus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−) space In the case 
when the 3 upper D3D space is endowed with the metric

we look at the geometry of the surface 
upper X squared minus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals minus upper R squared periodX2 −Y 2 −Z2 = −R2.
According to the signs, the above metric is a Minkowski left parenthesis plus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−) metric and it is 
induced by the quadratic form left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket<u, u> attached to the Minkowski product

We have three types of vectors according to the above Minkowsky product. 
• Timelike vectors, whenleft angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket greater than 0 period<u, u> > 0. An example is the vector u equals left parenthesis 2 comma 1 comma 1 right parenthesisu = (2, 1, 1), or the  
vector u equals left parenthesis 2 x squared plus 1 comma x squared comma x squared right parenthesis comma x element of double struck upper R periodu = (2x2 + 1, x2, x2), x ∈R.
• Space-like vectors, when left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket less than 0 period<u, u> < 0. An example is the vector u equals left parenthesis 1 comma 1 comma 1 right parenthesisu = (1, 1, 1), or  
the vector u equals left parenthesis x squared comma x squared comma x squared plus 2 right parenthesis comma x element of double struck upper R periodu = (x2, x2, x2 + 2), x ∈R.
• Null vectors, also known as lightlike vectors, if left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket equals 0 period<u, u> = 0. An example is the 
vector u equals left parenthesis 2 comma negative 1 comma StartRoot 3 EndRoot right parenthesisu = (2, −1,

2x2), x ∈R. All the 
lightlike vectors can be thought as part of the cone having the equation 
upper X squared minus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals 0 periodX2 −Y 2 −Z2 = 0.
The time-like vectors have the origin (the application point) and the end in the 
interior of the previous cone, while the space-like vectors have the end outside 
the previous cone. 
In a Minkowski 3 upper D3D space there are two types of spheres. 
• Space-like spheres, if the normal are time-like vectors. The sphere having the 
equation 
upper X squared minus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals upper R squaredX2 −Y 2 −Z2 = R2
is such a sphere. To imagine it from the Euclidean point of view, this Minkowski 
sphere is two sheets hyperboloid. 
• Timelike spheres, where normals are space-like vectors. The sphere having the 
equation 
upper X squared minus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals minus upper R squaredX2 −Y 2 −Z2 = −R2
is such a sphere. In our Euclidean intuition, it corresponds to a one-sheet Euclidean 
hyperboloid. Accordingly the geometry, this is a Minkowski sphere. Therefore, in 
this example, we are interested to understand the intrinsic geometry features of 
this time-like sphere.

Arbitrary planes, passing through the origin which intersect the time-like 
Minkowsky sphere, produce curves which are geodesics too, the proof is related to 
a change of coordinates. They are the equivalent of the great circles of an Euclidean 
sphere. 
Example 4.14.2 The time-like sphere in a Minkowskileft parenthesis plus plus minus right parenthesis(+ + −) space In the case 
where the 3 upper D3D space is endowed with the metric 
d s squared equals d upper X squared plus d upper Y squared minus d upper Z squared commads2 = d X2 + dY 2 −dZ2,
we look at the geometry of the surface 
upper X squared plus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals minus upper R squared periodX2 + Y 2 −Z2 = −R2.
The above metric is a Minkowskileft parenthesis plus plus minus right parenthesis(+ + −) metric and it is induced by the quadratic 
form left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket<u, u> attached to the Minkowski product

left angle bracket u comma v right angle bracket equals u Subscript x Baseline v Subscript x Baseline plus u Subscript y Baseline v Subscript y Baseline minus u Subscript z Baseline v Subscript z Baseline period<u, v> = uxvx + uyvy −uzvz.
As in the above example, three kinds of vectors exist according to the new 
Minkowsky product. 
• Timelike vectors, where left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket greater than 0 period<u, u> > 0. An example is the vector u equals left parenthesis 2 comma 1 comma 1 right parenthesisu = (2, 1, 1), or  
the vector u equals left parenthesis x squared plus 1 comma x squared plus 1 comma x squared right parenthesis comma x element of double struck upper R periodu = (x2 + 1, x2 + 1, x2), x ∈R.
• Space-like vectors, where left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket less than 0 period<u, u> < 0. An example is the vector u equals left parenthesis 1 comma 1 comma 3 right parenthesisu = (1, 1, 3), or  
the vector u equals left parenthesis x squared comma x squared comma 2 x squared plus 2 right parenthesis comma x element of double struck upper R periodu = (x2, x2, 2x2 + 2), x ∈R.
• Null vectors, also known as lightlike vectors, where left angle bracket u comma u right angle bracket equals 0 period<u, u> = 0. An example is 
the vector u equals left parenthesis 1 comma negative 1 comma StartRoot 2 EndRoot right parenthesisu = (1, −1,
√

lightlike vectors can be thought as part of the cone having the equation 
upper X squared plus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals 0 periodX2 + Y 2 −Z2 = 0.
The time-like vectors have the origin (application point) and the end in the 
interior of the previous cone, while the space-like vectors have the end outside 
the previous cone. 
These properties are exactly those of the other Minkowski space presented above. 
In this Minkowski 3 upper D3D space, there are also two types of spheres. 
• Space-like spheres, where the normals are time-like vectors. The sphere having 
the equation 
upper X squared plus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals upper R squaredX2 + Y 2 −Z2 = R2
is such a sphere. To imagine it, from the Euclidean point of view, this Minkowski 
sphere is a one-sheet hyperboloid. 
• Timelike spheres, where the normals are space-like vectors. The sphere having the 
equation 
upper X squared plus upper Y squared minus upper Z squared equals minus upper R squaredX2 + Y 2 −Z2 = −R2
is such a sphere. This time-like Minkowski sphere corresponds to two sheets hyper-
boloid. Therefore, in this example, we are interested to understand the geometry 
of this time-like sphere.

Again, arbitrary planes passing through the origin, which intersect the time-like 
Minkowsky sphere, produce curves which are geodesics too, the proof being 
related to a change of coordinates. 
These curves are the equivalent of the great circles of an Euclidean sphere, too.

Transferring Metrics. Is Our Geometric Intuition 
Intrinsically Related to the Reality? 
Let us consider the 3 upper D3D Euclidean ambient space endowed with the metric 
d s squared equals d upper X squared plus d upper Y squared plus d upper Z squared periodds2 = d X2 + dY 2 + dZ2.
The metric of the plane upper Z equals 0Z = 0 is 
d s squared equals d upper X squared plus d upper Y squaredds2 = d X2 + dY 2
with null Gaussian curvature, upper K equals 0K = 0. 
To relate this result with the content of this section, let us take into account the 
translated unit sphere having the center at left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 1 right parenthesis(0, 0, 1), i.e. its equation being 
upper X squared plus upper Y squared plus left parenthesis upper Z minus 1 right parenthesis squared equals 1 periodX2 + Y 2 + (Z −1)2 = 1.
The parameterization

⎧

leads to the metric 
d s squared equals d u squared plus sine squared u d v squaredds2 = du2 + sin2 u dv2
with constant Gaussian curvature, upper K equals 1K = 1. In the case of a sphere of radius upper RR the 
metric is 
d s squared equals upper R squared d u squared plus upper R squared sine squared u d v squared commads2 = R2du2 + R2 sin2 u dv2,
with constant Gaussian curvature upper K equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R squared EndFractionK = 1
R2 . 
Therefore our intuition associates the null curvature to planes and non-null con-
stant positive curvatures to spheres. 
We have the right to think at the “form of geometric objects” having the Gaussian 
curvatures as above. This intuition emerges because we see the plane and the sphere 
as parts of the Euclidean 3 upper D3D space. 
More formally is thinking that the forms of objects has to be understood with 
respect to their intrinsic geometry, given by a metric, which is not necessarily induced 
by the Euclidean 3 upper D3D space. 
What can we prove if a sphere is endowed with a null Gaussian curvature metric? 
Transferring the null Gaussian curvature to a sphere We start with the same 
images, the planeupper Z equals 0Z = 0 and the unit sphereupper X squared plus upper Y squared plus left parenthesis upper Z minus 1 right parenthesis squared equals 1X2 + Y 2 + (Z −1)2 = 1 parameterized

Both metrics have null constant Gaussian curvature because we are transferring 
a null constant Gaussian curvature on the points of a sphere. 
Our imagine about spheres as balls of constant positive Gaussian curvature has to be 
generalized. 
The geometry of a sphere depends only on the metric on it. In this case, the sphere 
has a metric transferred from an Euclidean plane. 
This sphere, without the North Pole upper NN, becomes an image of an Euclidean plane 
with its Euclidean geometry.
4.15 Transferring Metrics. Is Our Geometric Intuition Intrinsically …
117
The geometry of the sphere has geodesics (i.e. lines) transfered from the lines of 
the plane upper Z equals 0Z = 0 (which are geodesics). How they look like? 
The linedd, included inupper Z equals 0Z = 0 together the North Pole, determines a plane. This plane 
intersects the sphere after a circle script upper CC passing through the missing point upper NN, the  North  
Pole. So, the point upper NN is missing from the “line” script upper CC. 
We can observe that the tangent to script upper CC at the missing point upper NN is parallel to dd. script upper CC is a 
line of the sphere having exactly the same properties as an Euclidean line. 
Therefore two Euclidean parallel linesd 1d1 andd 2d2 ofupper Z equals 0Z = 0 determines two Euclidean 
parallel lines, script upper C primeC' and script upper C double primeC'' on the sphere. These two lines are tangent at the missing 
point upper NN. 
All ﬁgures drawn into the plane upper Z equals 0Z = 0 have an image on the sphere, therefore the 
Euclidean ﬁgures we know in the plane have now “another aspect” on the sphere, 
which is now another form of the Euclidean plane. 
The old Euclidean intuition can be replaced. And at least for very intelligent 
ﬁshes in a spherical aquarium, there is a chance to visualize the ﬁgures for solving 
Euclidean geometry problems. 
In the same way, we can generate a positive constant Gaussian curvature of a 
plane.

Revisiting the Differential Geometry …
Its Gaussian curvature is upper K equals 1K = 1. 
From the intrinsic geometric point of view the plane is no longer a plane. It is 
another image of a unit sphere. 
The stereographic projection transfers the geodesics of the initial unit sphere into 
geodesics of the new “sphere”. Among them, the reader can recognize lines passing 
through the South Poleleft parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0, 0) and a circle centred at the South Pole corresponding 
to the equator of the initial unit sphere. 
Any two distinct geodesics will intersect in exact two distinct points. Lines passing 
through the South Pole have the second intersection point “at inﬁnity”, where the 
image of the North Poleupper NN can be imagined. Furthermore, we have another possible 
description of the elliptic geometry. 
The intrinsic geometric is then related only to coordinates and metric and it is not 
related to our corresponding intuition of geometric properties of structures of the 3D 
Euclidean space. 
Next example is particularly important. 
Transferring the constant positive metric of a unit sphere to a plane where 
all geodesics are straight lines Let us consider the unit sphere upper X squared plus upper Y squared plus upper Z squared equals 1X2 + Y 2 + Z2 = 1
centred at the origin. As we know, its metric is 
d s squared equals d phi squared plus sine squared phi d theta squared periodds2 = dφ2 + sin2 φdθ2.
We transfer this metric to the tangent plane at the North Pole upper N left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 1 right parenthesisN(0, 0, 1), denoted 
here by upper T Subscript upper NTN, in the following way. Let left parenthesis u comma v comma 1 right parenthesis(u, v, 1) be an arbitrary point of the tangent 
plane upper T Subscript upper NTN. The straight line

The geodesics inupper T Subscript upper NTN are straight lines obtained from the intersection of the planes of 
the sphere geodesics with upper T Subscript upper NTN. 
Of course, we can force to deﬁne parallel lines inupper T Subscript upper NTN, and the axiom of parallelism 
is fulﬁlled. 
Let us observe that each straight line is in fact doubled by the antipodal points 
corresponding to upper MM. The order of points can be distorted. 
This is a very good example of geometry satisfying the Euclidean parallelism 
axiom without to be an Euclidean geometry. At the same time, this is an example of 
elliptic geometry of the plane where the intersection points of geodesics are seen “at 
inﬁnity”. 
Taking into account the results of this section, i.e. Differential Geometry is only 
related to sets of coordinates and metrics and it is not related to our current intuition, 
we are going to introduce a chapter dedicated to the basic Differential Geometry 
concepts and their applications.
Chapter 5 
Basic Differential Geometry Concepts 
and Their Applications 
The theory of gravitation will not ﬁnd its way into my colleagues’ 
head for longtime yet, no doubt. Only one, Levi-Civita in Padua, 
has probably grasped the main point completely, because he is 
familiar with the mathematics used. 
Albert Einstein 
Einstein’s point of view written above may seem malicious. But almost all the math-
ematics we present in this chapter is related to the work by Tullio Levi-Civita. And 
this work is standing on Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro contribution on tensor calculus. 
Let us recall: the previous chapter allowed us to step into the intrinsic geometry 
of surfaces. In fact we can step into another picture of geometry: the one where 
only the system of coordinates and the metric are necessary. Therefore the surface 
is no longer necessary, the form of the “geometric universe” we study is no longer 
important. The symbols, i.e. the multi-index quantities we studied before, will allow 
us to advance in the geometric structure induced by the metric. We do not know the 
nature of these symbols yet, but we know that, except for the Christoffel ones, they are 
invariant with respect to the changes of coordinates. The same seems to happen with 
the equations of geodesics. The covariant derivative was used with respect to vectors. 
We can think of extending it to the multi-index quantities and obtain new interesting 
geometric laws using it. It is important to see that all formulas we obtained, using the 
additional dimension of the space, can be obtained in the new context when we have 
only the system of coordinates and the metric. In this chapter, we will realize that it 
does not matter that we work with two variables or more in the coordinate system. 
From the very beginning, we shall work with coordinate systems of nn components. 
All these possible features were somehow suggested by the formulas of coordinate 
changes for the coefﬁcients of the metric, Christoffel symbols, Riemann symbols, 
Ricci symbols, etc. 
To step forward, let us say that this is the language we need for General Relativity.

Basic Differential Geometry Concepts and Their Applications
The physical objects described through multi-index quantities have to preserve 
their nature when changes of coordinates are applied. The substance of the Gen-
eral Relativity is related to the invariance of changes of coordinates for geometric 
objects which describe physical objects and this is related to the deep meaning of 
the Equivalence Principle formulated by Einstein generalizing the Galilei one.

Tensors in Differential Geometry. Deﬁnition 
and Examples 
Differential Geometry deals with a set upper MM endowed with a coordinate system 
left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma period period comma x Superscript n Baseline right parenthesis comma(x1, x2, .., xn), x Superscript i Baseline element of double struck upper R xi ∈R. In Physics, the system of coordinates has four components 
and starts from x Superscript 0x0 instead x Superscript 1x1 to make a distinction between the ﬁrst coordinate 
which represents time and the other three coordinates representing spatial coordi-
nates, often denoted by Greek letters, alpha comma betaα, β and gammaγ. We may keep this notation with 
Greek letters even if the number of coordinates is greater than 44 or we can use the 
standard mathematical notation left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma period period comma x Superscript n minus 1 Baseline right parenthesis comma(x0, x1, .., xn−1), x Superscript i Baseline element of double struck upper R xi ∈R. 
The dimension of our setupper MM isnn without insisting here on other possible structures 
of upper MM. The reader has to imagine upper MM as an open set of double struck upper R Superscript nRn whose geometry depends 
on a metric deﬁned on it. 
Let us observe that there is no extra dimensions to studyupper MM. In geometric examples 
below, we choose to use the coordinate system starting withx Superscript 1x1, or we use directly the 
lettersxx,yy, etc. because the physical meaning will be discussed in the other chapters 
below. 
The fundamental object we start to study is the tensor. 
In simple words, a tensor is a multi-index quantity which, under a change of 
coordinates, is transforming linearly with respect to the indexes. The components of 
a tensor depend smoothly on the points of the space, in our case upper MM. So, tensors are 
functions having derivatives of all order everywhere in upper MM.

Let us observe that, in the above deﬁnition of left parenthesis k comma p right parenthesis(k, p) tensor, the contravariant 
indexes change using the inverse transformation of coordinates. The matrix of change 
of coordinates is called Jacobian matrix. The transformation is regular, if the deter-
minant of the Jacobian matrix is always ﬁnite and different from zero. Otherwise, the 
transformation is a singular one. In general, if an object transforms under any change 
of coordinates with a non-singular Jacobian determinant, the object is a tensor. In 
this case the transformation is called linear. The rank of the tensor determines the 
number of Jacobian matrixes concurring in the transformation. For example, a rank 
2 tensor transforms, under coordinate changes, by the multiplication of two Jacobian 
matrices, one for each index. The same happens with contravariant tensors.

Before continuing, we will show that, apart from the direct calculation, there is 
another way to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients of the metric after a change of coordinates. This 
way will be used in some cases in the chapter devoted to General Relativity.

Obviously, we have a similar formula for the inverse of our initial coordinates

Going back to the coefﬁcients of a metric, we notice the following properties: 
1. g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgi j(x) is a smooth function of xx on upper MM; 
2. at each point xx, the metric tensor is symmetric, i.e. g Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals g Subscript j i Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisgi j(x) = g ji(x); 
3. at each pointxx, it exists the  inversebackslash bold upper G Superscript negative 1 Baseline equals left parenthesis g Superscript i j Baseline right parenthesisG−1 = (gi j); using the Einstein notation, the 
inverse is described by the relations: g Superscript i j Baseline g Subscript j k Baseline equals delta Subscript k Superscript i Baseline comma g Subscript j s Baseline g Superscript s k Baseline equals delta Subscript j Superscript kgi jg jk = δi
k , g jsgsk = δk
j. 
Imagine the attached bilinear form with coefﬁcients g Subscript i jgi j, denoted upper S left parenthesis u comma v right parenthesis equals g Subscript i j Baseline u Superscript i Baseline v Superscript jS(u, v) =
gi juiv j. 
This one can have the property upper S left parenthesis u comma u right parenthesis greater than 0 comma for all u not equals 0 comma u equals left parenthesis u Superscript 1 Baseline comma period period period comma u Superscript n Baseline right parenthesisS(u, u) > 0, ∀u /= 0, u = (u1, ..., un). 
In this case, the metric is called a Riemannian metric. 
Otherwise, if there are vectors such that upper S left parenthesis u comma u right parenthesis greater than 0S(u, u) > 0 and other vectors such that 
upper S left parenthesis v comma v right parenthesis less than 0S(v, v) < 0, it is called a non-Riemannian metric; some textbooks use the equivalent 
terminology: semi-Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian. 
The signature of a metric is deﬁned as the signature of the corresponding quadratic 
form. For the Minkowski metric, the signature can beleft parenthesis plus minus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−−) orleft parenthesis minus plus plus plus right parenthesis(−+ ++). Both  
signatures can be used. It is important to mention that if we decide to use a signature, 
the sign which decides the time-like vectors has to be given by the ﬁrst sign in the

Basic Differential Geometry Concepts and Their Applications
signature, i.e. if the signature isleft parenthesis plus minus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−−), the time-like vectors satisfyupper S left parenthesis u comma u right parenthesis greater than 0S(u, u) > 0. 
If the signature is left parenthesis minus plus plus plus right parenthesis(−+ ++) the time-like vectors satisfy upper S left parenthesis u comma u right parenthesis less than 0S(u, u) < 0. 
Some examples: the Euclidean metric d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis d x cubed right parenthesis squaredds2 = (dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 is a 
Riemannian metric. Its signature is left parenthesis plus plus plus right parenthesis(+ + +) while the Minkowski metric d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x cubed right parenthesis squaredds2 =
(dx1)2 −(dx2)2 −(dx3)2 is a non-Riemannian metric with left parenthesis plus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−) signature. 
In a previous example, we saw a Minkowski space endowed with the metric 
d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x cubed right parenthesis squaredds2 = (dx1)2 + (dx2)2 −(dx3)2 whose signature is left parenthesis plus plus minus right parenthesis(+ + −). In four dimensions 
such Minkowski metrics, i.e. with signaturesleft parenthesis plus minus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−−) andleft parenthesis plus plus minus minus right parenthesis(+ + −−), are used to 
describe de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space-times, which are examples of universes 
without matter. In three dimensions, we already saw the time-like Minkowski spheres 
of these spaces. They can be used as models for Non-Euclidean geometries as we 
will see later in this book.

Therefore, a tangent vector to a curve is a contravariant vector.

upper V equals upper V Superscript kV = V k, or only upper V Superscript kV k as we did before. That is, a vector can be seen through its

Basic Differential Geometry Concepts and Their Applications
It is now an exercise for the readers to quickly derive the following formulas 
backslash bUnALT StartLayout 1st Row upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline equals minus upper R Subscript i j l k Baseline semicolon 2nd Row upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline equals minus upper R Subscript j i k l Baseline semicolon 3rd Row upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline equals upper R Subscript k l i j Baseline semicolon 4th Row upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline plus upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline plus upper R Subscript i l j k Baseline equals 0 period EndLayout backslash eUnALT
Ri jkl = −Ri jlk;
Ri jkl = −R jikl;
Ri jkl = Rkli j;
Ri jkl + Riklj + Riljk = 0.
in their intrinsic form. 
The last identity, upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline plus upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline plus upper R Subscript i l j k Baseline equals 0Ri jkl + Riklj + Riljk = 0 is known as Bianchi’s ﬁrst formula 
and will be used to obtain the symmetry of the Ricci tensor. Let us recall that, in the 
case of surfaces when there are only two variablesx Superscript 1x1 andx squaredx2, the symmetry of Ricci 
symbols was obtained using Einstein theorem which states upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals upper K dot g Subscript i jRi j = K · gi j. 
Theorem 5.2.2 The Ricci tensor is symmetric, that is upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals upper R Subscript j i Baseline periodRi j = R ji.
Proof We multiply the Bianchi ﬁrst identity upper R Subscript i j k l Baseline plus upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline plus upper R Subscript i l j k Baseline equals 0Ri jkl + Riklj + Riljk = 0 by g Superscript j lg jl. It  
results 
backslash bUnALT g Superscript l j Baseline upper R Subscript j i l k Baseline plus g Superscript j l Baseline upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline minus g Superscript l j Baseline upper R Subscript j k l i Baseline equals 0 comma backslash eUnALTglj R jilk + g jl Riklj −glj R jkli = 0,
that is 
backslash bUnALT upper R Subscript i l k Superscript l Baseline plus g Superscript j l Baseline upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline minus upper R Subscript k l i Superscript l Baseline equals 0 comma backslash eUnALTRl
ilk + g jl Riklj −Rl
kli = 0,
or simply 
backslash bUnALT upper R Subscript i k Baseline plus g Superscript j l Baseline upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline minus upper R Subscript k i Baseline equals 0 period backslash eUnALTRik + g jl Riklj −Rki = 0.
If we show that g Superscript j l Baseline upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline equals 0g jl Riklj = 0, we complete the proof. This is a consequence of 
backslash bUnALT g Superscript j l Baseline upper R Subscript i k l j Baseline equals g Superscript l j Baseline upper R Subscript i k j l Baseline equals minus g Superscript l j Baseline upper R Subscript i k j l Baseline period backslash eUnALTg jl Riklj = glj Rikjl = −glj Rikjl.

Theorem 5.3.7 If c left parenthesis t right parenthesisc(t) is a geodesic, then StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue ModifyingAbove c With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue||˙c(t)|| is a constant. 
Proof Recall ﬁrst that the length of a vector in a given metric d s squared equals g i j d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript jds2 = gi jdxidx j
obviously depends on the type of the vector. Therefore, in our case, the formula is

The concept of covariant derivative of tensors allows us to obtain the same result 
in the next section. The fact that, along a geodesic, the length of the tangent vector at 
the geodesic is a constant one, allows us to replace the parameter tt with s equals StartFraction t Over StartRoot StartAbsoluteValue b EndAbsoluteValue EndRoot EndFractions =

The geodesic c equals c left parenthesis s right parenthesisc = c(s) has the property StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue ModifyingAbove c With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue equals 1 period||˙c(s)|| = 1.
Deﬁnition 5.3.8 A curve which fulﬁls such a property, i.e. StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue ModifyingAbove c With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue equals 1 comma||˙c(s)|| = 1, is called a 
canonically parameterized curve. 
These last two theorems will be used later to understand how geodesics of the 
disk are transformed by inversion in geodesic of the Poincaré half-plane. And 
more, how geodesics of the disk are transformed by inversion in geodesics outside 
the disk. All these facts will allow us to better understand the connections among 
Non-Euclidean Geometry basic models.

of g Subscript k j Baseline upper V Superscript k Baseline upper W Superscript jgkjV kW j. Applying the product rule for the covariant derivative, we obtain

upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i j Baseline equals k upper T Subscript i jRi j −1
2 R · gi j = kTi j
and they act in a four-dimensional coordinate space left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis period(x0, x1, x2, x3).
We ﬁrst observe that tensors involved in the left-hand side of the equality come 
from our previous Differential Geometry considerations. In the case of surfaces, i.e. 
n equals 2n = 2, the left-hand side gives the so-called Einstein theorem, 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 periodRi j −1
2 R · gi j = 0.
In the right-hand side,kk is a constant andupper T Subscript i jTi j is the so-called stress–energy tensor 
which satisﬁes the condition 
upper T Subscript i j semicolon a Baseline equals 0 commaTi j;a = 0 ,
which is a conservation law. 
But if we can somehow “prove” that upper T Subscript i j semicolon a Baseline equals 0 commaTi j;a = 0, we have to prove that 
left parenthesis upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis Subscript semicolon a Baseline equals 0 period
(
Ri j −1
2 R · gi j
)
;a
= 0.
The null covariant derivative for both tensors is followed by their proportionality 
through the constant kk.

Differential Geometry at Work: Two Ways of Thinking the Gravity …
However, since these tensors have to be well chosen, an analogy can be derived 
from the Newtonian Mechanics. The next chapter will be devoted to the Newtonian 
Mechanics and all the details of the short story we are going to tell here can be seen 
there. The same about the General Relativity aspects presented here: they will be 
discussed later in this book. Now we want to highlight how we can move from the 
Foundations of Geometry, through Differential Geometry, to General Relativity. This 
fact is almost amazing. 
6.1 
From Newtonian Gravity to the Geometry 
of Space-Time 
General relativity is a theory describing gravity. Gravity was ﬁrst described as a 
force in the framework of Newtonian Mechanics, so our short story passes through 
the deﬁnition offered by Isaac Newton. If the masses upper M 1M1 and mm are concentrated at 
the points left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 comma z 1 right parenthesis(x1, y1, z1), left parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesis(x, y, z), respectively, the gravitational force induced by the 
body of mass upper M 1M1 which acts on the body of mass m comma upper M 1 greater than mm, M1 > m has the intensity 
upper F equals upper G StartFraction m upper M 1 Over r 1 squared EndFraction commaF = G mM1

is the distance between the two bodies and upper G equals 6.67 dot 10 Superscript negative 11G = 6.67 · 10−11 is the gravitational 
constant measured in the well-known SI units for length, mass, and time, i.e. left parenthesis m right parenthesis cubed dot left parenthesis k g right parenthesis Superscript negative 1 Baseline left parenthesis s right parenthesis Superscript negative 2(m)3 ·

The gravitational force vector has the form 
ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals minus StartFraction upper G m upper M 1 Over r 1 squared EndFraction StartFraction ModifyingAbove r With right arrow Subscript 1 Baseline Over r 1 EndFraction equals minus StartFraction upper G m upper M 1 Over r 1 squared EndFraction dot left parenthesis StartFraction x minus x 1 Over r 1 EndFraction comma StartFraction y minus y 1 Over r 1 EndFraction comma StartFraction z minus z 1 Over r 1 EndFraction right parenthesis period

If we denote the unit vector in the brackets by minus ModifyingAbove u With right arrow−

ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals m StartFraction upper G upper M 1 Over r 1 squared EndFraction ModifyingAbove u With right arrow period

Later, in this book, the reader will ﬁnd a chapter devoted to basic Newtonian Mechan-
ics principles and consequences. According to the Second Principle of Newtonian 
Mechanics, the above formula can be written in the form

is the gravitational acceleration or the gravitational ﬁeld induced by the body of 
mass upper M 1M1. 
The last formula can be seen in coordinates as

This deﬁnition makes sense at all points of the Euclidean three-dimensional space 
except left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 comma z 1 right parenthesis(x1, y1, z1) where the gravitational source is located. 
The following mathematical facts can be proven in the case of a Universe in which 
only a mass exists:

masses considered. Therefore, if the Universe contains only the masses upper M Subscript k Baseline comma k element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma period period period comma upper N EndSetMk, k ∈

and these are not simple. A complete proof can be seen in [ 34, 46]. 
Let us consider again a Universe "with only one mass upper M 1M1. This time we are not 
interested to add more masses to the system, therefore this mass attached to the point 
left parenthesis x 1 comma y 1 comma z 1 right parenthesis(x1, y1, z1) will be denoted by upper MM. All the formulas written in the case of the index

The tidal vector measures the variation of nearby trajectories and the above result is 
a very geometric one, because it is related to the trajectories of a free-falling system 
of particles in a gravitational ﬁeld generated by a mass. 
The reader has to notice: all above results are obtained in the Euclidean space, 
therefore the Christoffel symbols normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript iTi
jk are all null. Why are we telling this fact?

and the Energy–Momentum Tensor 
Let us think how the equations of the tidal acceleration looks like in a four-

In such a space, the Christoffel symbols normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript iTi
jk are not necessarily null. In the 
same way as in the Euclidean case, we consider that each coordinate depends on 
two parameters denoted left parenthesis tau comma q right parenthesis(τ, q), therefore each point of the space-time has the form 
left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline left parenthesis tau comma q right parenthesis comma x Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis tau comma q right parenthesis comma x squared left parenthesis tau comma q right parenthesis comma x cubed left parenthesis tau comma q right parenthesis right parenthesis period(x0(τ, q), x1(τ, q), x2(τ, q), x3(τ, q)).

The change of paradigm is related to the equations of tidal acceleration, the 
geometric tidal acceleration, and the conclusion drawn above. 
In order to achieve the last equality, we need to construct the correct framework. 
We follow the line sketched in [ 34]. 
Let us start from a symmetric contravariant tensor left parenthesis upper T Superscript i j Baseline right parenthesis(T i j), expressed as a 4 times 44 ×
4 matrix and consider a four-dimensional space of coordinates left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x0, x1, x2, x3)

columns. 
Before discussing about the physical aspects involved in the components of the 
energy–momentum tensor, let us assert that we can analyse the tensor like we analyse 
a vector upper FF used to represent the ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid. 
We can suppose the existence of a ﬂow associated to the above tensor. For each line 
of the given tensor we have the corresponding forceupper T Superscript kT k described above. We can also 
think about a44-parallelepiped centred at a given pointleft parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x0, x1, x2, x3) with sides par-

Differential Geometry at Work: Two Ways of Thinking the Gravity …
Small enough to let us suppose the vector upper T Superscript kT k having the same components at each 
point of considered face. 
The total outﬂow determined by eachupper T Superscript kT k through the parallel faces, corresponding 
to x Superscript ixi direction, is analysed in the following way. 
If i equals 1i = 1, we have the differences 
upper T Superscript k Baseline 1 Baseline left parenthesis x 0 comma x 1 plus StartFraction Delta x 1 Over 2 EndFraction comma x 2 comma x 3 right parenthesis Delta x 0 Delta x 2 Delta x 3 minus upper T Superscript k Baseline 1 Baseline left parenthesis x 0 comma x 1 minus StartFraction Delta x 1 Over 2 EndFraction comma x 2 comma x 3 right parenthesis Delta x 0 Delta x 2 Delta x 3 commaT k1

;l /x0/x1/x2/x3.
What is happening in the interior of this small 4-parallelepiped? The quantity of 
matter and energy which enters in the interior of the given 4-parallelepiped leaves 
completely the interior. Therefore, at each moment of time, the quantity of matter 
inside can be considered a constant. The energy–momentum tensor is conserved, 
and since it is conserved as Delta x Superscript k Baseline right arrow 0 comma/xk →0, the limiting net ﬂow approaches to 00, that is, 
upper T Subscript semicolon l Superscript k l Baseline equals 0T kl
;l = 0. 
Let us underline the fact that this is a sort of axiom. We suppose that the matter 
does not disappear and does not appear from nowhere inside the parallelepiped, 
and we are talking here about the matter and energy seen as an incompressible ﬂuid 
described by the tensor. This “axiom” is in fact the key of the fact that these equations 
never match in a quantum mechanics context. 
We know how to lower indexes using the metric tensor: upper T Subscript i Superscript l Baseline equals g Subscript i k Baseline upper T Superscript k lT l
i = gikT kl. Since the 
covariant derivative of the metric tensor is 00, it is  
upper T Subscript i semicolon l Superscript l Baseline equals g Subscript i k semicolon l Baseline upper T Superscript k l Baseline plus g Subscript i k Baseline upper T Subscript semicolon l Superscript k l Baseline equals 0 periodT l
i;l = gik;lT kl + gikT kl

Lowering again the indexes, it is upper T Subscript j i Baseline equals g Subscript j l Baseline upper T Subscript i Superscript lTji = g jlT l

i;l = 0.
We have proved an important property of the energy–momentum tensor, i.e. 
upper T Subscript i j semicolon l Baseline equals 0 commaTi j;l = 0 ,
which is a conservation law. 
Therefore, to obtain the previous equality, we have to prove that the so-called 
Einstein tensor upper E Subscript i j Baseline colon equals upper R Subscript i j minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i jEi j := Ri j −1
2 R · gi j has the property 
upper E Subscript i j semicolon a Baseline equals 0 periodEi j;a = 0.
This is the aim of the next theorem. Before proving it, the following comment is 
necessary. upper E Subscript i j semicolon a Baseline equals 0Ei j;a = 0 holds also if dimensions are different from four. 
Theorem 6.2.1 (Covariant derivative of Einstein tensor) If g Subscript i jgi j is the left parenthesis 0 comma 2 right parenthesis(0, 2) metric 
tensor, g Superscript i jgi j its inverse contravariant left parenthesis 2 comma 0 right parenthesis(2, 0) tensor, upper R Subscript i jRi j is the Ricci tensor, upper R colon equals upper R Subscript s Superscript sR := Rs

possible to deﬁne the Einstein tensor 
upper E Subscript i j Baseline colon equals upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i j Baseline periodEi j := Ri j −1
2 R · gi j .
Then 
upper E Subscript i j semicolon a Baseline equals 0 periodEi j;a = 0.
Proof First of all, let us observe that upper RR can be written as g Superscript i j Baseline upper R Subscript i jgi j Ri j. Indeed, 
g Superscript i j Baseline upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals g Superscript i j Baseline upper R Subscript j i Baseline equals upper R Subscript i Superscript i Baseline equals upper R periodgi j Ri j = gi j R ji = Ri

This form is useful when we are considering a Universe described by the condition 
upper T Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ti j = 0. For such Universes upper T equals 0T = 0, too. Therefore their equations are 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 periodRi j = 0.
If we are looking at the Einstein ﬁeld equations 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R dot g Subscript i j Baseline equals k upper T Subscript i j Baseline commaRi j −1
2 R · gi j = kTi j,
in the left-hand side, we see the geometry of the space expressed in terms of tensors; 
in the right-hand side, there is a tensor describing mass and energy. The equality 
shows that the mass and energy together create the geometric structure of the space-
time. Therefore, the geodesics of the space-time, i.e. the curves followed by “material 
points” under the action of the geometry itself, depends on the geometry created by 
the matter–energy tensor upper T Subscript i jTi j. 
John Archibald Wheeler gave the most impressive description of the facts 
explained above: 
Space-time tells matter how to move; matter tells space-time how to curve.

Geometric Models from Geometry

Measure what can be measured, and make

We are ready to present the two big pictures of non-Euclidean geometry models. The 
ﬁrst one is the consequence of Euclidean 3 upper D3D structure. The second one is revealed 
by Physics. 
7.1 
Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Elliptic Geometric 
Models from Geometry 
We have already seen models of Euclidean geometry. In the case of planez equals 0z = 0, the  
metric 
d s squared equals d x squared plus d y squared plus d z squaredds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2
induces directly the metric 
d s squared equals d x squared plus d y squaredds2 = dx2 + dy2
with null Gaussian curvature and straight lines as geodesics. The parallel transport 
is exactly the one which makes the lines to have the same slope in a system of 
coordinate left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis(x, y). Therefore, for a line dd and a point upper AA not belonging to dd, there is 
only a parallel line through upper AA to dd. This one is the geodesic through upper AA having the 
slope mm. 
Having in mind this model of Euclidean geometry, which may be called the 
classical one, we can transfer it on a sphere using the stereographic projection. We 
did it in Sect. 1.151.15 when we obtained the metric with null Gaussian curvature

We have explained there how the geodesics look like and how the parallel lines look 
like. We can transfer the Euclidean metric in the same way on a different surface. 
In all these models, through a point upper A not an element of dA /∈d, there is only a parallel line to the given 
straight line dd. We have to consider that straight line means geodesic. In the same 
way, all geodesics of the basic Euclidean model are transferred into geodesics in 
models derived after appropriate changes of coordinates. 
Similarly, we studied how the metric 
d s squared equals d x squared plus d y squared plus d z squaredds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2
is transferred on a sphere. The metric we obtained, 
d s squared equals upper R squared d u squared plus upper R squared sine squared u d v squared commads2 = R2du2 + R2 sin2 u dv2,
has constant positive Gaussian curvature,upper K equals StartFraction 1 Over upper R squared EndFractionK = 1
R2 . Geodesics of this metric are great 
circles; therefore, two geodesics intersect in two antipodal points. Denoting the two 
geodesics by c 1c1 and c 2c2 and 
StartSet upper A comma upper B EndSet colon equals c 1 intersection c 2 comma{A, B} := c1 ∩c2,
upper A comma upper BA, B and the centre of the sphere are collinear points. Therefore, in this elliptic 
geometry of the sphere, there are no parallel lines. 
So, until now we saw only geometries in which there exists only one parallel line 
or no parallel lines. Not entering in technical details, let us call non-secant lines two 
lines which do not intersect. 
Are there geometries in which through upper A not an element of dA /∈d we can construct more than one 
non-secant line to dd? Again, do not forget the meaning of line, i.e. a geodesic. The 
answer is yes, but we need some steps to describe it. 
Step 1. Example 1.3.3 was related to the existence of a surface obtained by the 
rotation of a tractrix around an axis. The 3D metric 
d s squared equals d x squared plus d y squared plus d z squaredds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2
acts on the parameterization of the pseudosphere producing the metric 
d s squared equals cotangent squared u d u squared plus sine squared u d v squared commads2 = cot2 u du2 + sin2 u dv2,
where u element of left parenthesis 0 comma StartFraction pi Over 2 EndFraction right parenthesis comma v element of left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesisu ∈(0, π

Step 2. In Example 4.10 .44.10.4, we determined its Gaussian constant curvature, upper K equals negative 1 periodK =
−1.

Step 3. In Example4.13 .24.13.2, we have transferred the metric of the pseudosphere to 
the “half-plane” 
upper H squared colon equals left brace left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis vertical bar x comma y element of double struck upper R comma y greater than 0 right braceH 2 := {(x, y)|x, y ∈R, y > 0}

The metric of half-plane becomes

y2
and its Gaussian curvature is upper K equals negative 1K = −1. 
The half-planeupper H squaredH 2 endowed with the previous metric is called Poincaré half-plane 
and it is involved in the description of a non-Euclidean geometry model, in which, 
through upper A not an element of dA /∈d pass more than two non-secant lines to given line dd. We show this 
below. 
Finally, it remains something obvious: using the inverse transform of coordinates, 
the pseudosphere will be the surface involved in the description of non-Euclidean 
geometry. 
So, let us study the geodesics of the metric

Let us observe that

where aa is a constant. It is a solution of the previous equations. 
This ﬁrst solution satisﬁes the equation 
left parenthesis x minus a right parenthesis squared plus y squared equals upper R squared period(x −a)2 + y2 = R2.
This is, from the Euclidean point of view, the equation of a semicircle in the Poincaré 
half-plane. So, we draw the semicircle, but this is a geodesic, a straight line in the 
Poincaré half-plane. Another simple computation shows that x equals x left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals a semicolon y equals y left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals e Superscript sx = x(s) = a; y =
y(s) = es satisfy the equations of geodesics. 
From the Euclidean point of view, this is the parameterization of straight line 
perpendicular toy equals 0y = 0. In fact, this geodesic is a straight line in Poincaré half-plane, 
too (Fig. 7.1). Now, it is only an exercise for the reader to write the equations of the 
geodesics of the pseudosphere. 
Consider two semicircles, d 1d1 and d 2d2 which intersect at a point denoted upper AA. Let  
us consider a bigger semicircle, dd, such that d 1d1 and d 2d2 are drawn in its interior. 
Therefore, we are considering two geodesic lines through upper AA non-secant to dd. The  
Poincaré half-plane becomes a model of non-Euclidean geometry. Transferring this 
ﬁgure on pseudosphere, we give rise there to a model of non-Euclidean geometry. It 
is a simple exercise for the reader imagining a ﬁgure with a linedd and two non-secant 
lines through upper AA, one having the equation x equals ax = a. 
Some remarks are now necessary. In the two-dimensional Euclidean planeupper E squaredE2, let  
us consider the unit circle with the centre at upper M left parenthesis 0 comma negative 1 right parenthesis periodM(0, −1). Denote by upper A left parenthesis 0 comma negative 2 right parenthesisA(0, −2) a point 
which belongs to the circle, upper B left parenthesis upper X comma upper Y right parenthesisB(X, Y) in the interior of the circle and upper B prime left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesisB'(x, y) in the 
superior half-plane such that upper A comma upper B comma upper B primeA, B, B' are collinear and upper A upper B dot upper A upper B Superscript prime Baseline equals 4AB · AB' = 4. Using  the  
previous two conditions, we can compute the coordinatesxx andyy with respect to the 
coordinates left parenthesis upper X comma upper Y right parenthesis(X, Y):

is transferred inside the unit circle centred at upper MM as

If we translate the disc such asupper M left parenthesis 0 comma negative 1 right parenthesisM(0, −1) becomes upper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0), the metric of the disc is

4
(1 −X2 −Y 2)2 (d X2 + dY 2).
The unit disc endowed with this metric is called the Poincaré disc. The Gaussian 
curvature of the metric is upper K equals negative 1K = −1 and the geodesics of the disc are obtained trans-
ferring the geodesics of the half-plane inside the disc through the transformation of 
coordinates described above. Since the transformation is a geometric inversion (see 
[ 34]), we obtain two types of geodesics. Diameters of the Poincaré disc and arcs of 
circles inside the disc which are orthogonal to the circumference of the unit disc. 
Transforming a conﬁguration like in Figure 2.12.1, we can see a non-Euclidean model 
of the geometry inside the Poincaré disc. 
7.2 
Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Elliptic Geometric 
Models from Physics 
Let us prove that the metric 
d s squared equals minus d upper T squared plus d upper X squared plus d upper Y squared plus d upper Z squaredds2 = −dT 2 + d X2 + dY 2 + dZ2
is related to Physics. 
This is the Minkowskileft parenthesis minus plus plus plus right parenthesis(−+ ++) metric of Special Relativity in geometric coor-
dinates, that is when the speed of light is calibrated at c equals 1c = 1. It comes from the 
quadratic form left angle bracket upper U comma upper U right angle bracket<U,U> attached to the Minkowski product

In order to explain quickly why this metric is related to Special Relativity, let us 
consider only two coordinates upper TT and upper XX and a Lorentz transformation described as 
upper T left parenthesis t comma x right parenthesis equals StartFraction t plus x v Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction semicolon upper X left parenthesis t comma x right parenthesis equals StartFraction t v plus x Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction periodT (t, x) = t + x v
√
1 −v2 ; X(t, x) = t v + x
√

As we know, this Lorentz transformation describes how the coordinates left parenthesis t comma x right parenthesis(t, x) of 
a frame which moves at constant speed vv are seen in a frame at rest in coordinates 
left parenthesis upper T comma upper X right parenthesis(T, X). The Lorentz transformation implies the invariance of the quantityminus upper T squared plus upper X squared−T 2 + X2
because 
minus upper T squared plus upper X squared equals minus left parenthesis StartFraction t plus x v Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis StartFraction t v plus x Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction right parenthesis squared equals minus t squared plus x squared period −T 2 + X2 = −

Since this quantity depends on the Minkowski product 
left angle bracket upper U comma upper U right angle bracket equals minus left parenthesis upper U Subscript upper T Baseline right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis upper U Subscript upper X Baseline right parenthesis squared<U,U> = −(UT )2 + (UX)2
it results that Lorentz transformations preserve the square of the Minkowski norm 
of vectors. The metric highlights this geometric aspect. In fact, if v equals hyperbolic tangent alphav = tanh α, the  
Lorentz transformation is a hyperbolic rotation of coordinates. All these facts will 
be completely explained and understood later in the chapter dedicated to Special 
Relativity. 
Returning to geometric models, let us ﬁx the time. At upper T equals upper T 0T = T0, the space–time 
metric becomes 
d s squared equals d upper X squared plus d upper Y squared plus d upper Z squaredds2 = d X2 + dY 2 + dZ2
which is an Euclidean one. 
This metric allows to obtain both the elliptic and the Euclidean geometries as we 
have in the ﬁrst part of this section. 
When we will discuss non-Euclidean models, a slice through a Minkowski sphere 
is involved. The sphere is related to the condition 
minus upper T squared plus upper X squared plus upper Y squared plus upper Z squared equals negative 1 −T 2 + X2 + Y 2 + Z2 = −1
and the slice will be described by the condition upper Z equals 0Z = 0. 
Let us ﬁrst understand why the unit space-like sphere 
minus upper T squared plus upper X squared plus upper Y squared plus upper Z squared equals negative 1 −T 2 + X2 + Y 2 + Z2 = −1
is important.

We face a remarkable physics structure, a space-like unit sphere which is in fact 
a 3 upper D3D Universe without matter called Anti-de Sitter space–time. 
Let us now consider the 3 upper D3D slice when upper Z equals 0Z = 0. This slice has the Minkowski

The Physical Interpretation 
At the internet address https://archive.org/details/lascienceetlhypo00poin, it can be 
found the Poincaré famous bookupper S c i e n c e e t upper H y p o t h ModifyingAbove e With grave s eScience et Hypoth `ese [161]. Pages 83–87 offer a 
beautiful physical example of the Universe related to the non-Euclidean geometry in 
the disc model. The example is given in the interior of a sphere. Let us consider the 
interior of a sphere upper S left parenthesis upper O comma 1 right parenthesisS(O, 1) where upper OO is the centre and 11 is the radius. This interior 
is the Universe for some intelligent inhabitants. 
According to Poincaré, who conceived this particular Universe, both the Euclidean 
geometry and a temperature law are acting in the interior of the sphere. 
The temperature is maximum at the centre and decreases to 00 on the surface of 
the sphere in which this Universe is included. The law of temperature variation is: 
if upper MM is a point such that upper O upper M equals rOM = r then, the temperature at upper MM is proportional to 
1 minus r squared1 −r2. Poincaré allows the temperature to contract or to dilate the length of the 
creatures according to their position after a rule he describes as the length of a ruler 
is proportional to its absolute temperature. So, a ruler having a side inupper OO and the other 
side in upper MM, such that the Euclidean length is StartAbsoluteValue upper O upper M EndAbsoluteValue equals r|OM| = r, has a length proportional to 
1 minus r squared1 −r2. 
The last Poincaré axiom is about how light travels in this Universe: the index of 
refraction of this Universe is inversely proportional to 1 minus r squared1 −r2. We can suppose it as 
StartFraction 4 Over 1 minus r squared EndFraction
4
1 −r2 . 
Having all these facts in mind, let us understand how the inhabitants will perceive 
their Universe. First of all, it is enough to understand the geometry of a disc containing 
the centre of the sphere. For Poincaré, this disc is Euclidean and it has the form of an 
open radius11-disc. For the inhabitants, their length is smaller and smaller when they 
try to reach the border of this slice of Universe. They become shorter and shorter, their 
legs become shorter, and their steps become shorter. These things happen because
7.3 The Physical Interpretation
167
the temperature acts by contracting the dimensions when they step to the border. The 
ﬁnite Euclidean Universe for Poincaré seems to be inﬁnite for the small creatures. 
The rule established by Poicaré for distance will be understood by the inhabitants as 
d Superscript n Baseline left parenthesis upper O comma upper M right parenthesis equals one half dot ln StartFraction 1 minus x Over 1 minus 0 EndFraction colon StartFraction negative 1 minus x Over negative 1 minus 0 EndFraction commadn(O, M) = 1
2 · ln 1 −x
1 −0 : −1 −x
−1 −0 ,
that is, when xx approaches 11, d Superscript ndn approaches inﬁnity. Of course, here upper O upper MOM is the 
xx-axis. One inhabitant, mister quotation mark upper H quotation mark“upper HHquotation mark upper H quotation mark, will observe that it is possible to describe this 
distance for two arbitrary points upper A comma upper BA, B in the form 
d Superscript n Baseline left parenthesis upper A comma upper B right parenthesis colon equals ln StartFraction max Underscript upper P element of upper K Endscripts g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis Over min Underscript upper P element of upper K Endscripts g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis EndFraction comma g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper A EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper B EndAbsoluteValue EndFractiondn(A, B) := ln maxP∈K gAB(P)
minP∈K gAB(P) , gAB = |P A|
|P B|
where upper KK is the boundary, that is the circle of radius 11, and StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper A EndAbsoluteValue|P A| is the Euclidean 
distance between upper PP in upper KK and upper AA in the interior of the disc. 
The intelligent inhabitants will understand that light is moving on the “straight 
lines” of the Geometry of their Universe. Since the law of light propagation depends 
on the index of refraction, they will deduce the metric of their Universe as 
d s squared equals StartFraction 4 Over left parenthesis 1 minus left parenthesis x squared plus y squared right parenthesis right parenthesis squared EndFraction left parenthesis d x squared plus d y squared right parenthesis periodds2 =
4
(1 −(x2 + y2))2 (dx2 + dy2).
The straight lines (the geodesics), induced by the trajectories of ray lights, are diam-
eters or arcs of circles bi-orthogonal to the border as we explained above. 
There are two “parallel lines” to a given “line” through a given point. The sum of 
angles of a “triangle” is less than two right angles. Now they conclude they live in a 
non-Euclidean Universe. 
Finally, the inhabitants have two ideas about their slice of the Universe, ideas 
which can be extended to the entire interior of the sphere: 
(i) the Universe is inﬁnite 
(ii) the Universe is governed by the laws of non-Euclidean geometry and is curved. 
In each slice, the Gaussian curvature is a negative constant, upper K left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis equals negative 1K(x, y) = −1. 
But this is not true, their Universe is a ﬁnite interior of aupper RR-sphere and the under-
lying geometry is Euclidean, not hyperbolic! 
Poincaré established that the inhabitants of his physical model are perfectly right 
to use hyperbolic geometry as the foundation of their Physics because it is convenient, 
but there is a non-sense to speak about the philosophical abstract truth or about an 
approximation of any truth, because intelligent inhabitants point of view is in collision 
with the way and laws their Universe was established.

Differential Geometry at Work: Euclidean, Non-Euclidean …
Poincaré opinion is that the reality is not described by the most “realistic” Geom-
etry “la géométrie la plus vrai”, but by the most comfortable for the description of 
physical laws (la géométrie la plus commode). Therefore, Poincaré believed that the 
Geometry of physical space is a conventional one.

Another Way to Obtain the Poincaré Disc Model Metric 
The next theorem allows us to provide the Poincaré disc metric starting from the 
distance naturally related, in Chapter 33, to the Poincaré disc model. The theorem 
allows to obtain the metric of all non-Euclidean geometry models which come from 
the metrization procedure described in its statement. He was formulated by Dan 
Barbilian who is known for the generalizations of Poincaré work in the so-called 
Barbilian spaces (see [ 35, 38].) 
Theorem 7.4.1 (Barbilian’s Theorem) Letupper KK andupper JJ be two subsets of the Euclidean 
plane double struck upper R squared commaR2, and upper K equals partial differential upper J periodK = ∂J. Consider the function f left parenthesis upper M comma upper A right parenthesis equals StartAbsoluteValue upper M upper A EndAbsoluteValue comma f (M, A) = |M A|, where, by StartAbsoluteValue upper M upper A EndAbsoluteValue|M A|, 
we denote the Euclidean distance. Consider 
g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis equals StartFraction f left parenthesis upper M comma upper A right parenthesis Over f left parenthesis upper M comma upper B right parenthesis EndFraction equals StartFraction StartAbsoluteValue upper M upper A EndAbsoluteValue Over StartAbsoluteValue upper M upper B EndAbsoluteValue EndFraction commagAB(M) = f (M, A)
f (M, B) = |M A|
|M B| ,
and consider the semi-distance induced on upper JJ by the metrization procedure, 
d left parenthesis upper A comma upper B right parenthesis colon equals ln StartFraction max Underscript upper P element of upper K Endscripts g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis Over min Underscript upper P element of upper K Endscripts g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper P right parenthesis EndFraction periodd(A, B) := ln maxP∈K gAB(P)
minP∈K gAB(P) .
Suppose furthermore that, for upper M element of upper KM ∈K, the extrema max g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesismax gAB(M) and min g Subscript upper A upper B Baseline left parenthesis upper M right parenthesismin gAB(M)
for any upper AA and upper BB in upper JJ are reached each for a single point in upper K periodK. Then: 
(i) For anyupper A element of upper JA ∈J and any linedd passing throughupper AA, there exist exactly two circles 
tangent to upper KK and also to dd at upper A periodA.
(ii) The metric induced by the previous distance has the form 
d s squared equals one fourth left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over upper R 1 EndFraction plus StartFraction 1 Over r 1 EndFraction right parenthesis squared left parenthesis d x 1 squared plus d x 2 squared right parenthesis commads2 = 1

Gravity in Newtonian Mechanics 
Per Aspera ad Astra. 
Newtonian mechanics is a branch of Physics which studies the way in which the 
bodies are changing in time their position in space. The space in which the objects 
are at rest (or they change their position) is the Euclidean three-dimensional space 
upper E cubedE3. All objects, regardless of size, can be identiﬁed as points with a given mass 
in the previous space. So, the Euclidean frame of coordinates upper O x y zOxyz becomes the 
absolute place where all is happening. Newtonian Mechanics accepts an universal 
time in which all changes in position take place. Forces are seen as vectors. For a 
given point upper MM in space, the vector ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow equals ModifyingAbove upper O upper M With long right arrow
→
X=
−→
OM is called a position vector. If the point 
evolves in time, we write this as 
ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma y left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma z left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis period
→
X (t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)).
The velocity vector is 
ModifyingAbove Above ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow With dot equals left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove y With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove z With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis ˙→
X = (˙x(t), ˙y(t), ˙z(t))
and the acceleration vector is 
ModifyingAbove upper X With right arrow With two dots equals left parenthesis x With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma y With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma z With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis period ¨→
X = (¨x(t), ¨y(t), ¨z(t)).
Of course, we make the assumption that the coordinate functions are indeﬁnitely 
differentiable on their domain of deﬁnition which differs from a model to another. 
The foundations of Newtonian Mechanics are based on three fundamental princi-
ples, the so-called Newton’s laws of motion. They were introduced by Isaac New-
ton in “Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica”, book published in 1687.

Gravity in Newtonian Mechanics
The Principle of Inertia, or the ﬁrst law, asserts: “A physical body preserves its state 
of rest or will continue moving at its current velocity conserving its direction, until 
a force causes a change in its state of moving or rest. The physical body will change 
the velocity and the direction according to this force”. A particular case is related to 
the rectilinear uniform motion, when the body is moving on a straight line at constant 
speed. The frames where this principle is available are called inertial frames. These 
frames are at rest or they move rectilinear at constant speed. This fundamental prin-
ciple was ﬁrst enunciated by Galilei. We can say that this principle tells us where, 
according to Newton, the two other fundamental principles make sense: in inertial 
frames. In the same time, it tells us that it is impossible to make a distinction between 
the state “at rest” and the state “rectilinear motion at constant speed”. Imagine you 
are in the bowl of a ship and you have no possibility to observe outside. You slept and 
you waked up. You cannot distinguish between the two states without an observation, 
a possible comparison. You will play table tennis alike in both states, the object falls 
down in the same way in both states, etc. The two states are equivalent for you in 
the given conditions. Newton introduces a concept, the quantity of motion of a body 
as the product between the mass mm and its velocity ModifyingAbove v With right arrow
→v . This quantity of motion is 
known today as momentum and it is denoted byModifyingAbove p With right arrow
→p, thereforeModifyingAbove p With right arrow colon equals m ModifyingAbove v With right arrow
→p:= m
→v . The second 
law asserts: “The force who acts on a body is the variation in time of the quantity of 
motion”. Its differential form is ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals StartFraction d ModifyingAbove p With right arrow Over d t EndFraction

F= d

ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals StartFraction d ModifyingAbove p With right arrow Over d t EndFraction equals m StartFraction d ModifyingAbove v With right arrow Over d t EndFraction equals m ModifyingAbove a With right arrow comma

that is the force which acts on a body is proportional to the body acceleration through 
its mass. Newton’s third law: “When a body acts on a second body by the force ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow

F, 
the second body simultaneously reacts on the ﬁrst body by the force minus ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow−

F.” 
This chapter is devoted to gravity. We try to outline the basic facts about gravity, 
we prove the vacuum ﬁeld equation and the general gravitational ﬁeld equation. The 
artefact we use to express these laws is the gravitational potential. Later, in the chapter 
devoted to general relativity, the same gravitational potential is involved, in general, in 
metric components, and, speciﬁcally, in the coefﬁcients of the Schwarzschild metric. 
The step towards general relativity is made when the tidal acceleration equations 
are written in a geometric form corresponding to a space endowed with a metric. 
However, our journey to relativity has to wait because we need some other tools until 
the moment we derive Einstein’s ﬁeld equations via the Einstein–Hilbert action. 
We study Lagrangians and metrics induced by Lagrangians, where Euler–Lagrange 
equations become the geodesic equations of these metrics. Finally, we will connect 
these results to non-Euclidean geometry models. Kepler’s laws are derived. Later, in 
the same general relativity chapter, we understand how the conic curve, found as the 
trajectory of a planet, is still the geodesic trajectory approximation of the same planet 
in a given metric. An excellent discussion on Newtonian mechanics, in gravitational 
perspective, can be found in the book [ 66].

Gravity. The Vacuum Field Equation

understand it from the classical mechanics point of view.

Newton stated that the gravitational force induced by the body of mass upper MM
which acts on the body of mass mm has the intensity upper F equals upper G StartFraction m upper M Over r squared EndFractionF = G mM

Before continuing, let us write the previous formula in the form 
ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals m StartFraction upper G upper M Over r squared EndFraction ModifyingAbove u With right arrow comma
→
F= m GM
r2
→u ,
whereModifyingAbove u With right arrow
→u is a unitary vector. The massmm of the body gravitationally attracted seems to 
be like a “gravitational charge”, if we compareupper F equals upper G StartFraction m upper M Over r squared EndFractionF = G mM
r2
with the similar formula 
which describes the intensity of an electric force, upper F equals k StartFraction q 1 q 2 Over r squared EndFractionF = k q1q2
r2 . Therefore we can 
think at mm to be a gravitational mass denoted by m Subscript gmg.
176

Gravity in Newtonian Mechanics
In the special case, when we consider a body gravitational attracted by the Earth, 
upper MM is the mass of the Earth, rr is the radius of the Earth and upper GG the gravitational 
constant, it results 
upper F equals m Subscript g Baseline dot upper A commaF = mg · A,
where upper A equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over r squared EndFractionA = GM
r2
is a constant acceleration denoted by gg, where g equals 9.81 StartFraction left parenthesis m right parenthesis Over left parenthesis s right parenthesis squared EndFraction periodg = 9.81 (m)
(s)2 .
In Newton’s second law of motion, the massmm seems to be a constant which makes 
possible to compare the intensity of the force and the magnitude of acceleration, 
upper F equals m aF = ma. This is an  inertial mass, denoted by m Subscript imi, because the ﬁrst Newton’s law 
establishes the frames where the all three laws are true: the inertial frames. Therefore 
upper F equals m Subscript i Baseline aF = mia. In the case when upper FF is the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on the 
body of mass m Subscript imi, upper F equals m Subscript i Baseline gF = mig. It results  
StartFraction m Subscript g Baseline Over m Subscript i Baseline EndFraction equals StartFraction g r squared Over upper G upper M EndFraction equals k periodmg
mi
= gr2
GM = k.
The constant kk is not equal to 11 by deﬁnition, but, if we measure the weight, the 
space and the time with some other scaled units, the ratio StartFraction m Subscript g Baseline Over m Subscript i Baseline EndFractionmg
mi
results 11. 
So we can accept that the gravitational mass is the same as the inertial mass, and we 
can denote bymm the valuem Subscript g Baseline equals m Subscript img = mi. This is the equivalence principle as formulated 
by Galileo 1. We will see that it assumes a fundamental role in the formulation of 
general relativity. 
Let us return to the formula 
ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals m StartFraction upper G upper M Over r squared EndFraction ModifyingAbove u With right arrow

F= m GM
r2
→u
seen as ModifyingAbove upper F With right arrow equals m ModifyingAbove upper A With right arrow period

ModifyingAbove upper A With right arrow equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over r squared EndFraction ModifyingAbove u With right arrow period
→
A= GM
r2
→u .
This gravitational acceleration is also called a gravitational ﬁeld induced by the body 
of mass upper MM. This deﬁnition suggests how the gravity acts. In coordinates we have 
ModifyingAbove upper A With right arrow equals minus StartFraction upper G upper M Over r squared EndFraction left parenthesis StartFraction x minus x 1 Over r EndFraction comma StartFraction y minus y 1 Over r EndFraction comma StartFraction z minus z 1 Over r EndFraction right parenthesis period

force involving electric chargesqq, it ism Subscript i Baseline not equals qmi /= q. This means that equivalence principle is proper of 
gravity.

How this discussion changes if we are talking about an incompressible ﬂuid in a

we consider the difference

and it makes sense for all left parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesis(x, y, z) of the space. 
Now suppose that in a bounded region upper DD of the Euclidean space upper E cubedE3 there is a 
continuous distribution of matter and point sources. This continuous distribution of

(m)3 . Outsideupper DD
we have rho identical to 0ρ ≡0. 
How it looks like the gravitational ﬁeld equation in this case? Let us prove the 
following. 
Theorem 8.4.1 (General Gravitational Field Equation) Ifupper DD is a region of the space 
where it exists a continuous distribution of matter deﬁned by the density function rhoρ, 
then 
white down pointing triangle Superscript 2 Baseline upper Phi left parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesis equals 4 pi upper G rho left parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesisV2Φ(x, y, z) = 4πGρ(x, y, z)
everywhere in upper DD. 
Proof Outside upper DD, where rho equals 0ρ = 0, the theorem reduces to the vacuum ﬁeld equation. 
It remains to prove the statement for all the points of upper DD. We cover upper DD with paral-
lelepipeds. To do this, we consider points on upper O xOx-axis and parallel planes to y upper O zyOz
through these points. In the same way, we take into account parallel planes to x upper O zx Oz
through points on upper O yOy and parallel planes to x upper O yx Oy through points on upper O zOz. We obtain 
parallelepipeds with the faces parallel to the planes determined by the axes of coordi-
nates. Some of parallelepipeds are completely insideupper DD, some are completely outside 
upper DD and some of them contain parts inside and outside. 
Now we can index the points and we can denote the centres of parallelepipeds 
which cover upper DD as being left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline comma y Subscript j Baseline comma z Subscript k Baseline right parenthesis(xi, y j, zk) and the corresponding dimensions of sides as 
Delta x Subscript i Baseline comma Delta y Subscript j Baseline comma Delta z Subscript k Baseline/xi, /y j, /zk. 
We can suppose the mass of such parallelepiped is rho left parenthesis x Subscript i Baseline comma y Subscript j Baseline comma z Subscript k Baseline right parenthesis Delta x Subscript i Baseline Delta y Subscript j Baseline Delta z Subscript k Baselineρ(xi, y j, zk)/xi/y j/zk. 
The corresponding gravitational potential at a point left parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesis element of upper E cubed(x, y, z) ∈E3 is

We are able to show that the integral has sense even for pointsleft parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesis element of upper D(x, y, z) ∈D. Consider 
a change of coordinates in upper E cubedE3 deﬁned by 
u equals x plus r sine x squared cosine x Superscript 1u = x + r sin x2 cos x1
v equals y plus r sine x squared sine x Superscript 1v = y + r sin x2 sin x1
w equals z plus r cosine x squared periodw = z + r cos x2.

The effect of translation due to a tidal acceleration is called a tidal effect. 
We can better see the tidal effect, if we consider slices in upper O x yOxy- and upper O x zOxz-planes.

at left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0, 0) having radius aa and the oceans tides appear when you rotate the sphere. 
This is the animated picture of the tidal effect. 
The tidal effect appears and it can be studied as previously. 
If we wish to highlight the equations of the tidal effect, we need to consider free-

points of a given curve c left parenthesis q right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x left parenthesis q right parenthesis comma y left parenthesis q right parenthesis comma z left parenthesis q right parenthesis right parenthesisc(q) = (x(q), y(q), z(q)) as we presented in the previous

alent formula of the tidal effect written with respect to the geometry of a metric as 
seen in the same previous chapter.

The Kepler Laws 
We intend to obtain the three Kepler laws regarding the motion of planets around the 
Sun. It is necessary to understand how Newtonian mechanics together with Euclidean 
geometry describe these laws and, for this reason, let us prepare the geometric frame-
work we need. 
An ellipse of foci upper F 1 left parenthesis f comma 0 right parenthesisF1( f, 0) and upper F 2 left parenthesis negative f comma 0 right parenthesis comma f greater than 0F2(−f, 0), f > 0 is the locus of points upper PP in 
the Euclidean plane such that StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper F 1 EndAbsoluteValue plus StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper F 2 EndAbsoluteValue equals 2 a|P F1| + |P F2| = 2a, where aa is a positive constant, 
a greater than fa > f . The equation of the ellipse can be found after we transform the condition 
StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper F 1 EndAbsoluteValue plus StartAbsoluteValue upper P upper F 2 EndAbsoluteValue equals 2 a|P F1| + |P F2| = 2a into the equation

StartFraction x squared Over a squared EndFraction plus StartFraction y squared Over b squared EndFraction equals 1x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1
where b squared equals a squared minus f squaredb2 = a2 −f 2. 
The line upper F 1 upper F 2F1F2 is called the major axis and the points where the ellipse cuts the 
major axis have the coordinates left parenthesis a comma 0 right parenthesis(a, 0) and left parenthesis negative a comma 0 right parenthesis(−a, 0). 
The middle of the intervalupper F 1 upper F 2F1F2 is called the centre of the ellipse. In this case, the 
centre of ellipse is the origin upper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0). 
The minor axis is perpendicular to the major axis at upper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0). The minor axis 
intersects the ellipse at the points left parenthesis 0 comma b right parenthesis(0, b) and left parenthesis 0 comma negative b right parenthesis(0, −b).

If we look at comets, the trajectories can be elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic. 
The case e equals 1e = 1 is a possible case, but it is difﬁcult for an astronomer to say that 
a comet has a parabolic orbit. It is more probable to have a hyperbolic orbit with 
e greater than 1e > 1 but very close to 11. We prefer to remain at the case {planet, Sun} where the 
trajectories are always ellipses. Now we are able to prove the Kepler second law.

Circular Motion, Centripetal Force, Deﬂection of Light 
Effect, and Dark Matter Problem 
Before continuing, let us discuss a little bit about circular motion and observe the 
differences with respect to the elliptical motion presented above. Circular motion 
means a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle. A boy rotating a 
tide up ball with a chord, a car moving at constant speed on a circular track, or even 
a satellite on its orbit around the Earth can be mathematically modelled as circular 
motions. So, the trajectory is a circle of radius upper RR, the object in circular motion can 
be imagined as a point (with a mass, say mm) moving at constant speed vv. The speed 
vectorModifyingAbove v With right arrow
→v is tangent at each point of the circle. To maintain the point on this trajectory, 
the force vector (that is the acceleration vector, too) has to be imagined as an arrow 
oriented from the point to the centre. Of course, the magnitude of the force has to
8.7 Circular Motion, Centripetal Force, Deﬂection of Light Effect …
197
be the same for all the possible positions, because there are no differences between 
these vectors except the possible directions. This force is called a centripetal force. 
The corresponding acceleration is called centripetal acceleration. 
Let us consider two tangent vectors corresponding to two close points on the 
circumference separated by ad thetadθ angle. Denote byd xdx the length of the arc determined 
by the two points and observe that between the two tangent vectors there is the same 
angle d thetadθ. We have d x equals upper R d thetadx = Rdθ and v equals StartFraction d x Over d t EndFractionv = dx
dt . If d vdv is the vector which connects their 
ends, we may approximate d theta equals StartFraction d v Over v EndFractiondθ = dv
v . It results 
d x equals upper R d theta equals upper R StartFraction d v Over v EndFraction equals v d t commadx = Rdθ = R dv
v = vdt,
that is, 
a colon equals StartFraction d v Over d t EndFraction equals StartFraction v squared Over upper R EndFraction perioda := dv
dt = v2
R .
This is the formula of the centripetal acceleration which allows to write the formula 
of the centripetal force: 
upper F Subscript c Baseline colon equals m StartFraction v squared Over upper R EndFraction periodFc := m v2
R .
How it can be imagined the rotation of the Earth around the Sun using this force? 
The mathematical answer is 
upper F Subscript c Baseline equals StartFraction m v squared Over upper R EndFraction equals StartFraction upper G upper M m Over upper R squared EndFraction equals upper F commaFc = mv2
R
= GMm
R2
= F,
i.e. 
v squared equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over upper R EndFraction commav2 = GM
R
,
thanks to the equivalence principle by whichmm can be simpliﬁed in both sides of the 
equation. This is important because if the radiusupper RR is increasing the orbital speed has 
to decrease. 
Now, since the period of revolution around the circular trajectory is upper T equals StartFraction 2 pi upper R Over v EndFractionT = 2πR
v
, 
we obtain 
upper T squared equals 4 pi squared upper R squared StartFraction 1 Over v squared EndFraction equals StartFraction 4 pi squared upper R cubed Over upper G upper M EndFraction commaT 2 = 4π2R2 1
v2 = 4π2R3
GM ,
that is, upper T squaredT 2 is proportional to upper R cubedR3, or  
StartFraction upper T squared Over upper R cubed EndFraction equals StartFraction 4 pi squared Over upper G upper M EndFraction periodT 2
R3 = 4π2
GM .
It is a sort of approximation of the third Kepler law.

Gravity in Newtonian Mechanics
Let us imagine our Sun or a spherical galaxy and a plane section through their 
centre. Therefore we can imagine both sections as discs. If upper RR is the radius of such a 
disc it remains only to imagine a ray of light passing through the vicinity of the disc. 
It makes sense to consider the timeDelta t/t when the ray of light is affected by gravity to 
be 
Delta t equals StartFraction 2 upper R Over c EndFraction comma/t = 2R
c ,
wherecc is the speed of light. The gravitational forceupper FF which acts to bend the ray of 
light has the gravitational acceleration described by the formula 
a equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over upper R squared EndFraction commaa = GM
R2 ,
where upper MM is the mass of, let us say, the Sun. Now, denote by Delta v/v the variation of the 
speed of light when it is affected by Sun’s gravity. We have 
Delta v equals a Delta t equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over upper R squared EndFraction dot StartFraction 2 upper R Over c EndFraction equals StartFraction 2 upper G upper M Over upper R c EndFraction period/v = a/t = GM
R2 · 2R
c
= 2GM
Rc .
A right triangle of speeds can be imagined. The deﬂected ray is the hypotenuse, 
the other two sides are “cc” and “Delta v/v” and the acute angle of deﬂection isalphaα, such that 
tangent alpha equals StartFraction Delta v Over c EndFraction equals StartFraction 2 upper G upper M Over upper R c squared EndFraction period tan α = /v
c
= 2GM
Rc2 .
Taking into consideration that alphaα is small, tangent alpha almost equals alphatan α ≈α, therefore 
alpha equals StartFraction 2 upper G upper M Over upper R c squared EndFraction periodα = 2GM
Rc2 .
This value is half the value we measure in practice. Therefore the real value of 
deﬂection is 
alpha equals StartFraction 4 upper G upper M Over upper R c squared EndFractionα = 4GM
Rc2
and will be computed using a metric in the chapter dedicated to general relativity. 
The centripetal force is often used in approximations of trajectories in astronomy. 
An interesting application of the centripetal force is the possible existence of dark 
matter or, according to Fritz Zwicky, the missing matter [200]. The formula 
v squared equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over upper R EndFraction commav2 = GM
R ,
which asserts that if upper RR is increasing, the speed vv decreases (if upper MM remains constant), 
is crucial.
8.8 The Mechanical Lagrangian
199
In a galaxy, there are billions of stars. We may think that these stars are in an 
imaginary sphere having as a centre, the centre of the galaxy. Some stars are closer 
to the centre of the galaxy, some of them are far. Some other stars are out of the edge 
of the galaxy, or, more precisely, they are in the area where, if we increase the radius 
of the galaxy, we add few stars. For stars in the zone with a lot of stars, if we increase 
the radius we have more stars, i.e. more mass. Here, the fact that the observed speed 
of stars rotating around the centre is the same it is not a problem. The speed vv can 
be kept constant, if the mass upper MM increases when upper RR increases. But for distant stars, 
when we increase the radius, we do not add more mass inside. However the measured 
speed vv is the same and it is more or less constant also very far from the galactic 
centre (more than 10 kiloparsec). According to this situation, we have to suppose the 
existence of a sort of (sub-luminous) matter that cannot be detected by the standard 
electromagnetic emission. However, the amount of such a matter increases with the 
increase of the distance from the centre. The problem is known as the dark matter 
problem and can be solved in two alternative ways: Either one suppose the existence 
of exotic matter interacting only gravitationally, or one assumes deviation from the 
Kepler laws at large distances. More details can be found in [ 56, 141, 142].

initial point left parenthesis t 1 comma x left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis right parenthesis(t1, x(t1)) and the ﬁnal point left parenthesis t 2 comma x left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis right parenthesis(t2, x(t2)). 
Let us underline that this trajectory is the expression of the force acting on the 
particle under some initial conditions. Therefore, there is an unique trajectory deter-
mined by the force and the initial conditions. 
Now let us consider all the paths connecting left parenthesis t 1 comma x left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis right parenthesis(t1, x(t1)) and left parenthesis t 2 comma x left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis right parenthesis(t2, x(t2)). They can 
be thought as y left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus eta left parenthesis t right parenthesisy(t) + η(t), with y left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis equals x left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis comma y left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis equals x left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis comma eta left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis equals eta left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis equals 0 periody(t1) = x(t1), y(t2) = x(t2), η(t1) = η(t2) = 0.
Having all these paths, what new theory do we need to imagine in order to discover 
the original path described by Newton’s equation of motion? 
To answer this question, we need some technical details (see also [102]). 
Let us insist on this ﬁrst part when we have described what we want to do. We 
have usedupper VV such thatupper F equals minus StartFraction d upper V Over d x EndFractionF = −dV
dx . We deﬁnedupper VV as an independent potential and we 
suggested its connection with the force upper FF, d upper V equals minus upper F d xdV = −Fdx. 
Is this deﬁnition connected to the facts seen in our previous sections when we 
have studied the gravitational force and the gravitational potential? The answer is 
yes, but we need to point out a major difference between thisupper VV and the gravitational 
potential upper PhiΦ. 
Consider a body of mass upper MM at the origin upper OO of a line whose current coordinate is 
denoted byxx. Suppose that at pointupper N left parenthesis x right parenthesisN(x), a body of massmm exists. The gravitational 
force in this case has the intensityupper F equals StartFraction upper G upper M m Over x squared EndFractionF = GMm
x2
. The work done by the body of massupper MM
to move the body of massmm fromxx tox minus d xx −dx isminus upper F d x−Fdx. There is an energy transferred 
to do this work. Its variationDelta upper E/E isminus upper F d x−Fdx. By deﬁnition, the gravitational potential 
energyupper P Subscript upper E Baseline left parenthesis r right parenthesisPE(r) is related to the work done to move the body of massmm from the inﬁnity 
to the point having coordinate rr, that is, 
upper P Subscript upper E Baseline left parenthesis r right parenthesis equals integral Subscript normal infinity Superscript r Baseline upper F d x equals integral Subscript normal infinity Superscript r Baseline StartFraction upper G upper M m Over x squared EndFraction d x equals minus StartFraction upper G upper M m Over r EndFraction periodPE(r) =
{ r

Fdx =

dx = −GMm

.
The potential energy can be denoted by upper P Subscript upper EPE. If one looks at the formula obtained 
and takes into account the formula of the gravitational potential minus StartFraction upper G upper M Over r EndFraction−GM
r
, we can 
understand both the explanations above and the relation 
upper P Subscript upper E Baseline equals m upper Phi periodPE = mΦ.
Therefore, another deﬁnition for the gravitational potential appears: the work (energy 
transferred) per unit mass necessary to move a body from inﬁnity to the point having 
the coordinate rr. Indeed,

In the case when we consider the constant gravitational ﬁeld determined by the 
constant acceleration gg between the origin upper OO and a point upper HH at the coordinate hh, the  
potential energy is expressed by the formula upper P Subscript upper E Baseline equals m g hPE = mgh. The explanation is related 
to the difference of formal integrals 
upper P Subscript upper E Baseline colon equals upper P Subscript upper E Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesis minus upper P Subscript upper E Baseline left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals integral Subscript normal infinity Superscript h Baseline g m d x minus integral Subscript normal infinity Superscript 0 Baseline g m d x equals integral Subscript 0 Superscript h Baseline g m d x equals g m hPE := PE(h) −PE(0) =
{ h

gmdx −
{ 0
∞
gmdx =
{ h
0
gmdx = gmh
which describes the amount of energy necessary to move the body at hh to 00. 
In the same way, we can deﬁne the kinetic energy. Let us start from upper F equals m a equals m StartFraction d v Over d t EndFractionF = ma =
m dv
dt written in its discrete form, upper F equals m StartFraction Delta v Over Delta t EndFraction periodF = m /v
/t . If we multiply by Delta r/r, we obtain 
upper F Delta r equals m StartFraction Delta v Over Delta t EndFraction Delta r equals m StartFraction Delta r Over Delta t EndFraction Delta v equals m v Delta v commaF/r = m /v
/t /r = m /r
/t /v = mv/v,
which can be written in the differential way as 
upper F d r equals m v d v periodFdr = mvdv.
Now, the amount of energy necessary to bring a body initially at rest to the speed vv
is 
upper T left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals integral Subscript 0 Superscript v Baseline upper F d x equals integral Subscript o Superscript v Baseline m x d x equals m StartFraction v squared Over 2 EndFraction periodT (v) =

Sincevv can be seen asModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙x(t), we may consider the kinetic energy of the mechanical 
system deﬁned by the formula upper T equals upper T left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot right parenthesis colon equals one half m left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis squaredT = T (˙x) := 1
2m(˙x(t))2. Another possible notation 
is upper K Subscript upper EKE. Here, with mechanical system we intend a system of elements that interact 
on mechanical principles. A material point and a force which acts on it is a possible 
example. Two material points which interact through the gravitational force offer 
another example. In this perspective, the next exercise has important consequences 
in Newtonian mechanics. 
Exercise 8.8.1 Consider a mechanical system whose kinetic energy is upper T left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot right parenthesis colon equals one half m left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis squaredT (˙x) :=

dx ). Show that the total energy of the system, upper T plus upper VT + V , is a constant.

Hint. If we derive with respect to tt the total energy, we obtain 
StartFraction d Over d t EndFraction left parenthesis upper T plus upper V right parenthesis equals left parenthesis m ModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis x With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus StartFraction d upper V Over d x EndFraction StartFraction d x Over d t EndFraction right parenthesis equals left parenthesis m x With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis minus upper F right parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals 0 comma d

that is, upper T plus upper VT + V is a constant. 
We deﬁne the mechanical Lagrangian of the system by 
upper L equals upper L left parenthesis x comma ModifyingAbove x With dot right parenthesis colon equals upper T minus upper V equals one half m left parenthesis ModifyingAbove x With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis squared minus upper V left parenthesis x right parenthesis periodL = L(x, ˙x) := T −V = 1
2m(˙x(t))2 −V (x).
In this section, where there is no possibility of confusion, we simply use the deﬁnition 
“Lagrangian” instead of mechanical Lagrangian. Later in the book, we will see that 
there exist general Lagrangians which come from Geometry, therefore we have to 
well understand the nature of the Lagrangian we are considering. 
Let us observe that, even ifxx andModifyingAbove x With dot˙x depends ontt, this Lagrangian is only implicitly 
a function of time. 
In this formalism, it makes sense to consider a functional called action, 
upper S left bracket y right bracket equals integral Subscript t 1 Superscript t 2 Baseline left bracket one half m left parenthesis ModifyingAbove y With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis squared minus upper V left parenthesis y right parenthesis right bracket d tS[y] =

which exists for any path y left parenthesis t right parenthesisy(t), not only for the “physical right on” which is x left parenthesis t right parenthesisx(t). 
Now consider the action corresponding to y left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus eta left parenthesis t right parenthesisy(t) + η(t), 
upper S left bracket y plus eta right bracket equals integral Subscript t 1 Superscript t 2 Baseline left bracket one half m left parenthesis ModifyingAbove y With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus ModifyingAbove eta With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis squared minus upper V left parenthesis y left parenthesis t right parenthesis plus eta left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis right bracket d t periodS[y + η] =

upper S left bracket y plus eta right bracket equals upper S left bracket y right bracket plus integral Subscript t 1 Superscript t 2 Baseline left bracket m ModifyingAbove y With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis ModifyingAbove eta With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis minus StartFraction d upper V Over d y EndFraction left parenthesis y left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis eta left parenthesis t right parenthesis right bracket d t plus double struck upper O left parenthesis eta squared right parenthesis commaS[y + η] = S[y] +

where double struck upper O left parenthesis eta squared right parenthesisO(η2) are terms of order eta squared colon equals eta squared left parenthesis t right parenthesisη2 := η2(t) or higher. We can write

where

Therefore, delta upper S identical to 0δS ≡0 means

We have proved: 
Theorem 8.8.2 The ﬁrst-order variation of the action upper SS vanishes, i.e. 
delta upper S equals integral Subscript t 1 Superscript t 2 Baseline left bracket m ModifyingAbove y With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis ModifyingAbove eta With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis minus StartFraction d upper V Over d y EndFraction left parenthesis y left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesis eta left parenthesis t right parenthesis right bracket d t equals 0 commaδS =

if and only if y left parenthesis t right parenthesisy(t) satisﬁes Newton’s equation of motion 
m x With two dots left parenthesis t right parenthesis minus upper F left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals 0 periodm ¨x(t) −F(x) = 0.
So, the answer is: The “physical right path” happens when the ﬁrst-order variation 
delta upper SδS vanishes. Therefore the right path is described by the condition delta upper S identical to 0δS ≡0. This is  
known as Hamilton’s stationary action principle.

Can we ﬁnd an equation, satisﬁed by a general function upper L left parenthesis x comma ModifyingAbove x With dot right parenthesisL(x, ˙x), not only by 
the mechanical Lagrangian upper L equals upper T minus upper VL = T −V as before, such that the functionx equals x left parenthesis t right parenthesisx = x(t),

which preserves the endpoints left parenthesis t 1 comma x left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolon left parenthesis t 2 comma x left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis right parenthesis(t1, x(t1)); (t2, x(t2)), that is, eta left parenthesis t 1 right parenthesis equals eta left parenthesis t 2 right parenthesis equals 0η(t1) = η(t2) = 0 and

ofupper L left parenthesis y left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove y With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis right parenthesisL(y(t), ˙y(t)). In the particular case, when the Lagrangian does not depend explic-
itly ontt, the Euler–Lagrange equation reduces to the Beltrami identity. The following 
theorem holds. 
Theorem 8.9.3 (Beltrami’s identity) If the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly 
on tt, then a constant upper CC exists such that

the same height above the ﬂoor and its mass on the unit length isrhoρ. Find the function 
which describes the shape of the rope.

statement conditions allow us to consider a minimum point at upper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0), a symmetry 
with respect toupper O yOy-axis andupper O xOx-axis as a tangent to the curve atupper OO. Consider a point

These equations are called the Euler–Lagrange equations. 
They represent an equivalent way to express Newton’s equations of motion in 
several variables for the Lagrangian upper L equals upper T minus upper V periodL = T −V. However, they are more general 
than the Newton equations because accelerations are not required in an explicit form. 
See [ 14] for a general discussion.

These facts involving the extremization of a functional and the examples rise some 
fundamental questions. 
• Is there Geometry involved? 
• Are the Euler–Lagrange equations, the geodesic equations for a given metric in 
which the Lagrangian is involved? 
• Why upper L squaredL2 appeared? 
The next theorem answers at all these questions.

We can see a new feature of Lagrangians: they are important because they induce 
metrics whose geodesics are described by the Euler–Lagrange equations. 
Finally, we can see a possible switch between the traditional mechanical point 
of view for several models in Physics to the geometric point of view. Somehow the 
forces, the energies, some other functions involved in describing “the reality” can be 
replaced by geometric objects from differential geometry. The trajectories created 
by forces are now geodesics of spaces with metrics induced by Lagrangians. As we 
will see below, this point of view is fundamental in general relativity.
Chapter 9 
Special Relativity 
Numerus omnium aptantur. 
Pythagoras 
In seventeenth-century, Newton considered light as a collection of particles, now 
called photons according to Quantum Mechanics, traveling through space. Reﬂection 
and refraction of light were explained in a satisfactory way interpreting light rays 
as trajectory of photons. 
James Clark Maxwell results on Electrodynamics, in the middle of the nineteenth-
century, offered another view: the light is an electromagnetic wave. 
Maxwell’s equations of Electromagnetism are not simple at all, and, putting them in 
accordance with Newton’s theory, points out the necessity of considering a medium 
in which the electromagnetic waves travel through space. This hypothetical medium 
was called “ether”. 
Ernst Mach did not agree with the idea of ether and observed the necessity of the 
revision of all fundamental concepts of Physics. Michelson-Morley experiment, who 
initially was designed to reveal such an ether, had a result completely different with 
respect the expectations and hard to interpret in view of Classical Mechanics. Albert 
Einstein explained the result of the experiment in a theory, the Special Relativity, 
where he revised, in a fundamental way, the ideas of space and time. After this 
achievement, no place remained for ether. For a comprehensive exposition of Special 
Relativity, see [100].

sayd 1d1, coincident to the sense of motion, the other one, say d 2d2, perpendicular to the 
sense of motion. On d 1d1, called the longitudinal direction, in this order, there exist: a 
source of light denoted byupper S Subscript upper LSL, an interferometer placed inupper II and a mirror denoted by 
upper M 1M1, such that the distance between upper II and upper M 1M1 is ll. 
The interferometer is a device able to split a light-ray in the two perpendicular 
directionsd 1d1 andd 2d2, but also to receive two light-rays from perpendicular directions 
and to send them separately to another given direction. 
On the line d 2d2, which corresponds to the transversal direction, there is another 
mirror denoted by upper M 2M2, such that the distance between upper II and upper M 2M2 is the same ll and a 
receiver-device upper R Subscript upper LRL such that the interferometer upper II is between upper M 2M2 and upper R Subscript upper LRL. 
The receiver-device is able to capture the light rays coming from the interferometer 
and to decide which one reached ﬁrst the device (Figs. 9.1 and 9.2). 
The experiment is like this: when the platform is at rest or it is moving at constant 
speed vv in the upper S Subscript upper L Baseline upper ISL I longitudinal direction, a light-ray is sent by the source upper S Subscript upper LSL to the 
interferometer upper II. The interferometer splits the light-ray in two light-rays. The ﬁrst 
one is sent to the mirror upper M 1M1, it is reﬂected by the mirror and it is returned to the 
interferometer which sends it toupper R Subscript upper LRL. The second one is directed toupper M 2M2, it is reﬂected 
and sent to the interferometer which sends it to upper R Subscript upper LRL. Which one reaches ﬁrst upper R Subscript upper LRL? 
This is something as: we are interested in identifying the inﬂuence of the speed 
vv on the splitted light-rays. There is, or there is not, a difference between what is

happening when the platform is at rest comparing with the case when the platform 
is moving at constant speed vv? 
Let us observe something obvious: if the platform is at rest, both light-rays reach 
at same time upper R Subscript upper LRL. 
Now, let us try to use Classical Mechanics to describe what is happening when the 
platform is moving at constant speedvv. First at all, let us observe that it is enough to 
establish only the time necessary to cover the routesupper I upper M 1 upper II M1I andupper I upper M 2 upper II M2I and to compare 
them. 
Denote by cc the speed of light. The time to cover the longitudinal route upper I upper M 1 upper II M1I is 
t 1 equals StartFraction l Over c minus v EndFraction plus StartFraction l Over c plus v EndFraction equals StartFraction 2 l c Over c squared minus v squared EndFraction commat1 =
l
c −v +
l
c + v =
2lc
c2 −v2 ,
because c minus vc −v and c plus vc + v are in Newtonian mechanics the speeds for the directions 
upper I upper M 1 comma upper M 1 upper II M1, M1I respectively. To be sure that the reader understands why the speeds are 
like this, let us focus on the ﬁrst direction case. Moving at constant speed vv in the 
sense upper I upper M 1I M1, the photon is slowed down by the air, that is by the medium in which it 
is traveling, with the speed negative v−v. Therefore, according to mechanics rules, the speed 
of the photon traveling in upper I upper M 1I M1 direction is c minus vc −v. 
For the transversal direction, denote by t primet' the time necessary for the light-ray to 
reach the mirror upper M 2M2. During this time, the platform, therefore the mirror, travels 
in the longitudinal direction a t prime vt'v space. The Pythagoras theorem in the rectangle 
triangle formed is left parenthesis t prime c right parenthesis squared equals l squared plus left parenthesis t prime v right parenthesis squared(t'c)2 = l2 + (t'v)2, that is 
t prime equals StartFraction l Over StartRoot c squared minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction periodt' =
l
√
c2 −v2 .
It is obvious that the time necessary to the transversal ray to reach again the interfer-
ometer upper II is t 2 colon equals 2 t primet2 := 2t', so we have  
t 2 equals StartFraction 2 l Over StartRoot c squared minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction periodt2 =

√
c2 −v2 .
Therefore 
StartFraction t 2 Over t 1 EndFraction equals StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction v squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot commat2
t1
=

1 −v2
c2 ,
which implies 
t 2 less than t 1 commat2 < t1,
i.e. the transversal light-ray reaches earlierupper R Subscript upper LRL compared to the longitudinal light-ray. 
The mathematical model made with respect to the rules of Classical Mechanics 
has a prediction, let us repeat it: the ﬁrst light-ray arriving in upper R Subscript upper LRL is the transversal 
one.
9.1 Principles of Special Relativity
221
If we make the experiment the result is: the transversal and the longitudinal light-
rays reach upper R Subscript upper LRL at the same time. If we repeat it, the same results holds. There is not 
a difference between what happens when the platform is at rest, comparing with the 
case when the platform is moving at constant speed vv. 
As we explained in the introduction, the error is in the model: it is related to the 
fact we thought that vv could affect the speed of light. It seems that c minus vc −v and c plus vc + v
are not correctly thought, therefore we have not to consider Classical Mechanics 
when we try to understand this experiment. Another rule has to be applied when we 
“add” velocities. 
This experiment can be also seen making a parallel between the platform moving 
in Earth atmosphere at constant speed vv and the Earth moving through the ether at 
constant speedvv. After we establish a new theory to explain the experimental result, 
the main consequence is the fact that there is no ether 1. 
The consequences of Einstein’s postulates give the chance to understand how the 
light propagates in the context of a new physical theory, the Special Relativity, which 
changes the rules of Classical Mechanics when we are dealing with bodies moving 
at very large speeds. 
Part of these results were also obtained by Henry Poincaré in his effort to explain 
the Michelson-Morley experiment. 
Essentially, Einstein formulated the Special Relativity starting from two main 
postulates: 
1. The laws of Physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. 
2. The speed of light in vacuum, denoted by c almost equals 2 comma 99 dot 10 Superscript 8 Baseline m divided by sc ≈2, 99 · 108 m/s, is the same 
for all the observers and it is the maximal speed reached by a moving object. 
Einstein used the word observer with the meaning of reference frame from which 
a set of objects or events are measured. Since the measurement are generally made 
with respect to the center upper OO of the frame, this special point is often called the “upper OO
observer” or we may refer to a frame with “the observer placed atupper OO”. We know that 
the laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial frames. The ﬁrst postulate asks 
for the same form of electromagnetic laws in any inertial reference frames, as the 
mechanics laws have. And in general, all laws of Physics must have the same form 
in all reference frames (this result will be fully achieved in General Relativity). 
The second postulates plays a key role in Special Relativity being involved in the 
way in which we derive the Lorentz transformations. 
The framework of Newton’s laws of mechanics is the three-dimensional Euclidean 
space. Each object is described by a point or by a collection of points of it. Time is 
given by a universal clock and allows us to see the evolution of objects. 
In Special Relativity, we have to work in a four-dimensional space, but not in an 
usual one. Three of the dimensions are the standard dimensions used in mechanics.
1 In modern physics, it has been realized that “ether” is the “physical vacuum” that is a maximally 
symmetric conﬁguration of space-time where no physical ﬁeld is present. This means that matter-
energy density is extremely low. In this “vacuum”, electromagnetic waves propagate at the speed 
of light.

We can denote them with the letters asx Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubedx1, x2, x3. The fourth dimension is related to 
time. 
Deﬁnition 9.1.1 A frame of coordinates left parenthesis t comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(t, x1, x2, x3) is called a space-time. 
The Geometry of a space-time is in fact what we are trying to develop, and this is 
made according to some given physical postulates we have to accept. 
Deﬁnition 9.1.2 Each point of such a space-time is called an event. 
Deﬁnition 9.1.3 A curve of the space-time is called a world line and represents a 
successions of events. 
Example 9.1.4 Suppose we work in a two dimensional slice of the previous frame, 
with the coordinatesleft parenthesis t comma x cubed right parenthesis(t, x3). Consider a world line starting from the the originupper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0). 
Suppose the next point is upper A left parenthesis 1 comma x 0 cubed right parenthesisA(1, x3
0). Then the object remain t 0t0 seconds at rest with 
respect our perspective. This means that the world line has to be continued with 
the segment upper A upper BAB, where upper BB has the coordinates upper B left parenthesis 1 plus t 0 comma x 0 cubed right parenthesisB(1 + t0, x3
0). Next, suppose the 
object advances in the direction minus v 1−v1. The line followed has the equation x cubed minus x 0 cubed equals minus v 1 left parenthesis t minus left parenthesis 1 plus t 0 right parenthesis right parenthesisx3 −x3
0 =
−v1(t −(1 + t0)), etc.  
Example 9.1.5 From the originupper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0) an object is movingt 1t1 seconds in the direc-
tion negative v−v. It reaches the point upper M left parenthesis t 1 comma minus v t 1 right parenthesisM(t1, −vt1). Negative speed means only the direction 
of evolution in time. 
Example 9.1.6 A photon is released from the origin upper OO. There are two possible 
directions, cc and negative c−c. If it is released in the direction cc, its trajectory will be the 
line x cubed equals c tx3 = ct. Or, it can be released in the direction negative c−c. Its trajectory in this case is 
x cubed equals minus c tx3 = −ct. In this case, aftert 0 greater than 0t0 > 0 seconds, the photon reaches the pointupper L left parenthesis t 0 comma minus c t 0 right parenthesisL(t0, −ct0). 
In order to advance into the theory, we have to consider two local frames of coor-
dinates, one moving at constant speed vv, denoted by upper SS, and another one considered 
at rest, denoted byupper RR. The letters are chosen from the words “speed” and “rest”. Two 
observers are placed at the origins of each system denoted byupper O overbar ¯O, respectivelyupper OO. The  
ﬁrst local frame upper SS is considered described by the coordinates left parenthesis tau equals x overbar Superscript 0 Baseline comma x overbar Superscript 1 Baseline comma x overbar squared comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ = ¯x0, ¯x1, ¯x2, ¯x3), 
while the frame upper RR is described by the coordinates left parenthesis t equals x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(t = x0, x1, x2, x3). 
Now, the reference frames of the two observers have to adapt to the second pos-
tulate of the Special Relativity. To be easier in our reasonings, let us suppose the 
bidimensional case when the frameupper SS consists of the coordinatesleft parenthesis tau equals x overbar Superscript 0 Baseline comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ = ¯x0, ¯x3) and it 
is moving, at constant speed vv, in the same plane as the one determined by upper RR, here 
denoted as left parenthesis t equals x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x cubed right parenthesis(t = x0, x3). 
First at all, how can we express the fact thatupper SS is moving at constant speedvv with 
respect toupper RR? The simple mathematical answer is: the axisupper O overbar tau ¯Oτ inupper RR has the equation 
x cubed equals v tx3 = vt. 
Even if the light can be seen as an electromagnetic wave and we check the conser-
vation of the form of Maxwell’s equations by the Lorentz transformations, in order to 
develop Special Relativity, we can consider the light-rays as trajectories of photons.
9.1 Principles of Special Relativity
223
What can we say about the world line of a photon in these inertial reference 
frames? With respect to the observers in each frame, two world lines are highlighted: 
a photon moving at constant speed cc with a trajectory x cubed equals c tx3 = ct in upper RR and x overbar cubed equals c tau¯x3 = cτ in 
upper SS, while, for a photon moving at speed negative c−c, we have the lines x cubed equals minus c tx3 = −ct in upper RR and 
x overbar cubed equals minus c tau¯x3 = −cτ in upper SS. 
The two world lines of photons atupper OO form the light cone of the frameupper RR. A similar 
deﬁnition holds in upper SS. 
Therefore, if we use a same diagram for both frames, the second postulate has the 
following mathematical expression: 
1. The lines x cubed equals c tx3 = ct in upper RR and x overbar cubed equals c tau¯x3 = cτ in upper SS have the same image; 
2. The lines x cubed equals minus c tx3 = −ct in upper RR and x overbar cubed equals minus c tau¯x3 = −cτ in upper SS have the same image. 
In other words, the two light cones are coincident. 
Since we deal with inertial frames, as a rule, objects moving at constant speed 
in upper SS move at constant speed in upper RR, and vice versa. So, a straight line representing a 
world line of an object moving at constant speed in upper SS, it is seen as a straight line 
representing the world line of the same object moving at (another) constant speed in 
upper RR and vice versa. Transforming lines into lines, the change of coordinates between 
the two frames is described by a linear map; we denote it by upper L Subscript vLv and we call it a 
Lorentz transformation corresponding to the speed vv. 
Theorem 9.1.7 In the context described before, the matrix of the Lorentz transfor-
mation corresponding to the speed vv has the form

Lorentz Transformations in Geometric Coordinates 
and Consequences 
In Physics, systems of coordinates are thought with axes whose coordinates are 
related to the physical units as second, meter, etc. The systems of coordinates cor-
responding to the physical units can be called systems of physical coordinates. In  
the previous sections, we worked in physical coordinates. The units of measure in 
Physics were thought before understanding how deeply is the Geometry involved 
in the description of the physical phenomena. If we choose an appropriate “length” 
(e.g. the meter) and an appropriate “time duration” (e.g. the second), the speed of 
light can be c equals 1c = 1. We call these new units geometric units. All formulas become 
simpler and the geometric images are more intuitive. 
Deﬁnition 9.2.1 The coordinates corresponding to geometric units are called geo-
metric coordinates.

in geometric coordinates, it is easier to understand how it looks like the frameupper SS seen 
inupper RR: sinceupper O equals upper O overbarO = ¯O, the axisupper O x overbar cubedO ¯x3 andupper O tauOτ are symmetric with respect the linex cubed equals tx3 = t. 
Before obtaining the Lorentz transformations in geometric coordinates, let us 
consider the concept of simultaneity. 
9.2.1 
The Relativity of Simultaneity 
Two events, upper E 1E1 and upper E 2E2, are called simultaneous in upper SS, if they happen at the same 
moment of time tau 0τ0 in upper SS, that is they are upper E 1 left parenthesis tau 0 comma tau 0 right parenthesisE1(τ0, τ0) and upper E 2 left parenthesis tau 0 comma minus tau 0 right parenthesisE2(τ0, −τ0). The  same, two  
events, upper U 1U1 and upper U 2U2, are called simultaneous in upper RR if they happen at the same moment 
of time t 0t0 in upper RR, i.e. they are upper U 1 left parenthesis t 0 comma t 0 right parenthesisU1(t0, t0) and upper U 2 left parenthesis t 0 comma minus t 0 right parenthesisU2(t0, −t0). 
On the same diagram, it is easy to see that upper U 1U1 and upper U 2U2 are simultaneous in upper RR, but  
upper U 1 left parenthesis t 0 comma t 0 right parenthesisU1(t0, t0) and upper V 2 left parenthesis t 0 StartFraction 1 minus v Over 1 plus v EndFraction comma minus t 0 StartFraction 1 minus v Over 1 plus v EndFraction right parenthesisV2
(
t0
1 −v
1 + v , −t0

1 + v
)
are simultaneous in upper SS. 
Let us explain the result from the mathematical point of view. 
It is not very difﬁcult to show that, in geometric coordinates, ifupper O tauOτ has the equation 
x cubed equals v tx3 = vt, thenupper O x overbar cubedO ¯x3 has the equationx cubed equals StartFraction 1 Over v EndFraction tx3 = 1
v t. Therefore the liney minus t 0 equals StartFraction 1 Over v EndFraction left parenthesis t minus t 0 right parenthesisy −t0 = 1
v (t −t0)
intersects x cubed equals negative tx3 = −t, if t equals t 0 StartFraction 1 minus v Over 1 plus v EndFractiont = t0
1 −v
1 + v . 
For the observer inupper RR, the eventsupper U 1 left parenthesis t 0 comma t 0 right parenthesisU1(t0, t0) andupper U 2 left parenthesis t 0 comma minus t 0 right parenthesisU2(t0, −t0) happen simultaneously. 
The observer in upper SS cannot agree: for him upper U 1 left parenthesis t 0 comma t 0 right parenthesisU1(t0, t0) and upper V 2 left parenthesis t 0 StartFraction 1 minus v Over 1 plus v EndFraction comma minus t 0 StartFraction 1 minus v Over 1 plus v EndFraction right parenthesisV2

9.2.3 
The Minkowski Geometry of Inertial Frames 
in Geometric Coordinates and Consequences: Time 
Dilation and Length Contraction 
Let us observe that the addition of velocities was deduced using Einstein’s postulates 
and more, it is related to the Minkowski Geometry attached toupper SS andupper RR frames. Why? 
Because if we choose 
v equals hyperbolic tangent alpha semicolon w equals hyperbolic tangent beta commav = tanh α ; w = tanh β,
we obtain the known geometric formula 
hyperbolic tangent left parenthesis alpha plus beta right parenthesis equals StartFraction hyperbolic tangent alpha plus hyperbolic tangent beta Over 1 plus hyperbolic tangent alpha hyperbolic tangent beta EndFraction tanh(α + β) = tanh α + tanh β
1 + tanh α tanh β
for the addition of velocities in geometric coordinates. 
The Lorentz transformation corresponding to the constant speed vv is now 
upper L Subscript hyperbolic tangent alpha Baseline equals Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column hyperbolic cosine alpha 2nd Column hyperbolic sine alpha 2nd Row 1st Column hyperbolic sine alpha 2nd Column hyperbolic cosine alpha EndMatrix periodLtanh α =
( cosh α sinh α

)
.
It is well known that the matrices upper L Subscript hyperbolic tangent alphaLtanh α are hyperbolic rotations in the two-
dimensional Minkowski space denoted by double struck upper M squaredM2, where the Minkowski product of 
the vectors x equals left parenthesis t 1 comma x 1 cubed right parenthesisx = (t1, x3
1) and y equals left parenthesis t 2 comma x 2 cubed right parenthesisy = (t2, x3
2) is deﬁned by 
left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline colon equals t 1 t 2 minus x 1 cubed x 2 cubed period <x, y>M := t1t2 −x3
1x3
2.
It is also known that each matrix upper L Subscript hyperbolic tangent alphaLtanh α preserves the Minkowski product. 
The last property suggests another way to think at the Lorentz transformations in 
the case of geometric coordinates: they preserve the quantity t squared minus left parenthesis x cubed right parenthesis squaredt2 −(x3)2. 
Exercise 9.2.5 Show that Lorentz transformation implies the equality 
tau squared minus left parenthesis x overbar cubed right parenthesis squared equals t squared minus left parenthesis x cubed right parenthesis squared periodτ 2 −(¯x3)2 = t2 −(x3)2.
Hint.

Example 9.2.8 Let us consider two twins separated. The ﬁrst one is sent in space

Earth. When they separated they are2020 years old. After1515 years in space, according

9.2.4 
Relativistic Mass, Rest Mass and Energy 
Newton’s second law involves the concept of inertial mass. As we have seen at that 
time, the mass was considered as a constant. We have discussed about the inertial 
mass and the gravitational mass and how the mass is part of the so called quantity 
of motion, also known as momentum. In Classical Mechanics momentum means 
inertial mass in motion and redeﬁned in a relativistic way, will lead to important 
consequences. 
Let us think at an object at rest, having a rest mass denoted by m 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0. Is the  
mass of the object “moving at constant speed” the same as its rest mass? The answer 
is related to how the relativistic momentum is changing with respect to the Lorentz 
transformations. 
Let us denote bydouble struck upper P equals StartBinomialOrMatrix m Choose m v EndBinomialOrMatrixP =
( m
mv
)
the relativistic momentum of a classical body moving 
at constant speed vv. The second component of the relativistic momentum is the 
classical momentum. 
The relativistic momentum of a classical body at rest inupper SS has to bedouble struck upper P 0 equals StartBinomialOrMatrix m 0 Choose 0 EndBinomialOrMatrix periodP0 =
(m0
0
)
.
According to the theory we are developing, the formula of the relativistic momentum 
at constant speedvv is obtained from the relativistic momentum at rest, changed with 
respect to the Lorentz transformation upper L Subscript vLv. This was the key point where Einstein 
applied, in a brilliant way, the idea that all physical formulas have to be invariant 
under Lorentz transformations. The consequences can be seen in the following two 
theorems. 
Theorem 9.2.11 If m 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0 is the rest mass of a body moving at constant speed vv, 
then 
m equals m left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction periodm = m(v) =
m0
√
1 −v2 .
Proof Using the Lorentz transformation upper L Subscript vLv we have double struck upper P equals upper L Subscript v Baseline dot double struck upper P 0 periodP = Lv · P0. It results 
StartBinomialOrMatrix m Choose m v EndBinomialOrMatrix equals StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column 1 2nd Column v 2nd Row 1st Column v 2nd Column 1 EndMatrix dot StartBinomialOrMatrix m 0 Choose 0 EndBinomialOrMatrix comma

which leads to the so called relativistic mass formula 
m equals m left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction periodm = m(v) =
m0
√
1 −v2 .
[
We may observe that the mass of an object is increasing when the object travel at 
constant speedvv. Another consequence is related to the fact that an object having its 
rest mass m 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0 can not reach the speed of light. 
Deﬁnition 9.2.12 m left parenthesis v right parenthesism(v) is called relativistic mass corresponding to the constant 
speed vv of an object having the rest mass m 0m0. 
The previous obtained formula has sense whenm 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0. The physicists know that 
there is no rest mass for the photon. Therefore this formula does not work for photon 
or for any other physical particle with no rest mass. 
The following theorem explains why it is a good choice to consider the relativistic 
momentum if we intend to show how the mass is changing when it is moving at 
constant speed. Even if the proof is done using the geometric coordinates, the reader 
can change it to adapt the result to physical coordinates. 
Theorem 9.2.13 The relativistic mass formula is preserved by the Lorentz transfor-
mations.

We are close to prove a very important consequence of the previous relativistic 
mass formula. 
Theorem 9.2.14 In geometric coordinates, mass means energy. 
Proof Denote by f prime comma f double prime f ', f '' the ﬁrst and the second derivative of a real function f f . It  
is easy to prove that 
f left parenthesis x right parenthesis equals f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis plus StartFraction x Over 1 factorial EndFraction f prime left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis plus StartFraction x squared Over 2 factorial EndFraction f double prime left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis plus upper B left bracket x cubed right bracket comma f (x) = f (0) + x

2! f ''(0) + B[x3],
where upper B left bracket x cubed right bracketB[x3] contains only terms in xx with powers greater than 33. 
If we neglect the upper BB terms, when we consider the real function 
f left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction f (v) =

√

and the formula of the relativistic mass, we can write 
m left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals StartFraction m 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared EndRoot EndFraction equals m 0 plus one half m 0 v squared periodm(v) =
m0
√
1 −v2 = m0 + 1

Looking at both members we can observe how, in geometric coordinates, the rela-
tivistic mass is related to the rest mass and the kinetic energy, that is the statement: 
“mass is energy” is conﬁrmed.

The last property suggests another way to think at the Lorentz transformations in the 
case of physical coordinates: they preserve the quantity c squared t squared minus left parenthesis x cubed right parenthesis squaredc2t2 −(x3)2. 
Exercise 9.3.1 Show that 
c squared tau squared minus left parenthesis x overbar cubed right parenthesis squared equals c squared t squared minus left parenthesis x cubed right parenthesis squared periodc2τ 2 −(¯x3)2 = c2t2 −(x3)2.

Now it becomes clear how the physical coordinates can be transformed into “geo-
metric physical coordinates”: The upper O x Superscript 0Ox0 axis has the units done with respect to c tct in 
upper RR. In upper SS, the corresponding axis becomes c taucτ. 
In this way, the unit of measure for the ﬁrst axis is a length, the same as the unit 
for the spatial axes. 
Theorem 9.3.2 Lorentz physical transformations preserves the square of the 
Minkowski norm of vectors. 
However, in the case in which we are not interested in highlighting the Minkowski 
Geometry, we prefer to work in our initial upper RR and upper SS systems of coordinates. 
Consider an inﬁnitesimal time-like interval between the points left parenthesis t comma x right parenthesis(t, x) and left parenthesis t plus d t comma x plus d x right parenthesis(t +
dt, x + dx) and its arclength expressed in the form suggested by the previous invari-
ant, that is 
d s squared equals c squared left parenthesis d t right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x right parenthesis squared periodds2 = c2(dt)2 −(dx)2.
We denoted byxx thex cubedx3 coordinate to make the notations easier. The same interval 
can be seen in a frame such that, at each time tauτ, the moving point which describes 
the interval is at rest. Denote byleft parenthesis tau comma x Subscript tau Baseline right parenthesis(τ, xτ) the world line whose coordinates express the 
moving point at rest. Taking into account the conservation law seen before, we have 
d s squared equals c squared left parenthesis d t right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x right parenthesis squared equals c squared left parenthesis d tau right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x Subscript tau Baseline right parenthesis squared equals c squared left parenthesis d tau right parenthesis squared periodds2 = c2(dt)2 −(dx)2 = c2(dτ)2 −(dxτ)2 = c2(dτ)2.
Therefore 
d s equals c d tau commads = cdτ,

Deﬁnition 9.3.3 Delta tau/τ is called a proper time interval. 
Therefore, we can say that proper time measured along the time-like world line 
above is the time measured by a clock following point by point the considered 
world line. Let us give now an important property of the proper time Delta tau/τ in Special 
Relativity. 
Theorem 9.3.4 (Time dilation in physical coordinates) A clock slows down when it 
is moving at constant speed. 
Proof Denote by Delta tau/τ the unit interval of a clock moving at constant speed vv. This  
clock measures the proper time deﬁned above. It is like you consider the unit oftauτ axis 
inupper SS to beDelta tau/τ. We are interested in knowing the connection between the proper time 
and the time coordinate tt of the frame at rest, upper RR. Denote by Delta t/t the corresponding 
element ofDelta tau/τ after a Lorentz transformationupper L Subscript vLv in geometric coordinates. We have

Relativistic Mass, Rest Mass and Rest Energy 
in Physical Coordinates 
Let us see how it looks like the relativistic mass in the case of physical coordinates. We 
start from an object at rest, having a rest mass denoted bym 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0 with its relativistic 
momentum as in the case of geometrical coordinates in upper SS, double struck upper P 0 equals StartBinomialOrMatrix m 0 Choose 0 EndBinomialOrMatrix periodP0 =

Let us denote bydouble struck upper P equals StartBinomialOrMatrix m Choose m v EndBinomialOrMatrixP =

the relativistic momentum of a classical body mov-
ing at constant speed vv. 
Theorem 9.3.6 If m 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0 is the rest mass of a body moving at constant speed vv, 
then

/
1 −v2/c2 .
[
As in the case of geometrical coordinates, the previous formula holds whenm 0 not equals 0m0 /=
0. 
We are talking about the rest energy, of course, in the same case m 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0. The  
discussion is almost the same as when we proved that, in geometric coordinates, 
mass means energy. 
If we consider the real function 
f left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction f (v) =
1
/
1 −v2/c2
and the formula of the relativistic mass, we can neglect the upper BB terms because 1 divided by c Superscript 41/c4
modify a given quantity in an irrelevant mode. We may write

Let us deﬁne the kinetic relativistic energy by 
upper E left parenthesis v right parenthesis colon equals StartFraction m 0 c squared Over StartRoot 1 minus v squared divided by c squared EndRoot EndFraction periodE(v) :=
m0c2
/
1 −v2/c2 .
The previous formula becomes 
upper E left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals m 0 c squared plus one half m 0 v squared periodE(v) = m0c2 + 1
2m0v2.
We may call rest energy the formula upper E colon equals m 0 c squaredE := m0c2; it makes sense when m 0 not equals 0m0 /= 0. 
A comment. It is useful, at this point, after the discussion about the relativistic 
mass, saying some words about the light energy which is not00, even if the rest mass 
of photons is00. To understand why, we have to accept the alternative way to consider 
the light as explained by Maxwell equations, that is light is an electromagnetic wave. 
We have also to accept the dual behavior of light and to deﬁne the photon as the 
particle attached to the wave 2. The equation of photon energy is upper E equals h f equals h c divided by lamdaE = h f = hc/λ, 
wherehh is the Planck constant,f f is the photon frequency,lamdaλ is the photon wavelength 
and, of course, cc is the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore, in the case of a photon, 
we have a relativistic equivalent of mass given by the formula upper E divided by c squaredE/c2. 
9.4 
The Maxwell Equations 
The Maxwell equations are the “core” of Special Relativity. Essentially, this theory 
has been developed in view of explaining their invariance under Lorentz transforma-
tions. In order to discuss Maxwell’s equations, which describes the electromagnetic 
ﬁeld, we need some preliminary algebraic result.

Another comment is in order. We know the meaning of nabla squared phi comma∇2φ, where phiφ is a scalar

9.4 The Maxwell Equations
243
This one is the wave equation corresponding to the electric ﬁeld. We have now a 
picture of the electromagnetic ﬁeld described by the Maxwell equations: The two 
waves equations of electric and magnetic ﬁeld are interconnected by the four Maxwell 
equations. We understand that one ﬁeld can not exist without the other. Each one 
generates the other. 
Are these wave equations invariant under Lorentz transformations? The answer 
is yes, but we need to perform more steps in order to achieve these results. 
In the same way as before, for each component upper E Subscript i Baseline comma i element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetEi, i ∈{1, 2, 3}, we have

To continue, let us choose a component only, say i equals 1i = 1. Since for the other two 
components, the following computations are the same, we prefer instead to use upper E 1E1, 
to denote this chosen component by the letter double struck upper EE. The previous equation becomes

Theorem 9.4.5 Galilei’s transformations do not preserve Maxwell’s equations. 
The ﬁnal conclusion is: Classical Mechanics through Galilei’s transformations 
does not preserve Maxwell’s equations while the Special Relativity, through Lorentz 
transformations, does it. 
9.5 
The Doppler Effect in Special Relativity 
We have proved that the speed of light does not depend on the speed of the source 
of light. Let us now focus on the frequency of light signals. We prove that the 
frequency of light signals depends on the speed of the source, that is, we show that 
light frequency is increasing when the source is approaching to the observer upper OO at 
rest in upper RR, then, when the source is moving away, the light frequency is decreasing. 
This is the so called Doppler’s effect or relativistic Doppler’s effect. 
Deﬁnition 9.5.1 Doppler’s effect is a change in frequency of light-wave when a 
source is moving at constant speed with respect to the frequency perceived by an 
observer at rest. 
Therefore we have two different formulas, one to estimate the frequency of the 
source which is approaching, and another one for the frequency in the case when the 
source is moving away. Let us translate this in a mathematical way. 
Consider, as usual, two local frames of geometric coordinates, one moving at 
constant speed vv, denoted by upper SS, and another one considered at rest, denoted by upper RR.
246
9
Special Relativity
The ﬁrst local frameupper SS is described by the coordinatesleft parenthesis tau equals x overbar Superscript 0 Baseline comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ = ¯x0, ¯x3), while the frame 
upper RR is described by the coordinates left parenthesis t equals x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x cubed right parenthesis(t = x0, x3). 
Consider a source of light inupper SS which, for eachDelta tau/τ seconds, releases a light signal. 
If the frequency is denoted bynuν, the connection between the two physical quantities 
is 
nu equals StartFraction 1 Over Delta tau EndFraction periodν =
1
/τ .
This formula is related to the behavior of a light wave. 
The quantity Delta tau/τ is the period of a light wave in the frame upper SS. The light wave, with 
frequency nuν, is imagined as emitted light signals of duration Delta tau/τ seconds. They 
produces light cones with the vertexes on the tauτ-axis. 
So, the source is moving in upper SS along the tauτ-axis and, in upper RR, this  tauτ axis becomes 
the line x cubed equals v tx3 = vt. The observer, at the origin upper OO of upper RR, perceives the source ﬁrst as 
approaching, then as moving away. 
To simplify, let us consider the moment when the two origins are coincident 
and, on thetauτ-axis, we drawDelta tau/τ intervals to the left and to the right. The light cones, 
considered inupper SS, determine two kinds of equal intervalsDelta t/t on thett-axis inupper RR. Until the 
origin, we denote them Delta t Subscript a p p Baseline/tapp, after we denote them by Delta t Subscript m a Baseline/tma, each one determining 
its corresponding frequency inupper RR. The subscripta p papp andm ama are obviously from the 
words “approaching” and “moving away”. 
Therefore, two kinds of frequencies appear in upper RR, that is 
f Subscript a p p Baseline colon equals StartFraction 1 Over Delta t Subscript a p p Baseline EndFraction fapp :=
1
/tapp
and 
f Subscript m a Baseline colon equals StartFraction 1 Over Delta t Subscript m a Baseline EndFraction period fma :=
1
/tma
.
Theorem 9.5.2 According to the above conditions, we have: 
(i). If the source is approaching, 
f Subscript a p p Baseline equals nu StartRoot StartFraction 1 plus v Over 1 minus v EndFraction EndRoot greater than nu period fapp = ν
/
1 + v
1 −v > ν.
(ii). If the source is moving away, 
f Subscript m a Baseline equals nu StartRoot StartFraction 1 minus v Over 1 plus v EndFraction EndRoot less than nu period fma = ν
/
1 −v
1 + v < ν.
Proof Denote by left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0) and left parenthesis b comma v b right parenthesis(b, vb), the coordinates at the ends of the ﬁrst interval 
Delta tau/τ on thetauτ-axis, as seen inupper RR. The light-ray emitted at the pointleft parenthesis b comma v b right parenthesis(b, vb) reaches the 
tt-axis at left parenthesis b plus v b comma 0 right parenthesis(b + vb, 0). Of course, in this case, we used the photon corresponding to 
speed negative 1−1. Therefore 
Delta t Subscript m a Baseline equals b left parenthesis 1 plus v right parenthesis period/tma = b(1 + v).
9.6 Gravity in Special Relativity: The Case of the Constant Gravitational Field
247
Now, consider the points left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(0, 0) and left parenthesis negative b comma minus v b right parenthesis(−b, −vb) as the coordinates of a Delta tau/τ interval 
when the source is approaching. The light-ray emitted at the pointleft parenthesis negative b comma minus v b right parenthesis(−b, −vb) reaches 
the tt-axis at left parenthesis negative b plus v b comma 0 right parenthesis(−b + vb, 0) because we used the photon corresponding to speed 11. In  
this case

Gravity in Special Relativity: The Case of the Constant 
Gravitational Field 
The fact that Special Relativity had to be improved towards General Relativity is 
essentially due to two main reasons: From one side, Einstein, according to the Mach 
criticisms [ 21], realized that the laws of Physics must be written in the same way for 
any (inertial or non-inertial) observer (Invariance Principle ). Secondly, considering 
the gravitational phenomena, he realized that one needs to introduce accelerating 
frames. According to these observations, Special Relativity is inadequate to enclose 
gravity. 
In order to discuss gravity in the framework of Special Relativity and show their 
basic incompatibility, let us begin considering a very simple result. 
In a Minkowski space, for every tt, let v left parenthesis t right parenthesisv(t) be a vector of constant norm. 
It results left angle bracket v left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma v left parenthesis t right parenthesis right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals k period<v(t), v(t)>M = k. If we consider the derivative with respect to tt, we  
obtain 
left angle bracket ModifyingAbove v With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis comma v left parenthesis t right parenthesis right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline equals 0 period <˙v(t), v(t)>M = 0.
We have proved the following

Proposition 9.6.1 (i)The derivative of a constant norm vector is a vector orthogonal 
on the given vector, that is ModifyingAbove v With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis up tack Subscript upper M Baseline v left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙v(t) ⊥M v(t), 
(ii) The vectorsModifyingAbove v With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙v(t) andv left parenthesis t right parenthesisv(t) are Minkowski type different, that is, ifv left parenthesis t right parenthesisv(t) is space-like 
vector, the derivative ModifyingAbove v With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis˙v(t) is time-like vector, and vice versa. 
A second very important observation is this one: 
In a local frameupper SS of coordinatesleft parenthesis tau equals x overbar Superscript 0 Baseline comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ = ¯x0, ¯x3), let us consider an eventupper E left parenthesis tau comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis comma x overbar cubed greater than 0E(τ, ¯x3), ¯x3 >
0. There are only two events on thetauτ-axis, sayupper E 1 left parenthesis tau 1 comma 0 right parenthesisE1(τ1, 0) andupper E 2 left parenthesis tau 2 comma 0 right parenthesisE2(τ2, 0) withtau 1 less than tau 2τ1 < τ2, 
such that the event upper EE is connected to the events upper E 1E1 and upper E 2E2 by light-rays. Indeed, 
considering that the slopes of the linesupper E 1 upper EE1E andupper E 2 upper EE2E have to be11 andnegative 1−1 respectively, 
the connections among the coordinates are 
tau equals StartFraction tau 1 plus tau 2 Over 2 EndFraction semicolon x overbar cubed equals StartFraction tau 2 minus tau 1 Over 2 EndFraction commaτ = τ1 + τ2
2
;
¯x3 = τ2 −τ1
2
,
or equivalently 
tau 1 equals tau minus x overbar cubed semicolon tau 2 equals x overbar cubed plus tau periodτ1 = τ −¯x3; τ2 = ¯x3 + τ.
Therefore we have proved. 
Proposition 9.6.2 Suppose the event upper E left parenthesis tau comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis comma x overbar cubed greater than 0E(τ, ¯x3), ¯x3 > 0 is connecting the events upper E 1E1
and upper E 2E2 by light-rays. If the coordinates are upper E 1 left parenthesis tau 1 comma 0 right parenthesis commaE1(τ1, 0), upper E 2 left parenthesis tau 2 comma 0 right parenthesis comma tau 1 less than tau 2E2(τ2, 0), τ1 < τ2, then, 
between the above coordinates there are the relations 
tau 1 equals tau minus x overbar cubed semicolon tau 2 equals x overbar cubed plus tau periodτ1 = τ −¯x3; τ2 = ¯x3 + τ.
The physical image is the following: a light-ray fromupper E 1E1 reachesupper EE and is reﬂected 
to upper E 2E2. The coordinates are like in the previous proposition.

a constant gravitational ﬁeld exists. This constant gravitational ﬁeld can be imagined 
as a vectorminus ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow−
→α acting along thex overbar cubed¯x3 axis in its negative direction, therefore as a vector 
with the spatial coordinates left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma negative alpha right parenthesis(0, 0, −α). 
Let us consider another frame of coordinates upper RR, whose coordinates are left parenthesis t equals x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(t =
x0, x1, x2, x3). This frame is in free fall in the previous constant gravitational ﬁeld. 
We may assume that, attau equals t equals 0τ = t = 0, the two frames can be seen together with axes 
corresponding in notation of indexes. Let us suppose that the second frameupper RR is mov-
ing along the x overbar cubed¯x3 axis in its negative direction. So, we can think of a transformation 
which describes the constant gravitational ﬁeld inupper SS, involving only the pairs of axis 
left parenthesis tau comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ, ¯x3) of upper SS and left parenthesis t comma x cubed right parenthesis(t, x3) of upper RR. 
To obtain it, we change the perspective: We consider upper RR at rest and the frame upper SS
accelerating along the x cubedx3 axis with the constant acceleration left parenthesis 0 comma alpha right parenthesis period(0, α).
When we determine the Lorentz transformation, our ﬁrst concern is describing 
the tauτ axis in upper RR when upper SS is moving at constant speed vv. The question is: If upper SS is ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow
→α-
accelerating with respect to upper RR, what becomes the tauτ axis of upper SS in upper RR? 
Let us think of a line as a trajectory of a moving point. The speed is constant along 
the line, that is the vector speed of a given line has constant norm; in the same time, 
the acceleration vector is null. If we consider the current point left parenthesis tau comma 0 right parenthesis(τ, 0) on tauτ-axis, the 
speed vector is ModifyingAbove upper V With right arrow equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesis
→
V = (1, 0) and the acceleration vector is ModifyingAbove upper A With right arrow equals left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesis
→
A= (0, 0). Therefore the 
tauτ-axis at rest is characterized by

Looking at the accelerated frame upper SS, the upper RR observer sees a modiﬁed tauτ-axis, denoted 
now

The Doppler Effect in Constant Gravitational Field 
and Consequences 
We know, up to this point, that frames at rest and frames moving at constant speed 
are inertial frames. The laws of mechanics and the new laws of Special Relativity 
have the same form and hold in such frames. There are no evidences that frames 
in which acts a constant gravitational ﬁeld are non-inertial frames. Are they really 
inertial frames? The answer is related to the Doppler effect in a constant gravitational 
ﬁeld. 
We are interested in ﬁnding out how the frequency of light inupper SS is affected by the 
constant gravitational ﬁeld minus ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow−
→α which acts in upper SS. 
To obtain a formula which connects the frequency of the light andminus ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow−
→α, we need 
to change the perspective as we have done before. We use two frames of coordinates 
upper SS andupper RR. Instead of looking at the frame of coordinatesupper RR in free fall in the previous 
constant gravitational ﬁeld, we look atupper RR at rest and at the frameupper SS accelerated along 
the x cubedx3 axis with the constant acceleration ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow
→α. 
Our study is done again in the two corresponding slices of upper SS and upper RR, taking into 
account the coordinates left parenthesis tau equals x overbar Superscript 0 Baseline comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ = ¯x0, ¯x3), respectively left parenthesis t equals x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x cubed right parenthesis(t = x0, x3). 
Let us pose the problem. 
From the originupper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0) ofupper SS is emitted a light signal with frequencynuν. Consider 
upper C left parenthesis 0 comma h right parenthesisC(0, h), a point on x overbar cubed¯x3 axis at height hh. The  level hh is reached by the light-ray at the 
point upper H left parenthesis h comma h right parenthesisH(h, h). In order to obtain the frequency at the level hh, we need to consider
9.6 Gravity in Special Relativity: The Case of the Constant Gravitational Field

the frame upper RR. Denote by f Subscript h fh the frequency of the light-ray in upper RR corresponding to the

the corresponding period in upper SS, and by

the cooresponding period inupper RR, we obtain a formula connecting the two periods, that 
is 
Delta tau equals e Superscript minus alpha h Baseline Delta t period/τ = e−αh/t.
If h greater than 0h > 0, that is, if the point upper CC belongs to the upper half-plane of upper SS, comparing the 
periods in upper SS with the one in upper RR, we have  
Delta tau less than Delta t period/τ < /t.
If h less than 0h < 0, that is if the point upper CC is in the complementary half-plane of upper SS, we have  
Delta tau greater than Delta t period/τ > /t.
If hh is very close to 00, we may consider the approximation 
e Superscript minus alpha h Baseline equals 1 minus alpha h periode−αh = 1 −αh.
From a physical point of view, minus alpha h−αh corresponds to a potential energy for an object 
whose mass is 11. Therefore we can write the formula 
Delta t equals StartFraction 1 Over 1 minus alpha h EndFraction Delta tau/t =
1
1 −αh /τ
written with respect to the potential energy. 
Now, let us take into account two clocks, one inupper OO and one inupper CC. Suppose the ﬁrst 
one ticking at each Delta tau/τ seconds. The second clock at upper CC is ticking in Delta t/t seconds. 
The results Delta tau less than Delta t/τ < /t if h greater than 0h > 0 and Delta tau greater than Delta t/τ > /t, if h less than 0h < 0 hold. 
This situation shows that upper SS cannot be an inertial reference frame. In an inertial 
reference frame, the position cannot affect the way in which time is running. In the 
entire frame upper SS, we should have a same result. 
Therefore we have. 
Corollary 9.6.7 The frames in which a constant gravitational ﬁeld is acting are not 
inertial frames. 
A further remark is the following. Let us suppose we are on the surface of a 
planet. Consider0 less than h 1 less than h 20 < h1 < h2. It resultsminus alpha h 1 greater than minus alpha h 2−αh1 > −αh2, that is1 minus alpha h 1 greater than 1 minus alpha h 21 −αh1 > 1 −αh2. 
Suppose thath 1 comma h 2h1, h2 are so small than the quantities1 minus alpha h 11 −αh1 and1 minus alpha h 21 −αh2 are positive. 
We obtain

slower and slower, that is the gravity slows down the clocks. This effect is taken into

Bending of Light-Rays in a Constant Gravitational

Theorem 9.6.8 The light-rays are bending in a constant gravitational ﬁeld minus ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow−

Proof The main idea of the proof that the light is bending in a constant gravitational 
ﬁeld is related to the fact that the projection of a line to a plane is a line or a point. For 
the proof, the trajectory of a photon included in a given plane, in our case x cubed equals StartFraction 1 Over alpha EndFractionx3 = 1

is transferred into the frame of coordinates left parenthesis tau equals x overbar Superscript 0 Baseline comma x overbar squared comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(τ = ¯x0, ¯x2, ¯x3) and then it is projected 
to the plane left parenthesis x overbar squared comma x overbar cubed right parenthesis(¯x2, ¯x3). The result is neither a line nor a point. Therefore the light-ray 
is bent by the constant gravitational ﬁeld.

The Basic Incompatibility Between Gravity and Special 
Relativity 
We can conclude this chapter pointing out the basic incompatibility between gravity 
and Special Relativity. 
Let us suppose we are in a local frameupper SS, where a constant gravitational ﬁeldminus ModifyingAbove alpha With right arrow−
→α
is acting and let us consider a photon emitted at the origin upper OO from a source moving 
along the tauτ-axis. Taking into account the frequency nuν and the formula Delta tau equals StartFraction 1 Over nu EndFraction/τ = 1
ν , the  
next photon is emitted by the source at the point upper A left parenthesis Delta tau comma 0 right parenthesisA(/τ, 0). The frame upper SS is not an 
inertial one and we have proved that the trajectories of photons are bending, that is 
they are not straight lines but curves. This means that there is a speciﬁc curve starting 
at the emitting point of the photon, in our case upper OO, which reaches the line x overbar cubed equals h¯x3 = h at 
a point denoted by upper MM. The second photon, emitted in upper AA has an identical trajectory 
to the one emitted at upper OO. This second trajectory reaches the line x overbar cubed equals h¯x3 = h in a point 
denoted by upper NN. 
The quadrilateral upper O upper A upper N upper MO AN M has the property Delta tau equals upper O upper A equals upper M upper N/τ = O A = M N. The length upper M upper NM N
is the period Delta t/t corresponding to the frequency f Subscript h fh in upper RR. 
We have 
Delta tau equals Delta t comma/τ = /t,
instead of 
Delta tau equals e Superscript minus alpha h Baseline Delta t period/τ = e−αh/t.
This contradiction shows that the gravity cannot be integrated into the frame-
work of Special Relativity. Another theory has to be developed in order to ﬁx this 
shortcoming. This is General Relativity.

Isaac Newton: Dear Prof. Einstein, my Universe is very simple. I can describe it 
using vectors and calculus. Between any two objects, a gravitational force is acting 
and, according to the masses of objects and the distance between them, the gravita-

Starting from them, I can recover the Laplace and Poisson equations in the weak

that the better description of my theory can be reduced to the sentence “Space-time

In the left-hand side, we have the “Geometry”: Metric g Subscript i jgi j and its derivatives are

energy-momentum tensor. Once we have a metric g Subscript i jgi j, according to the Equivalence 
Principle, we have also the geodesics of the metric as we will discuss below. Which 
is the meaning of the geodesics described by the equations

The simplest answers is: They are trajectories of objects moving accordingly to the

We start this chapter with some general considerations on what a good theory of 
gravity should do and enunciating the basic principles on which General Relativity 
lies. After, we take into account the differences between the Classical Newtonian 
Mechanics and the Einstein picture of gravity based on Geometry. We discuss how it 
works looking at the differences between the constant gravitational ﬁeld, as conceived 
in Classical Mechanics, and the General Relativity counterpart. Finally, we provide 
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations from the Einstein-Hilbert variational principle and brieﬂy 
discuss possible generalizations like the so called f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) gravity.
10.1 What is a Good Theory of Gravity?
259
The Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein vacuum ﬁeld equations is presented. 
The orbits of planets and the bending of light rays are computed in the framework 
of Schwarzschild metric. Even if it does not verify the ﬁeld equations, the Einstein 
metric is presented because Einstein used it to compute the orbits of planets and the 
bending of light rays. The full computation for the perihelion drift is presented. The 
same, in both metrics, is presented the bending of light rays passing near our Sun. 
Fermi’s viewpoint on Einstein’s vacuum ﬁeld equations is presented with impli-
cations related to the study of the week gravitational ﬁeld; the classical counterparts 
of the relativistic equations are obtained in this way. We analyze Einstein static uni-
verse and the basic considerations on the cosmological constant, as a part related 
to the standard approach to the General Relativity. A “cosmological metric” is 
discussed when we study the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metrics of a 
Universe in expansion. The way we obtain it is related to the way we considered the 
energy-momentum tensor. An interesting introductory section devoted to black holes 
mathematics is also presented. To have a more complete view on Relativity, we offer 
a short introduction on cosmic strings, wormholes and gravitational waves. 
Particular hypothetical universes without global time coordinate, as Gödel’s one 
and without masses, as de Sitter one and not only these, are presented to enlarge the 
possibilities of solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. 
This is the most important chapter of the book. The main references for the topics 
we are developing can be found in [ 40, 44, 46, 56, 58, 75, 77, 137, 141, 142, 154, 
157, 163, 169, 171, 176]. 
10.1 
What is a Good Theory of Gravity? 
Before entering the details of General Relativity, some considerations are in order. 
We need them to discuss the change of perspective introduced by the Einstein theory. 
As it is well known, General Relativity is based on the fundamental assumption 
that space and time are entangled into a single space-time structure assigned on a 
pseudo-Riemann manifold. Being a dynamical structure, it has to reproduce, in the 
absence of gravitational ﬁeld, the Minkowski space-time. 
General Relativity has to match some minimal requirements to be considered 
a self-consistent physical theory. First of all, it has to reproduce the Newtonian 
dynamics in the weak-energy limit, hence it must be able to explain the astronomical 
dynamics related to the orbits of planets and the self-gravitating structures. Moreover, 
it passed some observational tests in the Solar System that constitute its experimental 
foundation [196]. 
However, General Relativity should be able to explain the Galactic dynamics, 
taking into account the observed baryonic constituents (e.g. luminous components 
as stars, sub-luminous components as planets, dust and gas), radiation and Newto-
nian potential which is, by assumption, extrapolated to Galactic scales. Besides, it 
should address the problem of large-scale structure as the clustering of galaxies. On 
cosmological scales, it should address the dynamics of the Universe, which means
260
10
General Relativity and Relativistic Cosmology
to reproduce the cosmological parameters as the expansion rate, the density param-
eter, and so on, in a self-consistent way. Observations and experiments, essentially, 
probe the standard baryonic matter, the radiation, and an attractive overall interaction, 
acting at all scales and depending on distance: this interaction is gravity. 
In particular, Einstein’s General Relativity is based on four main assumptions. 
They are 
The “Relativity Principle” - there is no preferred inertial frames, i.e. all frames are good 
frames for Physics. 
The “Equivalence Principle” - inertial effects are locally indistinguishable from gravitational 
effects (which means the equivalence between the inertial and the gravitational masses). In 
other words, any gravitational ﬁeld can be locally cancelled. 
The “General Covariance Principle” - ﬁeld equations must be “covariant” in form, i.e. they 
must be invariant in form under the action of space-time diffeomorphisms. 
The “Causality Principle” - each point of space-time has to admit a universally valid notion 
of past, present and future. 
On these bases, Einstein postulated that, in a four-dimensional space-time manifold, 
the gravitational ﬁeld is described in terms of the metric tensor ﬁeldd s squared equals g Subscript i j Baseline d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript jds2 = gi jdxidx j, 
with the same signature of Minkowski metric. The metric coefﬁcients have the phys-
ical meaning of gravitational potentials. Moreover, he postulated that space-time is 
curved by the distribution of the energy–matter sources. 
The above principles require that the space-time structure has to be determined 
by either one or both of the two following ﬁelds: a Lorentzian metric gg and a linear 
connection normal upper GammaT, assumed by Einstein to be torsionless. The metric gg ﬁxes the causal 
structure of space-time (the light cones) as well as its metric relations (clocks and 
rods); the connectionnormal upper GammaT ﬁxes the free fall, i.e. the locally inertial observers. They have, 
of course, to satisfy a number of compatibility relations which amount to require that 
photons follow null geodesics of normal upper GammaT, so that normal upper GammaT and gg can be independent, a priori, 
but constrained, a posteriori, by some physical restrictions. These, however, do not 
impose that normal upper GammaT has necessarily to be the Levi-Civita connection of gg. 
It should be mentioned, however, that there are many shortcomings in General 
Relativity, both from a theoretical point of view (non-renormalizability, the presence 
of singularities, and so on), and from an observational point of view. The latter indeed 
clearly shows that General Relativity is no longer capable of addressing Galactic, 
extra-galactic, and cosmic dynamics, unless the source side of ﬁeld equations con-
tains some exotic form of matter–energy. These new elusive ingredients, as mentioned 
above, are usually addressed as “dark matter” and dark energy and constitute up to 
the 95 percent sign95% of the total cosmological amount of matter–energy [52]. 
On the other hand, instead of changing the source side of the Einstein ﬁeld equa-
tions, one can ask for a “geometrical view” to ﬁt the missing matter–energy of the 
observed Universe. In such a case, the dark side could be addressed by extending 
General Relativity including more geometric invariants into the standard Einstein– 
Hilbert Action. Such effective Lagrangians can be easily justiﬁed at fundamental level
10.1 What is a Good Theory of Gravity?
261
by any quantization scheme on curved space-times. However, at present stage of the 
research, this is nothing else but a matter of taste, since no ﬁnal probe discriminat-
ing between dark matter and extended gravity has been found up to now. Finally, the 
bulk of observations that should be considered is so high that an effective Lagrangian 
or a single particle will be difﬁcult to account for the whole phenomenology at all 
astrophysical and cosmic scales. 
10.1.1 
Metric or Connections? 
As we will see below, in the General Relativity formulation, Einstein assumed that 
the metric gg of the space-time is the fundamental object to describe gravity. The 
connectionnormal upper GammaT is constituted by coefﬁcients with no dynamics. Onlygg has dynamics. 
This means that the single objectgg determines, at the same time, the causal structure 
(light cones), the measurements (rods and clocks) and the free fall of test parti-
cles (geodesics). Space-time is therefore a couple StartSet upper M comma g EndSet{M, g} constituted by a pseudo-
Riemannian manifold and a metric. Even if it was clear to Einstein that gravity 
induces freely falling observers and that the Equivalence Principle selects an object 
that cannot be a tensor (the connection normal upper GammaT)—since it can be switched off and set to 
zero at least in a point—he was obliged to choose it (the Levi-Civita connection) as 
being determined by the metric structure itself. 
In the Palatini formalism, a (symmetric) connectionnormal upper GammaT and a metricgg are given and 
varied independently. Space-time is a triple StartSet upper M comma g comma normal upper Gamma EndSet{M, g, T} where the metric determines 
rods and clocks (i.e. it sets the fundamental measurements of space-time) while normal upper GammaT
determines the free fall. In the Palatini formalism, normal upper GammaT are differential equations. The 
fact thatnormal upper GammaT is the Levi-Civita connection ofgg is no longer an assumption but becomes 
an outcome of the ﬁeld equations. 
The connection is the gravitational ﬁeld and, as such, it is the fundamental ﬁeld 
in the Lagrangian. The metric gg enters the Lagrangian with an “ancillary” role. It 
reﬂects the fundamental need to deﬁne lengths and distances, as well as areas and 
volumes. It deﬁnes rods and clocks that we use to make experiments. It deﬁnes also 
the causal structure of space-time. However, it has no dynamical role. There is no 
whatsoever reason to assume gg to be the potential for normal upper GammaT, nor that it has to be a true 
ﬁeld just because it appears in the action. We will not develop any more the Palatini 
formalism in this book. For a detailed discussion see [ 56]. 
10.1.2 
The Role of Equivalence Principle 
The Equivalence Principle is strictly related to the above considerations and could 
play a very relevant role in order to discriminate among theories. In particular, it could 
specify the role of gg and normal upper GammaT selecting between the metric and Palatini formulation of 
gravity. In particular, precise measurements of Equivalence Principle could say us if
262
10
General Relativity and Relativistic Cosmology
normal upper GammaT is only Levi-Civita or a more general connection disentangled, in principle, from 
gg. Before, we discussed the Equivalence Principle starting from the early Galileo 
consideration stating thatm Subscript i Baseline identical to m Subscript gmi ≡mg. Besides this result, in General Relativity, Equiv-
alence Principle states that accelerations can be set to zero in given reference frame. 
According to this result, the free fall along geodesics, given by the connection, is 
ruled by the metric, as we will discuss below. 
Before entering into details, let us discuss some topics related to the Equivalence 
Principle. Summarizing, the relevance of this principle comes from the following 
points: 
• Competing theories of gravity can be discriminated according to the validity of 
Equivalence Principle. 
• Equivalence Principle holds at classical level but it could be violated at quantum 
level. 
• Equivalence Principle allows to investigate independently geodesic and causal 
structure of space-time. 
From a theoretical point of view, Equivalence Principle lies at the physical foundation 
of metric theories of gravity. The ﬁrst formulation of Equivalence Principle comes 
out from the theory of gravitation formulates by Galileo and Newton, i.e. the Weak 
Equivalence Principle (the above Galilean Equivalence Principle) which asserts the 
inertial massm Subscript imi and the gravitational massm Subscript gmg of any physical object are equivalent. 
The Weak Equivalence Principle statement implies that it is impossible to distinguish, 
locally, between the effects of a gravitational ﬁeld from those experienced in uni-
formly accelerated frames using the simple observation of the free-falling particles 
behaviour. 
A generalization of Weak Equivalence Principle claims that Special Relativity is 
locally valid. Einstein realized, after the formulation of Special Relativity, that the 
mass can be reduced to a manifestation of energy and momentum as discussed in 
previous chapter. As a consequence, it is impossible to distinguish between a uniform 
acceleration and an external gravitational ﬁeld, not only for free-falling particles, but 
whatever is the experiment. According to this observation, Einstein Equivalence 
Principle states: 
• The Weak Equivalence Principle is valid. 
• The outcome of any local non-gravitational test experiment is independent of the 
velocity of free-falling apparatus. 
• The outcome of any local non-gravitational test experiment is independent of 
where and when it is performed in the Universe. 
One deﬁnes as “local non-gravitational experiment” an experiment performed in a 
small size of a free-falling laboratory. Immediately, it is possible to realize that the 
gravitational interaction depends on the curvature of space-time, i.e. the postulates 
of any metric theory of gravity have to be satisﬁed. Hence the following statements 
hold:
10.1 What is a Good Theory of Gravity?
263
• Space-time is endowed with a metric g Subscript i jgi j. 
• The world lines of test bodies are geodesics of the metric. 
• In local freely falling frames, called local Lorentz frames, the non-gravitational 
laws of physics are those of Special Relativity. 
One of the predictions of this principle is the gravitational redshift, experimentally 
veriﬁed by Pound and Rebka in 1960 [196]. Notice that gravitational interactions 
are excluded from the Weak Equivalence Principle and the Einstein Equivalence 
Principle. 
In order to classify alternative theories of gravity, the gravitational Weak Equiv-
alence Principle and the Strong Equivalence Principle have to be introduced. On 
the other hand, the Strong Equivalence Principle extends the Einstein Equivalence 
Principle by including all the laws of physics in its terms. That is: 
• Weak Equivalence Principle is valid for self-gravitating bodies as well as for test 
bodies (gravitational weak equivalence principle). 
• The outcome of any local test experiment is independent of the velocity of the 
free-falling apparatus. 
• The outcome of any local test experiment is independent of where and when in 
the Universe it is performed. 
Alternatively, the Einstein Equivalence Principle is recovered from the Strong Equiv-
alence Principle as soon as the gravitational forces are neglected. Many authors claim 
that the only theory coherent with Strong Equivalence Principle is General Relativity. 
A very important issue is the consistency of Equivalence Principle with respect to 
the Quantum Mechanics. General Relativity is not the only theory of gravitation and 
several alternative theories of gravity have been investigated from the 1960s of last 
century. Considering the space-time to be special relativistic at a background level, 
gravitation can be treated as a Lorentz-invariant ﬁeld on the background. Assuming 
the possibility of General Relativity extensions, two different classes of experiments 
can be conceived: 
• Tests for the foundations of gravitational theories considering the various formu-
lations of Equivalence Principle. 
• Tests of metric theories where space-time is a priori endowed with a metric tensor 
and where the Einstein Equivalence Principle is assumed always valid. 
The subtle difference between the two classes of experiments lies on the fact that 
Equivalence Principle can be postulated a priori or, in a certain sense, “recovered” 
from the self-consistency of the theory. What is today clear is that, for several fun-
damental reasons, extra ﬁelds are necessary to describe gravity with respect to the 
other interactions. Such ﬁelds can be scalar ﬁelds or higher order corrections of cur-
vature invariants. For these reasons, two sets of ﬁeld equations can be considered: 
The ﬁrst set couples the gravitational ﬁeld to the non-gravitational contents of the 
Universe, i.e. the matter distribution, the electromagnetic ﬁelds, etc. The second set 
of equations gives the evolution of non-gravitational ﬁelds. Within the framework
264
10
General Relativity and Relativistic Cosmology
of metric theories, these laws depend only on the metric and this is a consequence 
of the Einstein Equivalence Principle. In the case where Einstein ﬁeld equations are 
modiﬁed and matter ﬁeld are minimally coupled with gravity, we are dealing with the 
so-called Jordan frame. In the case where Einstein ﬁeld equations are preserved and 
matter ﬁeld are non-minimally coupled, we are dealing with the so-called Einstein 
frame. Both frames are conformally related but the very ﬁnal issue is to understand 
if passing from one frame to the other (and vice versa) is physically signiﬁcant. 
See [ 56] for details. Clearly, Equivalence Principle plays a fundamental role in this 
discussion. In particular, the question is if it is always valid or it can be violated at 
quantum level. See [ 12, 182, 184]. 
After these preliminary considerations, let us start with the geometric construction 
of General Relativity. However, we recommend the reader to consider again these 
introductory sections after he/she ﬁnishes to read the book because some current 
problems in General Relativity are reported. 
10.2 Gravity Seen Through Geometry in General Relativity 
Even if we repeat some ideas, let us go back to our previous discussion on the 
gravitational potential in Newtonian Mechanics. We start from the tidal acceleration

the Ricci tensor has to be involved in General Relativity ﬁeld equations. It is why 
Einstein, and then Hilbert, considered a way to express the ﬁeld equations through 
the Ricci tensor. 
So, let us repeat their main idea. The gravitational ﬁeld is not constant. There 
are small variations of the gravitational ﬁeld induced by some other bodies or by 
changing the distance rr between bodies. If we are on the surface of the Earth, our 
legs will experience a higher intensity of the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth than our 
head. To understand this, it is enough to look at the formulaupper A equals StartFraction upper G upper M Over r squared EndFractionA = GM
r2 ,upper MM being the 
mass of the Earth,upper GG being the gravitational constant andrr being the radiusupper RR of the 
Earth at the legs level and r equals upper R plus hr = R + h at the level of our head, hh being our height. 
For the same reason, a person at the ﬁrst ﬂoor of a building experiences a greater 
intensity of the gravitational ﬁeld comparing with another person which is at the 33th 
ﬂoor of the same building. The Moon makes ocean tides and we see how these are 
related to the tidal effects. 
If we have tides, mathematically they can be treated under the Newtonian standard,

Einstein had the power to break the standard Newtonian approach, describing 
gravity with the language of Differential Geometry. 
According to Einstein, the components g Subscript i jgi j of a metric d s squared equals g Subscript i j Baseline d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript jds2 = gi jdxidx j play 
the role of gravitational potential upper PhiΦ, which is just one of the potentials in g Subscript i jgi j. The

The ﬁrst question mark seems to be replaced byupper R Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ri j = 0, but we still have to work to 
obtain it. At this moment we know that the second question mark has to be replaced 
by the Einstein ﬁeld equations. Because the meaning of the two ways of conceiving 
the gravity will be clariﬁed latter after we introduce Fermi coordinates. 
Einstein was the ﬁrst who realized that the laws of Nature have to be expressed by 
equations which hold for any system of coordinates, that is, they must be covariant 
with respect to any change of coordinates. 
Taking into account also the discussion of previous sections, Einstein’s Principle 
of General Covariance states: 
The laws of Nature have to be expressed as equalities of different tensors. 
The changes of coordinates become part of the core of General Relativity. Why are 
they so important? They allow us to describe the laws of Nature from the point of 
view of different observers or/and they allow us to describe a new state of a given 
system. 
Let us consider a region of space where the gravitational ﬁeld can be neglected. 
Consider a spacecraft there. Suppose that there are no other forces acting there. 
Therefore all objects are moving on straight lines with constant velocity. The space-
craft does the same. Locally, the space-time system of coordinates left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x0, x1, x2, x3)
can be thought to describe an inertial frame, that is, the local metric tensor is the

This is the parabola seen in the case of constant gravitational ﬁeld in Classical 
Mechanics, that is, the trajectory function of time.

In fact, all sectional curvatures are00, but, in general, the geodesics are not straight 
lines as we saw, they only come from lines of upper RR. 
In simple words, we can say that the constant gravitational ﬁeld bends geodesics 
of space. 
How the constant gravitational ﬁeld affects the proper time can be found out by 
looking at the metrics involved in this description. For the frame upper RR, free falling in 
the constant gravitational ﬁeld negative alpha−α of upper SS, the metric is the Minkowski one, i.e. 
d s squared equals d t squared minus d x squared periodds2 = dt2 −dx2.

The clock ticks in Delta t/t seconds. The constant gravitational ﬁeld induces in upper SS, as we  
saw, the metric 
d s squared equals e Superscript 2 alpha x overbar Baseline left parenthesis d tau squared minus d x overbar squared right parenthesis periodds2 = e2α¯x(dτ 2 −d ¯x2).
Here, the clock ticks in Delta tau/τ seconds. Between the observers of upper RR and upper SS, if  x overbar right arrow 0 comma x overbar greater than 0¯x →
0, ¯x > 0, there is the connection 
Delta t equals e Superscript alpha x overbar Baseline Delta tau greater than or equals left parenthesis 1 plus alpha x overbar right parenthesis Delta tau greater than or equals Delta tau comma/t = eα¯x/τ ≥(1 + α¯x)/τ ≥/τ,
that is, the clock of upper RR ticks slower and slower as x overbar right arrow 0 comma x overbar greater than 0¯x →0, ¯x > 0. 
The clock of a personupper AA at the ground level of a building ticks less than the clock 
of a personupper BB at the 33th ﬂoor. Therefore the ground level personupper AA ages slower than 
the person upper BB. Or, everyone legs are younger than the brain. Of course even at the 
level of lifetime of a person, the effects are imperceptible. 
Therefore, according to Newton, the constant gravitational ﬁeld landscape exists 
in n equals 3n = 3 dimensions. The gravitational ﬁeld is ModifyingAbove upper A With right arrow

A and the gravitational potential upper PhiΦ
is related to it by the formula 
ModifyingAbove upper A With right arrow equals minus white down pointing triangle upper Phi equals left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma negative alpha right parenthesis period

A= −VΦ = (0, 0, −α).
The constant gravitational ﬁeld satisﬁes the vacuum ﬁeld equation 
white down pointing triangle Superscript 2 Baseline upper Phi equals 0 periodV2Φ = 0.
The equations of motion are

Theorem 10.3.6 (Einstein’s ﬁeld equations in presence of matter) If upper VV is a region 
of the Universe containing matter and energy, such that, on its boundary partial differential upper V∂V , the  
variations delta normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript iδTi

where upper KK is a coupling constant. 
Proof (Hilbert) In the previous theorem, we have used an action which describes the 
geometry of space without matter and energy. If we want to describe the geometry of 
a space with matter and energy inside it, the Einstein–Hilbert action has to contain a 
further term, denoted by upper S Subscript upper MSM, depending on the matter–energy distribution in space-

10.4 An Introduction to f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) Gravity 
It is very interesting to observe that the previous theorems can be generalized if 
instead of upper RR we use any smooth function f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) in the Einstein–Hilbert action. In 
this way, we obtain the ﬁeld equations of the so-called f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) gravity. They are  the  
straightforward generalization of Einstein ﬁeld equations and have recently acquired 
a lot of interest in view of solving several problems in cosmology and astrophysics 
(for a comprehensive discussion, see, for example, [ 56]). For example, the model of 
f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis equals upper R plus StartFraction upper R squared Over 6 upper M squared EndFraction f (R) = R + R2
6M2 , where upper MM has the dimension of mass, gives rise to the so-called 
Starobinski inﬂation [175] which gives rise to the accelerated expansion of the early 
Universe capable of addressing several issues of Cosmological Standard Model based 
on General Relativity and Standard Model of Particles [127]. This kind of theories 
can be useful also to address issues related to the late Universe, like recent accelerated 
expansion, often dubbed dark energy epoch [ 53, 57, 149] or astrophysical issues like 
dark matter [ 62]. 
A detailed discussion of these problems is out of the scope of this book but it is 
worth pointing out that they are very active research areas. We refer the interested 
reader to the cited bibliography.
10.4 An Introduction to f (R) Gravity
279
In view of the present discussion, it is interesting to develop how the Einstein 
ﬁeld equations can be generalized in the f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) gravity framework. In particular, it 
is interesting to point out that metric and Palatini’s formalisms give different ﬁeld 
equations that, however, can be related to each other, see [ 64]. 
Taking into account the previous results related to the Einstein ﬁeld equations, 
let us derive here the f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) gravity ﬁeld equations. We shall use the following facts 
proven in the previous section, that is: 
delta StartRoot negative g EndRoot equals minus one half StartRoot negative g EndRoot g Subscript i j Baseline delta g Superscript i j Baseline commaδ√−g = −1

j, R. They are smooth functions, 
that is functions having derivatives of all order everywhere in the domain, here 
upper VV . Therefore, if we assume f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) as a smooth function of upper R left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR(V ), then f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) is a 
smooth function for x element of upper Vx ∈V . If  upper VV is compact and connected region in the Euclidean 
nn-dimensional space, thenupper R left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR(V ) is a compact interval indouble struck upper RR. In other words, the Ricci 
scalarupper R left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR(V )is the image ofupper VV throughupper RR. In particularf comma f Superscript prime Baseline comma period period period f, f ', ...are at least continuous 
functions on a real compact interval, here upper R left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR(V ). The values of f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis comma f prime left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis comma period period period f (R), f '(R), ... are 
in real compact intervals, too. The prime indicates derivative with respect to the Ricci 
scalar upper RR. 
Theorem 10.4.1 If upper VV is a compact and connected region of the universe without 
matter and energy inside it, such that on its boundarypartial differential upper V∂V the variationsdelta normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript iδTi

and f f is a smooth real valued arbitrary function on upper R left parenthesis upper V right parenthesisR(V ), then

is the Schwarzschild solution for an arbitrary constant upper BB. 
Proof Karl Schwarzschild had the intuition to look for a spherically symmetric solu-
tion which describes the relativistic ﬁeld outside of a non-rotating, massive body. This 
was the ﬁrst exact solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations. Instead of the ordinary 
Cartesian coordinates left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline equals c t comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x0 = ct, x1, x2, x3), Schwarzschild used spherical coordi-
nates for the spatial part. The new coordinate system left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline equals c t comma r comma phi comma theta right parenthesis(x0 = ct,r, ϕ, θ) is related to 
the old one by the formulas 
x Superscript 1 Baseline equals r sine phi cosine theta comma x squared equals r sine phi sine theta comma x cubed equals r cosine phi commax1 = r sin ϕ cos θ, x2 = r sin ϕ sin θ, x3 = r cos ϕ,
so then, for the spatial part, it is 
left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared plus left parenthesis d x cubed right parenthesis squared equals d r squared plus r squared d phi squared plus r squared sine squared phi d theta squared period(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 = dr2 + r2dϕ2 + r2 sin2 ϕdθ2.
Far from the source, the solution has to approximate the Minkowski metric 
d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x squared right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x cubed right parenthesis squared periodds2 = (dx0)2 −(dx1)2 −(dx2)2 −(dx3)2.
In fact, the solution has to approximate 
d s squared equals c squared d t squared minus d r squared minus r squared d phi squared minus r squared sine squared phi d theta squared commads2 = c2dt2 −dr2 −r2dϕ2 −r2 sin2 ϕdθ2,
which is the Minkowski metric in spherically spatial coordinates. 1
Therefore, it is natural to think the Schwarzschild metric in the form 
d s squared equals c squared dot e Superscript upper T Baseline d t squared minus left parenthesis e Superscript upper Q Baseline minus 1 right parenthesis d r squared minus d r squared minus r squared d phi squared minus r squared sine squared phi d theta squaredds2 = c2 · eT dt2 −(eQ −1)dr2 −dr2 −r2dϕ2 −r2 sin2 ϕdθ2
whereupper T colon equals upper T left parenthesis r right parenthesisT := T (r),upper Q colon equals upper Q left parenthesis r right parenthesisQ := Q(r) are two real functions that we need to determine from 
the vacuum ﬁeld equations upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ri j = 0. As we previously discussed, both e Superscript upper T Baseline right arrow 1eT →1 and 
e Superscript upper Q Baseline right arrow 1eQ →1 have to go as r right arrow normal infinityr →∞. For the metric 
d s squared equals c squared dot e Superscript upper T Baseline d t squared minus e Superscript upper Q Baseline d r squared minus r squared d phi squared minus r squared sine squared phi d theta squaredds2 = c2 · eT dt2 −eQdr2 −r2dϕ2 −r2 sin2 ϕdθ2
1 This request is an important property that any physical solution has to possess. In fact, very far 
from the source, a gravitational ﬁeld has to go to zero. This means that Minkowski space-time 
has to be recovered. This property is called “asymptotic ﬂatness” and characterizes any physical 
gravitational ﬁeld. It is worth noticing that this feature is fundamental for black hole solutions 
having physical meaning.

The conditions upper R 00 equals 0R00 = 0 and upper R 11 equals 0R11 = 0 determine both upper TT and upper QQ. 
Indeed, e Superscript upper Q minus upper T Baseline upper R 00 plus upper R 11 equals 0eQ−T R00 + R11 = 0 implies upper T prime plus upper Q Superscript prime Baseline equals 0T ' + Q' = 0, that is upper T plus upper QT + Q = constant = kk. 
Thus e Superscript upper T Baseline equals e Superscript negative upper Q Baseline e Superscript keT = e−Qek, i.e. the metric is 
d s squared equals c squared dot e Superscript negative upper Q Baseline e Superscript k Baseline d t squared minus e Superscript upper Q Baseline d r squared minus r squared d phi squared minus r squared sine squared phi d theta squared periodds2 = c2 · e−Qekdt2 −eQdr2 −r2dϕ2 −r2 sin2 ϕdθ2.
If we let t equals e Superscript k divided by 2 Baseline ut = ek/2u, then d t squared equals e Superscript k Baseline d u squareddt2 = ekdu2, and the metric becomes 
d s squared equals c squared dot e Superscript negative upper Q Baseline d u squared minus e Superscript upper Q Baseline d r squared minus r squared d phi squared minus r squared sine squared phi d theta squared periodds2 = c2 · e−Qdu2 −eQdr2 −r2dϕ2 −r2 sin2 ϕdθ2.
So, we may chooseupper T plus upper Q equals 0T + Q = 0, i.e.upper Q equals negative upper TQ = −T . Replacing in the second equation, we 
have

throwed, but after it reaches a maximum altitude it falls down attracted by the Earth. 
Which is the speed necessary such that the ball never return? 
So, the gravitational force acts between the two involved bodies, the Earth and 
the ball. If the ball is at distance rr from the centre of the Earth, we have

Consider, on the surface of the Earth, the escape velocity v Subscript eve. The ball goes higher 
and higher loosing in time its speed. At inﬁnity, its kinetic energy is 00, the  same  for  
the potential energy minus StartFraction upper G upper M m Over r EndFraction−GMm

. This means that, at inﬁnity, the total energy is 00. At  
each point of this rectilinear trajectory, the total energy, which is a constant, has to 
be 00, that is the escape velocity can be computed from the condition

where upper R Subscript upper ERE is the radius of the Earth. If someone replaces the values, the escape 
velocity from the Earth gravitational ﬁeld is almost 11 (km)/(s). 
By deﬁnition, a black hole is a “cosmic body” having the escape velocity greater than c> c, 
wherecc is the speed of light in vacuum. According to the fact that there are no speeds 
greater than the speed of light in vacuum, let us compute how small should be the 
Earth such that v Subscript e Baseline equals cve = c. We obtain 
r equals StartFraction 2 upper G upper M Over c squared EndFraction almost equals StartFraction 2 dot 6.67 dot 10 Superscript negative 11 Baseline 6 dot 10 Superscript 24 Baseline Over 9 dot 10 Superscript 16 Baseline EndFraction almost equals 8.8 left parenthesis normal m normal m right parenthesis periodr = 2GM

≈2 · 6.67 · 10−116 · 1024

≈8.8 (mm).
Therefore, if all the mass of the Earth is concentrated in a sphere with 8.8 (mm) 
radius, the Earth should be a black hole and not even photons can leave its surface. 
Let us see the difference between the Earth, as we know, and the Earth as a black 
hole. We have to compute in both cases the gravitational force exerted to a 1 left parenthesis k g right parenthesis1(kg)
body. 
For the “usual Earth”: 
upper F equals StartFraction 6.67 dot 10 Superscript negative 11 Baseline dot 6 dot 10 Superscript 24 Baseline dot 1 Over left parenthesis 24 dot 10 Superscript 6 Baseline right parenthesis squared EndFraction almost equals 9.8 left parenthesis normal k normal g dot normal m right parenthesis divided by left parenthesis normal s squared right parenthesis almost equals normal gF = 6.67 · 10−11 · 6 · 1024 · 1
(24 · 106)2
≈9.8(kg · m)/(s2) ≈g
where gg is the constant gravitational acceleration as we expected. 
For the “black hole Earth”, we have 
upper F equals StartFraction 6.67 dot 10 Superscript negative 11 Baseline dot 6 dot 10 Superscript 24 Baseline dot 1 Over left parenthesis 8 dot 10 Superscript negative 3 Baseline right parenthesis squared EndFraction almost equals one half dot 10 Superscript 19 Baseline left parenthesis normal k normal g dot normal m right parenthesis divided by left parenthesis normal s squared right parenthesis commaF = 6.67 · 10−11 · 6 · 1024 · 1

that is, a tremendous huge force exerted by the black hole to all the bodies on its 
surface. 
Suppose now the Earth transformed instantaneously into a black hole. Is the Moon 
trajectory affected? This is only a mathematical discussion, of course. Let us look at 
the formula

It is the same in both cases, because rr is measured from the centre of the Earth. We 
deduce that the Moon continues to orbit the black hole Earth such it does now. 
Some other considerations about black holes can be seen when we study them 
using metrics.

The Rindler Metric and Pseudo-Singularities

What is happening with this metric whenx overbar Superscript 1 Baseline right arrow 0¯x1 →0? If we are looking only at the ﬁrst 
term, the ﬁrst coefﬁcient approaches 00. We can think that the metric fails to exist. A 
singularity seems to be highlighted. However, we will show that a suitable change of 
coordinates transforms the Rindler metric into the ordinary Minkowski metric. We 
may conclude that x overbar Superscript 1 Baseline equals 0¯x1 = 0 is not a physical singularity, but a pseudo-singularity (or 
a geometric singularity), that is one which can be removed by a convenient change 
of coordinates.

If we remember the nature of the Schwarzschild metric, the ﬁrst term is positive, 
the other three are negative. If we look at the ﬁrst term in the case of the Sun, if we 
replace the gravitational constant upper GG, upper M equals upper M Subscript s u nM = Msun, the speed of light in vacuum cc and 
r equals r Subscript s u nr = rsun we have 1 minus StartFraction r Subscript s Baseline Over r EndFraction greater than 0 period1 −rs

the ﬁrst two terms of the 
metric have the properties g 00 right arrow 0g00 →0 and g 11 right arrow negative normal infinityg11 →−∞. So, the Schwarzschild metric 
becomes singular. If we computer Subscript srs in the case of our Sun, we ﬁndr Subscript s Baseline almost equals 3 k mrs ≈3km. So, the 
anomaly appears when the entire mass of our Sun is concentrated in a sphere with a 
radius as r Subscript srs. 
Such a sphere is a black hole. The interior of the sphere is called an interior of the 
black hole and it is characterized by the conditionr less than r Subscript sr < rs. The surface of the sphere is 
called the event horizon and it is characterized by the conditionr equals r Subscript sr = rs. The  exterior 
of the black hole is characterized by the condition r greater than r Subscript sr > rs.

the clock is slowed down at maximum; a clock outside the black hole works faster.

are opposite with respect to the standard ones. It results that tt becomes a spatial

However we can prove that the singularity r equals r Subscript sr = rs is in fact a pseudo-singularity. 
First, let us see what is happening to Riemann curvature tensor at r equals r Subscript sr = rs.

10.7 Black Holes: A Mathematical Introduction

Therefore, at the surface of the black hole, that is whenr equals r Subscript sr = rs, the Riemann curvature 
tensor is well deﬁned. The surface of a black hole is not a physical singularity. 
At the surface of a black hole, that is when r equals r Subscript sr = rs, the Kruskal–Szekeres metric 
gives more information than Schwarzschild metric. 
We act only on the ﬁrst two coordinates of the Schwarzschild metric, the other 
two remain unchanged. The Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates look different inside the 
black hole comparing to the case of the exterior of the black hole. 
In the interior of the black hole the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates are

10.7 Black Holes: A Mathematical Introduction
311
Let us discuss now the entropy of a black hole. From the Special Relativity chapter 
we know the following formulas and their meaning: 
upper E equals h f equals h StartFraction c Over lamda EndFraction semicolon upper E equals m c squared periodE = h f = h c
λ; E = mc2.
From this section, we know that the dimension of a black hole is related to its 
Schwarzschild radius r Subscript srs. If a photon is captured by a black hole of mass upper MM and 
energy upper EE, the black hole changes its mass and energy. This fact can be represented 
by the formula 
Delta upper M equals StartFraction Delta upper E Over c squared EndFraction equals StartFraction h Over lamda c EndFraction equals StartFraction h Over r Subscript s Baseline c EndFraction comma/M = /E
c2
= h
λc = h
rsc,
because lamdaλ becomes r Subscript srs. 
But lamda equals r Subscript s Baseline equals StartFraction 2 upper M upper G Over c squared EndFractionλ = rs = 2MG
c2
suggests a variation of the radius described by the formula 
Delta r equals StartFraction 2 Delta upper M upper G Over c squared EndFraction equals StartFraction 2 upper G Over c squared EndFraction Delta upper M equals StartFraction 2 upper G Over c squared EndFraction StartFraction h Over r Subscript s Baseline c EndFraction comma/r = 2/MG
c2
= 2G
c2 /M = 2G
c2
h
rsc,
that is 
r Subscript s Baseline Delta r equals StartFraction 2 upper G h Over c cubed EndFraction periodrs/r = 2Gh
c3 .
It is worth noticing that the right member is a constant. Furthermore, it is easy to see 
that the area of a black hole is the area of a sphere of radius r Subscript srs, 
upper A equals 4 pi r Subscript s Superscript 2 Baseline periodA = 4πr2
s .
The derivative with respect to rr leads to 
StartFraction d upper A Over d r EndFraction equals 8 pi r Subscript s Baseline commad A
dr = 8πrs,
i.e. 
d upper A equals 8 pi r Subscript s Baseline d r equals StartFraction 16 pi upper G h Over c cubed EndFraction periodd A = 8πrsdr = 16πGh
c3
.
Therefore, if a photon is captured by a black hole, the black hole area is increasing 
by the quantity 
d upper A equals StartFraction 16 pi upper G h Over c cubed EndFraction periodd A = 16πGh
c3
.
If d upper SdS is a unitary entropy, the variation of the area becomes 
d upper A equals StartFraction 16 pi upper G h Over c cubed EndFraction d upper S commad A = 16πGh
c3
dS,
312
10
General Relativity and Relativistic Cosmology
therefore 
upper S equals StartFraction c cubed Over 16 pi upper G h EndFraction upper A periodS =
c3
16πGh A.
This formula is known as Bekenstein–Hawking formula for the black hole entropy. 
See [103] for a detailed discussion. 
With these considerations in mind, it is straightforward to deﬁne the black hole 
temperature. The formula which connects the variation of energy, the temperature, 
and the variation in entropy is 
d upper E equals upper T d upper S perioddE = T dS.
If we consider only “one unit” of variation for entropy, i.e. a single photon which 
changes the black hole energy, we have that 
d upper E equals upper T equals StartFraction h c Over lamda EndFraction equals StartFraction h c Over r Subscript s Baseline EndFraction equals StartFraction h c cubed Over 2 upper M upper G EndFraction perioddE = T = hc
λ = hc
rs
=
hc3
2MG .
That is, a single photon changes the temperature of the black hole such that upper TT is 
proportional toStartFraction 1 Over upper M EndFraction 1
M . We deduce that smaller black holes are warmer than the massive 
ones.

The Light Cone in the Schwarzschild Metric 
In Minkowski metric, the trajectories of light rays are determined by the condition 
d s squared equals 0ds2 = 0. Since the Minkowski metric in geometric coordinates is 
d s squared equals left parenthesis d x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis d x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared commads2 = (dx0)2 −(dx1)2,
the previous condition becomes 
x Superscript 0 Baseline equals x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x Superscript 0 Baseline equals minus x Superscript 1 Baseline commax0 = x1, x0 = −x1,
therefore the light cone is highlighted. 
In left parenthesis t comma r right parenthesis(t,r) coordinates, let us consider the 33-plane phi equals 0ϕ = 0 and the corresponding 
Schwarzschild metric in geometric coordinates

In summary, we gave only some main features of black holes but the physics and 
the mathematics of these gravitational systems is extremely reach and deserve to be 
explored in details. Furthermore, after the direct detection of the black hole shadow 
by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, a new era started in this fascinating 
sector of Physics. These gravitational objects, considered only exotic theoretical 
objects until recently, have become an amazing arena for observational astrophysics 
and cosmology.

10.8 Cosmological Solutions of the Einstein Field 
Equations: The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson– 
Walker Models of Universe 
If we intend to ﬁnd a metric for the general Einstein ﬁeld equations describing the 
Universe, we have to consider the fact that the observed Universe appears homoge-
neous and isotropic beyond a given scale according to the Cosmological Principle, 
therefore we have to consider, at the beginning, a spherical symmetry for the cosmic 
space-time. 2
The spatial part has to be as 
d r squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis left parenthesis d theta squared plus sine squared theta d phi squared right parenthesis commadr2 + q2(r)
(
dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)
,
where q left parenthesis r right parenthesisq(r) will be determined, so, we can try with the metric 
d s squared equals d t squared minus a squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis left bracket d r squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis d theta squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis sine squared theta d phi squared right bracketds2 = dt2 −a2(t)
|
dr2 + q2(r)dθ2 + q2(r) sin2 θdφ2|
which introduces a new function a left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) necessary to preserve the spherical symmetry 
of the spatial part of the metric which can, eventually, expand under a homothetic 
transformation. In this way, a left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) becomes an expansion factor of the Universe. We 
will discuss this fact a little bit later. Observe that we are working in geometric 
coordinates, that is c equals 1c = 1. 
Let us search for a left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) and q left parenthesis r right parenthesisq(r) such that the previous metric satisﬁes the Ein-
stein ﬁeld equations. To address the answer, there are three possible forms for q left parenthesis r right parenthesisq(r)
depending on a constant of integration, whilea left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) is determined from Einstein’s ﬁeld 
equations. We prove 
Theorem 10.8.1 The following three metrics

2 From observational surveys, the Universe can be considered homogeneous and isotropic beyond 
scales of the order 100–120 Megaparsecs. See [159] for details. This means that, over these scales, 
no large-scale structure, like clusters or super-clusters of galaxies are detected. According to these 
data, matter density can be considered homogeneously distributed in all directions.

More About FLRW Universes 
In the previous subsection, we saw that the problem to ﬁnd a metric for the general 
Einstein ﬁeld equations describing the Universe started from the fact that the observed 
Universe appears homogeneous and isotropic beyond a given scale, therefore we have 
to consider, at the beginning, a spherical symmetry for the cosmic space-time. 
The spatial part ﬁrst considered there was 
d r squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis left parenthesis d theta squared plus sine squared theta d phi squared right parenthesis commadr2 + q2(r)
(
dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)
,
where q left parenthesis r right parenthesisq(r) will be determined, so, the ﬁrst trial metric was 
d s squared equals d t squared minus a squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis left bracket d r squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis d theta squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis sine squared theta d phi squared right bracket periodds2 = dt2 −a2(t)
|
dr2 + q2(r)dθ2 + q2(r) sin2 θdφ2|
.
The functiona left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) introduced is necessary to preserve the proposed spherical symme-
try of the spatial part of the metric which can, eventually, expand under a homothetic 
transformation. This waya squared left parenthesis t right parenthesisa2(t) becomes an expansion factor of the Universe. We have 
to mention that Friedmann and Lemaître used only the expansion factora squared left parenthesis t right parenthesisa2(t) in the 
front of the spatial part of the metric without to consider the q left parenthesis r right parenthesisq(r) factor described 
above. 
We are working in geometric coordinates, that is, c equals 1c = 1. 
FLRW universes with or without cosmological constant are obtained only if the

where g Superscript i jgi j are the inverse components of the metric tensor matrix which satisﬁes 
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, rho 0ρ0 is the constant density of the ﬂuid, p 0p0 is the constant 
pressure of the ﬂuid, and u Superscript iui are the components left parenthesis u Superscript t Baseline comma v Subscript x Baseline u Superscript t Baseline comma v Subscript y Baseline u Superscript t Baseline comma v Subscript z Baseline u Superscript t Baseline right parenthesis(ut, vxut, vyut, vzut) of the ﬂuid

becauseupper T Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ti j = 0. If we look at the conditiond s squared equals 0ds2 = 0 which gives the structure of the

space-time. 
10.8.3 
The Cosmological Expansion 
This subsection is dedicated to the expansion of the Universe. We saw that Einstein 
Static Universe imposed the existence of a new term in the ﬁelds equations, because 
in a Universe in which the matter is constrained to interact only by gravity, all the 
matter sources will be concentrated in the same region, in contrast with the desired 
Einstein static structure. 
The new term was proposed to establish a repulsive effect to counterweight 
the attractive effect of gravity. However, Einstein discarded the cosmological 
term when Hubble discovered evidences for cosmological expansion. In any case, 
Theorem 10.8.1 suggests that we can obtain an expanding universe even if the cos-
mological constant is not considered. Is Hubble’s law related to the cosmological 
metrics obtained above? The answer is yes! 
Let us describe the Hubble law for recession of galaxies. 
First, we have to mention that Hubble used Doppler’s effect to establish his result 
related to the redshift of distant galaxies. The light in the Universe is produced by 
stars. The hydrogen of stars, in thermonuclear fusion, produces primarily helium 
and energy that radiates in space, some of it in form of light. Hubble considered the 
four lines of the hydrogen light spectrum. For distant galaxies, the same four lines 
of hydrogen spectrum are seen shifted to the right in comparison to normal pattern 
of light decomposition detected in laboratory. Hubble realized that this is a Doppler 
effect and the observed redshift means that the distant galaxies are moving away 
from us. He stated that the redshifts in spectra of distant galaxies are proportional to 
the distance of galaxies from us. The mathematical form is 
upper V equals upper H dot upper D commaV = H · D,
where upper DD is the proper distance from us to the galaxy, upper V colon equals ModifyingAbove upper D With dotV := ˙D is the proper speed 
of the galaxy, and upper HH is a constant called the Hubble constant. The farther away the 
galaxy is, the faster it moves away from us. The entire space, the entire texture of 
the Universe is moving away from us carrying the galaxies in it. 
Alternatively, let us suppose we have a ruler of coordinates marked 
0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 comma period period period0, 1, 2, 3, 4, .... The distance between two consecutive coordinates is denoted 
byaa. The distance measured with this ruler is denoted byupper DD.upper D equals a dot Delta xD = a · /x, whereDelta x/x
is the difference between the coordinates of the chosen points we wish to measure. 
Now, suppose we have a rubber band marked in the same way as our ruler; we 
pin the origin and start to stretch. The coordinate points remain drawn on the rubber
330

band but the distance between them increases. Therefore aa depends on time, it is 
a left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t). The distance upper DD becomes upper D left parenthesis t right parenthesis equals Delta x dot a left parenthesis t right parenthesisD(t) = /x · a(t). We have  
upper V colon equals ModifyingAbove upper D With dot equals Delta x dot ModifyingAbove a With dot periodV := ˙D = /x · ˙a.
This relation can be written as 
upper V dot a equals a dot Delta x dot ModifyingAbove a With dot equals upper D dot ModifyingAbove a With dot commaV · a = a · /x · ˙a = D · ˙a,
that is, 
upper V equals StartFraction ModifyingAbove a With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis Over a left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndFraction upper D periodV = ˙a(t)
a(t) D.
We deﬁne upper H colon equals StartFraction ModifyingAbove a With dot left parenthesis t right parenthesis Over a left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndFractionH := ˙a(t)
a(t) and obtain Hubble’s law 
upper V equals upper H dot upper D periodV = H · D.
What is new in this approach is the fact that it is suggested the stretch of the texture of 
the universe. Such a stretch was seen in Sect. 9.9 when we discussed about a possible 
metric for the Cosmos. The metric proposed was 
d s squared equals c squared d t squared minus a squared left parenthesis t right parenthesis left bracket d r squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis d theta squared plus q squared left parenthesis r right parenthesis sine squared theta d phi squared right bracket commads2 = c2dt2 −a2(t)

whereq left parenthesis t right parenthesisq(t) anda left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) were determined from the general Einstein ﬁeld equations under 
some conditions imposed by the energy–momentum tensor upper T Subscript i jTi j. 
The differential equation fora left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t) will be found now under some physical conditions 
and important consequences will come out. 
Consider two galaxies in the Universe such that the distance between them is upper DD. 
Let us consider one of them and the sphere of radiusupper DD centred at the chosen galaxy. 
Denote by upper MM the total mass of galaxies inside the sphere and by mm the mass of the 
second galaxy. This galaxy moves away from the galaxy at the centre of the sphere 
with speed upper V equals upper H dot upper DV = H · D. The gravitational force which acts on the galaxy of mass mm
is

Thanks to the Equivalence Principle, we can divide by mm and then it results

Some remarks are in order now.upper M equals upper V o l times d e n s i t yM = V ol × density. If the volume increases when

decreases. Since

tt, upper KK is such that the right member becomes negative at a point, this Universe will 
increase until that point; then it can remain unchanged or even it can contract. This 
kind of Universe is called a spatially closed universe. If upper K equals 0K = 0, the universe will be 
called a spatially ﬂat Universe. This Universe expands too. In such a Universe there 
is a perfect balance between the kinetic and the potential energy. 
The observational evidences show that our Universe is a ﬂat one. So, it remains

and the temperature at which the atoms can form is less than3 times 10 cubed3 × 103 K degrees. Now, 
the today cosmic background radiation has approximatively33K degrees. Therefore,

about 3 times 10 Superscript 53 × 105 years after Big Bang. It means that the Universe was radiation dom-
inated for almost 3 times 10 Superscript 53 × 105 years. More precisely, it takes about 3 times 10 Superscript 53 × 105 years for 
the Universe, expanding and cooling after Big Bang, to allow electrons and protons 
to couple and form neutral atoms. At this point, even the photons are free to move 
and get to us, providing us with the ﬁrst “photograph” of the Universe that can be 
obtained, that is, the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. 3 Clearly, this is only 
a rough calculation to derive the order of magnitudes. For a detailed discussion on 
primordial Universe phenomenology, see [158, 159]. 
We are now ready to understand some basic facts about dark energy and the 
pressure exerted to expand our Universe. Speciﬁcally, dark energy is the hypothetical 
ﬂuid fueling the observed accelerated expansion revealed at the end of twentieth 
century [ 13]. Let us begin by analysing the pressure exerted on the faces of a cube 
imagined in our Universe. Obviously, there is no pressure in a matter-dominated 
Universe because the galaxies inside the cube do not exert any pressure on the faces 
of the cube. 
In a radiation-dominated universe, it is possible to study the pressure in the fol-
lowing way. Let us consider a photon which can move between “the extremities” of 
a segment line of length upper LL. The small amount of time necessary to move between 
the extremities can be denoted as d tdt and we have the formula d t equals StartFraction 2 upper L Over c EndFractiondt = 2L
c . The force 
which produces the pressure on the extremities is 
upper F equals StartFraction d p Over d t EndFraction equals StartStartFraction 2 p OverOver StartFraction 2 upper L Over c EndFraction EndEndFraction equals StartFraction p c Over upper L EndFraction equals StartFraction upper E Over upper L EndFraction periodF = dp

If we denote byupper LL the length of the side of a cube in a radiation-dominated Universe 
and by d upper Ad A the inﬁnitesimal area of a square drawn on a face (the sides parallel to 
the sides of the face), now corresponding to the perpendicular direction on the given 
face, we have 
upper P equals StartFraction upper F Over d upper A EndFraction equals StartFraction upper E Over upper L d upper A EndFraction periodP = F
d A =

Therefore the pressureupper PP exerted can be though as the ratio between the energy and a 
volume corresponding tod upper Ad A and the above-mentioned perpendicular direction, that 
is, an energy density rhoρ. In fact we have 
upper P equals w rho commaP = wρ,
where w equals 0w = 0 in the case of matter-dominated Universe and w equals one thirdw = 1
3 in an radiation-
dominated Universe; 33 appears because we have three perpendicular direction on 
faces. 
These numbers represent two possibilities for the equation of state of a standard 
perfect ﬂuid where0 less than or equals w less than or equals 10 ≤w ≤1 is the so-called Zel’dovich interval [199]. Beingw equals left parenthesis StartFraction c Subscript s Baseline Over c EndFraction right parenthesis squaredw =
( cs
c
)2, with c Subscript scs the sound speed, the ﬂuids in the Zel’dovich interval agree with the 
causality condition implying that the speed of light has to bec greater than c Subscript sc > cs. In other words, 
standard matter cannot be constituted by tachyons, that is, particles faster than light. 
Suppose now that the pressure expands the cosmic cube of ad upper VdV volume. Taking 
into account the work done by the force upper FF, upper F dot d equals upper P dot upper A dot d equals upper P dot d upper VF · d = P · A · d = P · dV , and the 
variation of the energy upper EE, we have  
d upper E equals negative upper P dot d upper V perioddE = −P · dV.
At the same time, 
upper E equals rho dot upper V periodE = ρ · V.
It results in 
d upper E equals d rho dot upper V plus rho dot d upper V equals negative upper P dot d upper V commadE = dρ · V + ρ · dV = −P · dV,
i.e. 
upper V dot d rho equals minus left parenthesis upper P plus w right parenthesis d upper V equals minus rho left parenthesis w plus 1 right parenthesis d upper V periodV · dρ = −(P + w)dV = −ρ(w + 1)dV.
We have obtained the differential equation

where upper NN is a constant. 
Forw equals 0w = 0, we obtain the formula corresponding to a matter-dominated Universe, 
while for w equals one thirdw = 1
3 we obtain the formula of a radiation-dominated Universe.

w equals negative 1w = −1 is clearly out of the above Zel’dovich interval, i.e. it is not a standard perfect 
ﬂuid, and corresponds to “something” which determines the exponential accelerated 
expansion. Such an expansion is in agreement with the existence of a possible cos-
mological constant normal upper LamdaV (that is, rho 0ρ0). This “something” manifests itself as a pressure 
implying an energy density. As said, this energy is neither produced by the ordinary 
matter nor by the radiation. 5 This is a simple example of dark energy that gives rise 
to accelerated expansion. The mechanism can work both in early Universe, giving 
rise to inﬂation, and in late Universe, giving the observed accelerated expansion of 
the Hubble ﬂow. Clearly the scales of energy are completely different and between 
inﬂation and recent accelerated epoch there are radiation- and matter-dominated eras. 
It is worth noticing that, according to data, the dark energy constitutestilde∼70% of the 
total amount of matter–energy content of the Universe [ 13]. Understanding nature 
and dynamics of dark energy is one of the main challenges of modern cosmology.

Since the age of the Universe is upper A Subscript upper U Baseline equals StartFraction 1 Over upper H EndFractionAU = 1

Now, let us give a “sketch” on how the radius of the observable Universe can 
be computed. When we are talking about the radius of the observable Universe, 
we are taking into consideration the facts explained in the previous sections. In 
principle, a primordial photon can travel to reach our eye from 13 comma 813, 8 billions years. 
According to the Hubble law, the texture of the Universe is in continuous expansion. 
Therefore, to establish the distance crossed by the photon it is not enough to multiply 
the time, i.e. the age of this Universe, by the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore a 
formula asupper R equals upper C dot upper A Subscript upper U Baseline equals c dot d tR = C · AU = c · dt will not describe the exact value of the radiusupper R Subscript upper ORO of 
our observable Universe. We need to take into account the “expansion factor”. The 
expansion factor is 
a left parenthesis t right parenthesis colon equals StartFraction d x left parenthesis t right parenthesis Over d x left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis EndFraction perioda(t) := dx(t)
dx(t0).
Heret 0 colon equals 13 comma 8 upper B yt0 := 13, 8By andd x left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesisdx(t0) is the variation of the real distance crossed by photon 
in t 0t0 years. We obtain 
d x left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis equals StartFraction d x left parenthesis t right parenthesis Over a left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndFraction equals StartFraction c d t Over a left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndFraction commadx(t0) = dx(t)
a(t) = cdt

therefore, for a chosen a left parenthesis t right parenthesisa(t), we have  
upper R Subscript upper O Baseline equals integral Subscript 0 Superscript t 0 Baseline d x left parenthesis t 0 right parenthesis equals integral Subscript 0 Superscript t 0 Baseline StartFraction c Over a left parenthesis t right parenthesis EndFraction d t almost equals 46 normal upper B normal l normal y periodRO =

Therefore, this leads to the unrealistic radius of the observable Universe of4646 billion 
light years. 
Now we can imagine the 3 upper D3D spatial part of the observable Universe as a sphere 
with the radius upper R Subscript upper ORO. The volume of this observable Universe is 
upper V o l Subscript upper U Baseline equals 4 divided by 3 pi upper R Subscript upper O Superscript 3 Baseline almost equals 5 dot 10 Superscript 80 Baseline left parenthesis normal m right parenthesis cubed periodV olU = 4/3π R3
O ≈5 · 1080(m)3.
The real value has 3,566 instead of 55, but this value was obtained both because our 
simpliﬁed value of speed of light in vacuum and our approximations. 
The mass of the observable Universe can be computed thinking at the escape 
velocity formula seen in the black hole section. In this case, we have to think about 
a galaxy escaping from our observable Universe. In the formula seen there, 
one half backslash cancelspssps m v squared equals StartFraction upper G upper M backslash cancelspssps m Over upper R EndFraction comma1

the mass mm of the escaping galaxy is cancelled. upper MM becomes the mass of all the 
observable Universe, upper GG is the gravitational constant, upper RR must be the radius of the 
observable Universe, upper R Subscript upper ORO, and the escape velocity must be the speed of light, cc. It  
results in 
upper M equals StartFraction c squared upper R Subscript upper O Baseline Over 2 upper G EndFraction periodM = c2RO
2G .
Replacing the values, we obtain the mass of the observable Universe,upper M almost equals 10 Superscript 53 Baseline left parenthesis normal upper K normal g right parenthesisM ≈1053(Kg). 
The density of the observable Universe is computed using the formula 
rho Subscript upper U Baseline equals StartFraction upper M Over upper V o l Subscript upper U Baseline EndFraction periodρU =

The value of this density is almost equals 2 dot 10 Superscript negative 28 Baseline StartFraction left parenthesis normal upper K normal g right parenthesis Over left parenthesis normal m right parenthesis cubed EndFraction≈2 · 10−28 (Kg)

This means about 1010 protons per each cubic metre of space. 
The above calculations give a rough image of some basic observables of our 
Universe. Clearly, they have to be confronted with data and some results can be 
completely different. This fact points out that more details on cosmological dynamics 
are needed.

10.10 The Fermi Coordinates 
After the above summary on cosmological expansion, let us deﬁne a system of 
coordinates very useful to describe the geodesic motion. From a mathematical point 
of view, Fermi’s coordinates are local coordinates adapted to a geodesic, that is, at 
a given pointupper PP on a geodesicc left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ), there exists a local system of coordinates around 
upper PP such that: 
• the geodesic locally becomes left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma 0 comma 0 comma period period comma 0 right parenthesis(x0, 0, 0, .., 0); 
• the metric tensor along geodesic is the Minkowski metric (or the Euclidean metric; 
it depends on the context); 
• all the Christoffel symbols vanish along geodesic. 
A nice treatment of this subject 6 and its applications can be seen in [ 46, 137]. 
In our context, we intend to describe the topic in a simpliﬁed way. 
Consider a coordinate frame at rest denoted by upper R colon left parenthesis y Superscript 0 Baseline comma y Superscript 1 Baseline comma y squared comma y cubed right parenthesisR : (y0, y1, y2, y3) together with 
a given metric d s squared equals g overbar Subscript i j Baseline d y Superscript i Baseline d y Superscript jds2 = ¯gi jdyidy j. 
We intend to describe the free fall of an observer upper FF in the gravitational ﬁeld 
induced by g overbar Subscript i j¯gi j. 
1. In the coordinate frame at rest, upper RR, the freely falling observer upper FF is moving on a 
geodesic of the metric d s squared equals g overbar Subscript i j Baseline d y Superscript i Baseline d y Superscript jds2 = ¯gi jdyidy j, say c left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ). 
The geodesic equations of c left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ) are StartFraction d squared y Superscript i Baseline Over d tau squared EndFraction plus normal upper Gamma overbar Subscript j k Superscript i Baseline StartFraction d y Superscript j Baseline Over d tau EndFraction StartFraction d y Superscript k Baseline Over d tau EndFraction equals 0d2yi
dτ 2 + ¯Ti
jk
dy j
dτ

dτ = 0. 
This geodesic is the world line of upper FF in upper RR. 
2. Fromupper FF point of view, there is no ﬁeld. Considerupper FF in a spacecraft, somewhere in 
an almost empty region of the space. That is, to describe the free falling, means 
to create a coordinate frame upper F colon left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesisF : (x0, x1, x2, x3) such that, along the world line 
of upper FF in upper RR in these coordinates, we have normal upper Gamma Subscript j k Superscript i Baseline equals 0Ti
jk = 0. For  upper FF, the geodesic equations 
become StartFraction d squared x Superscript i Baseline Over d tau squared EndFraction equals 0d2xi
dτ 2 = 0, that is, upper FF should move on a straight line. 
We make the assumption: Let x Superscript 0x0-axis be the world line of upper FF in upper RR. 
3. Now, more clearly, we have to construct a map upper M colon upper F right arrow upper RM : F →R which transfers x Superscript 0x0-
axis into the geodesicc left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ), in such a way that thex Superscript 0x0-axis becomes a geodesic in 
upper FF endowed with the metric g Subscript i j Baseline equals d upper M Subscript x Superscript t Baseline dot g overbar Subscript i j Baseline dot d upper M Subscript xgi j = dMt
x · ¯gi j · dMx. 
Therefore, upper MM maps the x Superscript 0x0-axis into the image of the geodesic c left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ). 
If tauτ is the geodesic parameter for the curve c left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ), we can consider the same 
parameter for the x Superscript 0x0-axis, i.e. x Superscript 0 Baseline equals taux0 = τ is the current coordinate of this axis. 
At each point tauτ, we have  
c left parenthesis tau right parenthesis equals left parenthesis y Superscript 0 Baseline left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma y Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma y squared left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma y cubed left parenthesis tau right parenthesis right parenthesis element of upper R commac(τ) = (y0(τ), y1(τ), y2(τ), y3(τ)) ∈R,
6 It is interesting saying that the paper reporting these results was the ﬁrst one written by Enrico 
Fermi when he was student at Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa [101]. 
10.10 The Fermi Coordinates

therefore the map upper M colon upper F right arrow upper RM : F →R gives rise to 
left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis right arrow left parenthesis y Superscript 0 Baseline left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis comma y Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis comma y squared left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis comma y cubed left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesis comma(x0, 0, 0, 0) →(y0(x0), y1(x0), y2(x0), y3(x0)),
where left parenthesis y Superscript 0 Baseline left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis comma y Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis comma y squared left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis comma y cubed left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis right parenthesis(y0(x0), y1(x0), y2(x0), y3(x0)) are the coordinates of the points of the 
geodesic in upper RR. Therefore our transformation upper M colon upper F right arrow upper RM : F →R can be thought 
left parenthesis tau comma 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis right arrow c left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma(τ, 0, 0, 0) →c(τ),
with some considerations on the functions y Superscript kyk we need to describe. 
Let us keep in our mind that we are interested in transferring the property “c is a  
geodesic in upper RR” to the x Superscript 0x0-axis in upper FF. So, we have 
Lemma 10.10.1 Along the geodesic cc in upper RR, it can be highlighted an orthonormal 
frame with respect to the metricg overbar Subscript i j¯gi j whose time-like vector is the tangent vectorStartFraction d c Over d tau EndFraction dc

is a time-like unit vector. We denote it bye 0 left parenthesis tau right parenthesis periode0(τ). We 
know that e 0 left parenthesis tau right parenthesise0(τ) is parallel transported along the geodesic cc in upper RR preserving all its 
properties. 
Consider the point corresponding to tau equals 0τ = 0, that is, the point c left parenthesis 0 right parenthesisc(0) on the 
geodesic. We choose the spatial vectors e 1 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma e 2 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma e 3 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesise1(0), e2(0), e3(0) such that the frame 
StartSet e 0 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma e 1 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma e 2 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis comma e 3 left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis EndSet{e0(0), e1(0), e2(0), e3(0)} is orthonormal with respect to the metricg overbar Subscript i j¯gi j and we par-
allel transport it along the geodesic cc. 
At each point c left parenthesis tau right parenthesisc(τ), the vectors StartSet e 0 left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma e 1 left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma e 2 left parenthesis tau right parenthesis comma e 3 left parenthesis tau right parenthesis EndSet{e0(τ), e1(τ), e2(τ), e3(τ)} form an orthonormal 
frame with respect to the metric g overbar Subscript i j¯gi j.

Lemma 10.10.2 Every point left parenthesis x Superscript 0 Baseline comma x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x0, x1, x2, x3) in upper FF can be uniquely described in the

whose most important property is its null divergence expressed in terms of covariant

upper T Subscript semicolon l Superscript k l Baseline equals 0 periodT kl

This property means that “at each moment, the quantity of matter and energy in the 
interior of a given inﬁnitesimal parallelepiped is constant”. 
A ﬁrst example of energy–momentum tensor was related to the Friedmann– 
Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric of the Universe. In fact, the key point in the 
computations of the metric in geometric coordinates was related to the chosen form 
of energy–momentum tensor. Physicists proposed to look at galaxies as molecules 
of an ideal gas. In this case, the contravariant energy–momentum tensor was 
upper T Superscript i j Baseline equals left parenthesis rho plus p right parenthesis u Superscript i Baseline u Superscript j Baseline minus p g Superscript i j Baseline commaT i j = (ρ + p)uiu j −pgi j,
where g Superscript i jgi j are the inverse components of the metric tensor matrix which satisﬁes

The previous 
null divergence property is obviously recovered. 
Energy and matter can be seen in different ways according to physics models. 
The next description, known as the energy–momentum tensor of a swarm of par-
ticles, is useful to determine the constant upper KK in Einstein’s ﬁeld equations 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R g Subscript i j Baseline equals upper K upper T Subscript i j Baseline periodRi j −1
2 Rgi j = K Ti j.
How can we describe a swarm of particles? 
They have to be identical, they have to be uniformly distributed in space, and they 
have to be non-interacting. Each particle has the rest mass m 0m0 and we suppose that, 
in an unit of volume of a given space-time, if the swarm is at rest, there are exactly 
n 0n0 particles (see [ 46]). 
The mass can be incorporated in a 44-momentum vector 
double struck upper P colon equals left parenthesis m comma m ModifyingAbove v With right arrow right parenthesis commaP := (m, m
→v ),
where mm is the mass of each non-interacting particle which moves at speed vv. If the  
swarm is at rest, 
double struck upper P 0 equals left parenthesis m 0 comma ModifyingAbove 0 With right arrow right parenthesis periodP0 = (m0,

that is, double struck upper P equals m 0 double struck upper V periodP = m0V.
Another 44-vector can be related to the number of particles, denoted by nn, in the  
unit of volume of the previous space-time which move at speed vv, 
double struck upper N colon equals left parenthesis n comma n ModifyingAbove v With right arrow right parenthesis periodN := (n, n

At rest, we choose 
double struck upper N 0 equals left parenthesis n 0 comma ModifyingAbove 0 With right arrow right parenthesis periodN0 = (n0,

It results in double struck upper N equals n 0 double struck upper V periodN = n0V.
If we deﬁne the density of mass for the swarm by the product between the mass 
of a particle and the number of particles in a unit volume of the space-time, we have

We have

therefore we can call upper T Superscript 00T 00 the density of the relativistic energy of the swarm. 
One may describe all the components of the energy–momentum tensor according to 
the physic units. However only upper T Superscript 00T 00 is used to determine upper KK. 
Suppose we are working in Fermi’s coordinates with a swarm of non-interacting 
particles which move together such that the world line of a particle is the x Superscript 0x0-axis.

We are interested in seeing under which conditions it is possible to recover the 
Classical Mechanics basic formulas involving gravity from the relativistic formulas 
seen in the present chapter. 
Let us discuss this point in a mathematical language: In this section we show 
that, in the case of a “week gravitational ﬁeld”, for “particles with slow motion”, the 
classical ﬁeld equations emerge from their relativistic counterparts, that is,

Adding small variations of orderStartFraction 1 Over c Superscript k Baseline EndFraction comma k greater than or equals 2 1

fore, the following deﬁnition is necessary to introduce our working frame: 
Deﬁnition 10.11.1 A weak gravitational ﬁeld is described by a metric 
g Subscript i j Baseline equals upper J Subscript i j Baseline plus StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction g Subscript i j Superscript left parenthesis 2 right parenthesis Baseline plus StartFraction 1 Over c cubed EndFraction g Subscript i j Superscript left parenthesis 3 right parenthesis Baseline plus upper O left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c Superscript 4 Baseline EndFraction right parenthesisgi j = Ji j + 1

i j

∂g(m)
i j
∂xα = O(1), m ∈{2, 3}, α ∈{1, 2, 3}.
Here, g Subscript i j Superscript left parenthesis 2 right parenthesisg(2)
i j are coefﬁcients of the metric g Subscript i jgi j related to the factor StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction 1
c2 , etc. In other 
words, StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction 1
c2 is our expansion parameter related to the strength of the ﬁeld. 
Let us ﬁrst observe that, for a weak gravitational ﬁeld, it is 
g Subscript i j Baseline equals upper J Subscript i j Baseline plus upper O left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction right parenthesisgi j = Ji j + O

and 
g Superscript i j Baseline equals upper J Superscript i j Baseline plus upper O left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction right parenthesis periodgi j = J i j + O
( 1
c2
)
.
Therefore, for a weak gravitational ﬁeld, we have the following consequences of the 
previous deﬁnition: 
g Subscript 0 j Baseline equals upper O left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction right parenthesis comma g Subscript alpha alpha Baseline equals upper O left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis comma StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript alpha Baseline EndFraction equals upper O left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c squared EndFraction right parenthesisg0 j = O

.
Then, it is easy to see that 
StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Superscript left parenthesis m right parenthesis Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript 0 Baseline EndFraction equals StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Superscript left parenthesis m right parenthesis Baseline Over partial differential t EndFraction StartFraction partial differential t Over partial differential x Superscript 0 Baseline EndFraction equals upper O left parenthesis 1 right parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c EndFraction equals upper O left parenthesis StartFraction 1 Over c EndFraction right parenthesis period

10.12 The Einstein Static Universe and the Cosmological 
Constant 
On 8 February 1917, the Prussian Academy of Science in Berlin published a paper by 
Albert Einstein where the ﬁrst application of his theory, published on 25 November 
1915, was presented [ 92]. The paper discussed a dynamical system describing a 
static space-time representing the Universe. It can be considered the birth of modern 
Cosmology. The model proved wrong after the discovery or recession of galaxies by 
Hubble, however it is important because several concepts presented in it were used 
in the further developments of this science. Let us give now a quick presentation 
of it. 
Consider

of cosmological expansion, however the concept of cosmological constant, used here, 
was considered later in view of the issues of cosmological inﬂation and dark energy 
discussed above. 
10.13 Cosmic Strings 
Cosmic strings are one-dimensional hypothetical structures emerged as topological 
defects of space-time in some phase transition after the Big Bang. They should 
have acted like seeds for cosmological large-scale structure formation [158]. A nice 
presentation of this topic is in [142]. Here, we adapted it for a metric with signature 
left parenthesis plus minus minus minus right parenthesis(+ −−−).

the equation

In order to avoid singularities, the metric has to reduce to the ﬂat Minkowski 
metric at the origin. This means that f left parenthesis r right parenthesis f (r) approaches rr for small rr. Therefore, two 
conditions for f f have to be given: f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0 f (0) = 0 and f prime left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 1 f '(0) = 1. 
Denote by r Subscript srs the value of rr such that sigma left parenthesis r right parenthesis equals 0σ(r) = 0 if r greater than or equals r Subscript sr ≥rs. The physical area of a

therefore, integrating the equation upper R 11 equals minus 8 pi upper G sigma left parenthesis r right parenthesisR11 = −8πGσ(r), we obtain

Integrating again, it results in 
f left parenthesis r right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 1 minus 4 upper G upper E right parenthesis r plus upper K comma f (r) = (1 −4GE)r + K,
where upper KK is a constant that should be 00 because f left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals 0 f (0) = 0.

which is a ﬂat metric. In this way, we have the simplest expression of a metric

of our chosen coordinate system. 
10.14 Planar Gravitational Waves 
Also the issue of gravitational waves can be dealt under the standard of our geometric 
approach. Here, we shall give just a short summary of this important topic. For a 
detailed discussion on the history, the theoretical foundation, and the discovery, we 
refer the reader to specialized texts and papers [ 1, 135, 178]. 
In order to deal with gravitational waves, we have to obtain metrics in a geometric 
coordinate system as 
d s squared equals left parenthesis alpha Subscript i j Baseline plus epsilon h Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline commads2 = (αi j + ehi j)dxidx j,
such that both Einstein’s ﬁeld equations and white medium square h Subscript i j Baseline equals 0[hi j = 0 are satisﬁed. 
Here, 
white medium square colon equals left parenthesis partial differential Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis partial differential Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis partial differential squared right parenthesis squared minus left parenthesis partial differential cubed right parenthesis squared comma[ := (∂0)2 −(∂1)2 −(∂2)2 −(∂3)2,
where 
left parenthesis partial differential Superscript k Baseline right parenthesis squared colon equals StartFraction partial differential squared Over left parenthesis partial differential x Superscript k Baseline right parenthesis squared EndFraction period(∂k)2 :=
∂2
(∂xk)2 .
Ifmu Subscript i jμi j are the coefﬁcients of the classical Minkowski metric, the previous d’Alembert 
operator deﬁnition can be written in a simpler form as 
white medium square colon equals mu Subscript i j Baseline partial differential Superscript i Baseline partial differential Superscript j Baseline period[ := μi j∂i∂j.
In any case it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd such kind of metrics because we have to develop the 
whole theory of tensor perturbations in General Relativity [135]. Instead of trying 
to ﬁnd out general gravitational wave solutions, let us focus on planar gravitational 
waves which are easier to obtain. See [171] for details. We follow this last reference 
to offer a ﬁrst glance on this subject. Consider the metric 
d s squared equals left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left bracket 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right bracket right parenthesis d t squared minus left parenthesis 1 minus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis d x squared minus d y squared minus d z squared minusds2 = (1 + cos(t −x)[2 + cos(t −x)])dt2 −(1 −cos2(t −x))dx2 −dy2 −dz2 −
minus 2 cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis d t d x period −2 cos(t −x)(1 + cos(t −x))dtdx.
10.14 Planar Gravitational Waves

The previous metric can be seen as a slightly perturbation of the Minkowski metric 
mu Subscript i jμi j because 
g Subscript i j Baseline equals mu Subscript i j Baseline plus h Subscript i j Baseline periodgi j = μi j + hi j.
A metric which such coefﬁcients is called a linearized metric. If it satisﬁes both 
Einstein’s vacuum ﬁeld equations and the conditions white medium square h Subscript i j Baseline equals 0[ hi j = 0, such a linearized 
metric describes gravitational planar waves. 
Theorem 10.14.1 The previous metric having the following non-zero coefﬁcients 
g 00 equals 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left parenthesis 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolon g 11 equals 1 minus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis semicolon g 22 equals g 33 equals negative 1 semicolong00 = 1 + cos(t −x)(2 + cos(t −x)); g11 = 1 −cos2(t −x); g22 = g33 = −1;
g 01 equals g 10 equals minus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolong01 = g10 = −cos(t −x)(1 + cos(t −x));
describes gravitational planar waves. 
Proof We have the non-zero perturbations 
h 00 equals cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left parenthesis 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolon h 11 equals minus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis semicolonh00 = cos(t −x) (2 + cos(t −x)); h11 = −cos2(t −x);
h 01 equals h 10 equals minus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis period h01 = h10 = −cos(t −x)(1 + cos(t −x)).
It is easy to see that 
white medium square cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis partial differential Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis squared cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis minus left parenthesis partial differential Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis equals 0[ cos(t −x) = (∂0)2 cos(t −x) −(∂1)2 cos(t −x) = 0
and 
white medium square cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis equals left parenthesis partial differential Superscript 0 Baseline right parenthesis squared cosine squared left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis minus left parenthesis partial differential Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis squared cosine squared left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis equals 0 comma[ cos(t −x) = (∂0)2 cos2(t −x) −(∂1)2 cos2(t −x) = 0,
therefore the conditions 
white medium square h Subscript i j Baseline equals 0[ hi j = 0
are fulﬁlled. 
Now it seems we have a lot of difﬁcult computations to do in order to prove 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ri j = 0. 
It is easy to provide a coordinate transformation for which the Ricci tensor can 
be computed. Let us consider the Minkowski metric 
d s squared equals d t overbar squared minus d x overbar squared minus d y overbar squared minus d z overbar squaredds2 = d ¯t2 −d ¯x2 −d ¯y2 −d¯z2
and the transformation

t overbar equals t plus sine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis comma x overbar equals x comma y overbar equals y comma z overbar equals z period¯t = t + sin(t −x), ¯x = x, ¯y = y, ¯z = z.
Since 
d t overbar equals left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis d t minus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis d x comma d x overbar equals d x comma d y overbar equals d y comma d z overbar equals d z commad ¯t = (1 + cos(t −x))dt −cos(t −x)dx, d ¯x = dx, d ¯y = dy, d¯z = dz,
the Minkowski metric turns into our metric 
d s squared equals left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left bracket 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right bracket right parenthesis d t squared minus left parenthesis 1 minus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis d x squared minus d y squared minus d z squared minusds2 = (1 + cos(t −x)[2 + cos(t −x)])dt2 −(1 −cos2(t −x))dx2 −dy2 −dz2 −
minus 2 cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus x right parenthesis right parenthesis d t d x period −2 cos(t −x)(1 + cos(t −x))dtdx.
Therefore upper R overbar Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 ¯Ri j = 0 transforms into the desired upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 periodRi j = 0.

ativity. Their discovery a century later can be considered one of the greatest achieve-
ments of modern Science. 
10.15 The Gödel Universe 
Another interesting metric is the one describing the so-called Gödel Universe [108] 
published 7 in 1949. 
First, let us show that the metric

Combining all four previous transformations, any point of upper MM can be mapped 
into any point ofupper MM without changing metric properties ofupper MM, i.e. any point can 
be seen as an origin. Therefore upper MM is homogeneous.

The point upper AA is a ﬁxed point of this group, and according to the previous obser-
vation, there exists a 2 pi2π periodicity experienced by any other point. Therefore 
upper MM allows rotations with respect any given point of it.
[
A space-time is time orientable, if the time-like and null vectors can be classiﬁed 
into two classes, the future-pointing and the past-pointing vectors as we did it in the 
case of the 22-Minkowski space (that is, with respect to a given vector). 
Let us remember: in the case of the Minkowski metricd s squared equals d t squared minus d x squaredds2 = dt2 −dx2, provided 
by the Minkowski productless than p comma q greater than Subscript upper M Baseline equals t Subscript p Baseline t Subscript q Baseline minus x Subscript p Baseline x Subscript q Baseline< p, q >M= tptq −x pxq, the vectore 1 equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 right parenthesise1 = (1, 0) is a time-
like vector because less than e 1 comma e 1 greater than Subscript upper M Baseline greater than 0< e1, e1 >M> 0 and the time-like vector v equals left parenthesis 3 comma 2 right parenthesisv = (3, 2) becomes a 
future-pointing time-like vector because less than v comma e 1 greater than Subscript upper M Baseline greater than 0< v, e1 >M> 0. The vector negative v−v becomes a 
past-pointing time-like vector. The vectorw equals left parenthesis 1 comma 1 right parenthesisw = (1, 1) is a null future-pointing vector, 
etc. 
A curvepsiψ is called time-like if the tangent vectorsModifyingAbove psi With dot ˙ψ are time-like future-pointing 
vectors. 
If we choose two events upper E 0 left parenthesis lamda 0 right parenthesisE0(λ0) and upper E 1 left parenthesis lamda 1 right parenthesisE1(λ1) connected by a time-like curve, we 
say thatupper E 0E0 is in the past ofupper E 1E1 (or, equivalently,upper E 1E1 is in the future ofupper E 0E0) iflamda 0 less than lamda 1λ0 < λ1. 
In the case of Gödel’s second metric, the vectoru Superscript i Baseline equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesisui = (1, 0, 0, 0) has the property 
g Subscript i j Baseline u Superscript i Baseline u Superscript j Baseline equals 4 greater than 0gi juiu j = 4 > 0, that is, u Superscript iui is a time-like vector. If v Superscript jv j is a time-like vector, that 
is, g Subscript i j Baseline v Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline greater than 0gi jviv j > 0, we say that v Superscript jv j is future pointing if g Subscript i j Baseline u Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline greater than 0gi juiv j > 0. If  g Subscript i j Baseline u Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline less than 0gi juiv j < 0 the 
vectorv Superscript jv j is called past pointing. The same, ifw Superscript kwk is a null vector, we can deﬁne past 
pointing and future-pointing null vectors according to the sign ofg Subscript i j Baseline u Superscript i Baseline w Superscript kgi juiwk. Therefore 
upper MM becomes time orientable. 
Theorem 10.15.2 The time orientable Gödel’s universe allows 
1. closed time-like curves; 
2. time-like loops, i.e. any two events connected by a time-like curve can be con-
nected by a closed time-like curve. 
Proof 
1. Consider the curve alpha left parenthesis s right parenthesis colon equals left parenthesis 0 comma upper R comma b s comma 0 right parenthesis comma b element of double struck upper Nα(s) := (0, R, bs, 0), b ∈N. 
Its velocity vector is ModifyingAbove alpha With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals v Superscript j Baseline equals left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma b comma 0 right parenthesis ˙α(s) = v j = (0, 0, b, 0). The norm of this vector depends 
on

If we choose, from the beginning upper R greater than ln left parenthesis 1 plus StartRoot 2 EndRoot right parenthesisR > ln(1 +
√
2), i.e. hyperbolic sine upper R greater than 1sinh R > 1, this vector 
is a time-like one. The chosen curve is a time-like curve according to the second 
statement of the previous theorem andalpha left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals alpha left parenthesis 2 pi right parenthesisα(0) = α(2π). We have obtained a closed 
time-like curve in upper MM. 
2. First, if we look only at the coordinates left parenthesis r comma phi comma t right parenthesis(r, φ, t), we observe that they deter-
mine completely the coordinatesleft parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x1, x2, x3). More precisely, for particular given 
left parenthesis r comma phi comma t right parenthesis(r, φ, t), we have particular correspondingleft parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x1, x2, x3). It remains the coordinate 
x Superscript 0x0 which depends ontt; therefore thet minust−lines of matter, in cylindrical coordinates, 
are x Superscript 0 minusx0−lines of matter.

We observe that gamma left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals upper B Subscript t 2γ(0) = Bt2 and gamma left parenthesis 2 n pi right parenthesis equals upper B Subscript t 1γ(2nπ) = Bt1. 
Using the same idea, we can derive time-like curves between upper B Subscript t 2Bt2 and upper B Subscript t 3Bt3 and 
between upper B Subscript t 3Bt3 and upper B Subscript t 1Bt1. The concatenation of the three time-like curves is a time-
like loop starting from upper B Subscript t 1Bt1, passing through upper B Subscript t 2Bt2, then toupper B Subscript t 3Bt3, to ﬁnally reach upper B Subscript t 1Bt1. 
We can conclude thattt is not a proper time coordinate, because if it is so, moving 
forward in time we return in our past. Therefore no global time coordinate exists 
in Gödel’s universe.

As we know, a space-time is time orientable if the time-like vectors can be clas-

e equals left parenthesis e Superscript 0 Baseline comma e Superscript 1 Baseline comma e squared comma e cubed right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 1 comma 0 comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesise = (e0, e1, e2, e3) = (1, 0, 1, 0) has the property ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis t comma r comma phi comma y right parenthesis e Superscript i Baseline e Superscript j Baseline equals 1 plus r squared greater than 0¯gi j(t,r, φ, y)eie j = 1 + r2 > 0, 
that is, ee is a time-like vector. If v equals left parenthesis v Superscript 0 Baseline comma v Superscript 1 Baseline comma v squared comma v cubed right parenthesisv = (v0, v1, v2, v3) is a time-like vector, i.e. 
ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis t comma r comma phi comma y right parenthesis v Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline greater than 0¯gi j(t,r, φ, y)viv j > 0 we say that vv is future pointing if ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis t comma r comma phi comma y right parenthesis e Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline greater than 0¯gi j(t,r, φ, y)eiv j > 0. If  
ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis t comma r comma phi comma y right parenthesis e Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline less than 0¯gi j(t,r, φ, y)eiv j < 0, the vector vv is called past pointing. Let us observe that if 
vv is time-like and future pointing then negative v−v is still time-like but past pointing. It is 
easy to see that negative e−e is past pointing because ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis t comma r comma phi comma y right parenthesis e Superscript i Baseline left parenthesis minus e Superscript j Baseline right parenthesis equals negative 1 minus r squared less than 0¯gi j(t,r, φ, y)ei(−e j) = −1 −r2 < 0. 
Therefore upper M overbar ¯M becomes time orientable. 
Theorem 10.16.2 The time orientable set upper M overbar ¯M allows time-like loops. 
Proof Consider the curve alpha left parenthesis s right parenthesis colon equals left parenthesis 0 comma upper R comma 2 n s comma 0 right parenthesisα(s) := (0, R, 2ns, 0). 
Its velocity vector is ModifyingAbove alpha With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals left parenthesis v Superscript 0 Baseline comma v Superscript 1 Baseline comma v squared comma v cubed right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 2 n comma 0 right parenthesis ˙α(s) = (v0, v1, v2, v3) = (0, 0, 2n, 0). We have at each point 
of this curve that 
d ModifyingAbove s With bar squared left parenthesis ModifyingAbove alpha With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove alpha With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis right parenthesis equals ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis 0 comma upper R comma 2 n s comma 0 right parenthesis v Superscript i Baseline v Superscript j Baseline equals 4 n squared upper R squared greater than 0 commad ¯s2( ˙α(s), ˙α(s)) = ¯gi j(0, R, 2ns, 0)viv j = 4n2R2 > 0,
i.e. this vector is a time-like one. More, 
d ModifyingAbove s With bar squared left parenthesis ModifyingAbove alpha With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis comma e right parenthesis equals ModifyingAbove g With bar Subscript i j Baseline left parenthesis 0 comma upper R comma 2 n s comma 0 right parenthesis v Superscript i Baseline e Superscript j Baseline equals 2 n upper R squared greater than 0 commad ¯s2( ˙α(s), e) = ¯gi j(0, R, 2ns, 0)vie j = 2nR2 > 0,
that is, the vectorModifyingAbove alpha With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis ˙α(s) is future pointing. At the same time,alpha left parenthesis 0 right parenthesisα(0) andalpha left parenthesis 2 pi right parenthesisα(2π) have the 
same image in upper MM, therefore the image of the curve alphaα in upper MM is starting from a point 
of upper MM to return at the same point. We have obtained a loop in upper MM. 
We have to observe that if we choose any point upper BB of this loop, the ﬁrst arch 
upper A upper B subset of upper MAB ⊂M is time oriented by the corresponding arch of alphaα in upper M overbar ¯M, therefore the event 
upper BB is in the future of the eventupper AA, while the archupper B upper A subset of upper MB A ⊂M, using the same reasoning, 
makes the event upper AA to be in the future of upper BB. We can say, in simple words, that going 
towards the future, we return to the past.

Theorem 10.16.3 (i) Any two points induced inupper MM by the coordinatesleft parenthesis t 1 comma upper R comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(t1, R, 0, 0)
andleft parenthesis t 2 comma upper R comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(t2, R, 0, 0) ofupper M overbar ¯M (such thatupper R squared greater than StartFraction 1 Over 2 pi EndFraction StartAbsoluteValue t 2 minus t 1 EndAbsoluteValueR2 > 1
2π |t2 −t1|) can be joined by a time-like 
curve such that the second point is in the future of the initial ﬁrst point. 
(ii) upper MM allows time-like closed curves. 
Proof (i) First, if we look only at the coordinates left parenthesis r comma phi comma y right parenthesis(r, φ, y), we observe that they 
determine completely the coordinates left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma x cubed right parenthesis(x1, x2, x3). It remains the coordinate x Superscript 0x0
which depends ontt, therefore thet minust−lines of matter in cylindrical coordinates are

in factx Superscript 0 minusx0−lines of matter. This observation allows to consider thex Superscript 0x0 coordinate 
as a time coordinate in the ﬁrst metric. Speciﬁcally, the initial metric has signature 
left parenthesis plus comma plus comma plus comma minus right parenthesis(+, +, +, −)with the time type coordinate followed byleft parenthesis plus comma plus comma minus right parenthesis(+, +, −). It is deﬁnitely 
different by the Lorentz-type metric having signatureleft parenthesis plus comma minus comma minus comma minus right parenthesis(+, −, −, −)whose spatial 
part has three components with the same sign minus. 
Therefore, let us consider the point upper B Subscript t 1 Baseline comma upper B Subscript t 2 Baseline element of upper M overbarBt1,
Bt2 ∈¯M with the coordinates 
left parenthesis t 1 comma upper R comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(t1, R, 0, 0), left parenthesis t 1 comma upper R comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis(t1, R, 0, 0), respectively. We proceed as we did it in the previous 
theorem. The curve 
gamma left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals left parenthesis t 1 plus StartFraction t 2 minus t 1 Over 2 pi EndFraction s comma upper R comma s comma 0 right parenthesis subset of upper M overbarγ(s) =
(
t1 + t2 −t1

is a time-like curve because the vector 
ModifyingAbove gamma With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis equals left parenthesis w Superscript 0 Baseline comma w Superscript 1 Baseline comma w squared comma w cubed right parenthesis equals left parenthesis StartFraction t 2 minus t 1 Over 2 pi EndFraction comma 0 comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesis˙γ(s) = (w0, w1, w2, w3) =
(t2 −t1

has the property 
d ModifyingAbove s With bar squared left parenthesis ModifyingAbove gamma With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis comma ModifyingAbove gamma With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis right parenthesis equals g overbar Subscript i j Baseline w Superscript i Baseline w Superscript j Baseline equals left parenthesis StartFraction t 2 minus t 1 Over 2 pi EndFraction right parenthesis squared plus upper R squared greater than 0 periodd ¯s2(˙γ(s), ˙γ(s)) = ¯gi jwiw j =
(t2 −t1

+ R2 > 0.
Furthermore, 
d ModifyingAbove s With bar squared left parenthesis ModifyingAbove gamma With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis comma e right parenthesis equals g overbar Subscript i j Baseline w Superscript i Baseline e Superscript j Baseline equals StartFraction t 2 minus t 1 Over 2 pi EndFraction plus upper R squared periodd ¯s2(˙γ(s), e) = ¯gi jwie j = t2 −t1
2π
+ R2.
The last expression is positive for the condition of theorem, that is, ModifyingAbove gamma With dot left parenthesis s right parenthesis˙γ(s) is 
pointing the future. We observe that gamma left parenthesis 0 right parenthesis equals upper B Subscript t 1γ(0) = Bt1 and gamma left parenthesis 2 pi right parenthesisγ(2π) and upper B Subscript t 2Bt2 have the 
same image in upper MM. Therefore, for the images in upper MM, i.e. upper E 1E1 and upper E 2E2, we can say 
that the event upper E 2E2 occurs after the event upper E 1E1. 
(ii) Using the previous idea we can generate the same time-like curves between upper B Subscript t 2Bt2
andupper B Subscript t 3Bt3 and betweenupper B Subscript t 3Bt3 andupper B Subscript t 1Bt1. The concatenation of the three time-like curves 
is the time-like “chain-curve” starting from upper B Subscript t 1Bt1, passing through upper B Subscript t 2Bt2, then to 
upper B Subscript t 3Bt3, to ﬁnally reach upper B Subscript t 1Bt1 again. Taking into consideration how events occur in 
relation to the future time-like tangent vectors of the curves, we can conclude 
that neither tt nor x Superscript 0x0 can be proper time coordinates, because if it is so, moving 
forward in time would mean to return in our past. Therefore no global time 
coordinate exists in this model. So we have derived a universe without both time 
and without matter.

The Case of Planar Gravitational Waves in this Space-time 
The issue of gravitational waves can be dealt in the context of the space-time without 
matter and time. Again, the power of coordinates change together with the convenient 
physical interpretation is the key for the desired result. Let us consider the initial

Since

the initial metric turns into the metric 
d s squared equals left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis left bracket 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis right bracket right parenthesis d t squared plus d x squared plus d y squared minus left parenthesis 1 minus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis right parenthesis d z squaredds2 = (1 + cos(t −z)[2 + cos(t −z)])dt2 + dx2 + dy2 −(1 −cos2(t −z))dz2

We observe that the metric can be arranged in the form 
d s squared equals g Subscript i j Baseline d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline equals left parenthesis alpha Subscript i j Baseline plus h Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline commads2 = gi jdxidx j = (αi j + hi j)dxidx j,
where the alpha 00 equals alpha 11 equals alpha 22 equals 1 comma alpha 33 equals negative 1 comma alpha Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 if i not equals j periodα00 = α11 = α22 = 1, α33 = −1, αi j = 0 if i /= j.
The non-zero coefﬁcients are 
g 00 equals 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis left parenthesis 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolon g 11 equals 1 semicolon g 22 equals 1 semicolon g 33 equals negative 1 plus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis semicolong00 = 1 + cos(t −z)(2 + cos(t −z)); g11 = 1; g22 = 1; g33 = −1 + cos2(t −z);
g 03 equals g 30 equals minus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolong03 = g30 = −cos(t −z)(1 + cos(t −z));
therefore the non-zero “perturbations” which appear are 
h 00 equals cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis left parenthesis 2 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis right parenthesis semicolon h 33 equals minus cosine squared left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis semicolonh00 = cos(t −z) (2 + cos(t −z)); h33 = −cos2(t −z);
h 03 equals h 30 equals minus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis left parenthesis 1 plus cosine left parenthesis t minus z right parenthesis right parenthesis period h03 = h30 = −cos(t −z)(1 + cos(t −z)).
According to the theory in [171], the metric 
d s squared equals g Subscript i j Baseline d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline equals left parenthesis alpha Subscript i j Baseline plus h Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis d x Superscript i Baseline d x Superscript jds2 = gi jdxidx j = (αi j + hi j)dxidx j

(in our case upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ri j = 0) and the wave equation, derived from them, 
white medium square h Subscript i j Baseline equals 0[ hi j = 0
for each perturbation involved in the metric coefﬁcients. We remember that the wave

on the set upper M overbar ¯M described by the new coordinates. 
In this case, it is important to split the time-like vectors in two classes. 
Denote the second metric coefﬁcients by g overbar Subscript i j¯gi j. The vector e equals left parenthesis e Superscript 0 Baseline comma e Superscript 1 Baseline comma e squared comma e cubed right parenthesis equals left parenthesis 1 comma 1 comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesise = (e0, e1, e2, e3) =

that if vv is time-like and future pointing, then negative v−v is still time-like but past pointing.

This way upper M overbar ¯M becomes time orientable.

Therefore we described a universe without a proper global time coordinate. If we 
look at the chain of curves, we understand that the “history” can change for someone 
who travels between two events in the way the observer decides. It is easy to see that 
chain curves do not satisfy the geodesic equations inupper MM. Therefore a chain curve, or 
only a part of it, is not an imposed geometric trajectory ofupper MM, it is completed by the 
“desire” of a moving point to follow the chosen trajectory. It remains only to think if 
it is acceptable to say that at each pointupper B Subscript tBt this universe splits in an inﬁnity of similar 
universes offering the superposition of all possible futures to a given inhabitant of it.

The issue is to ﬁnd some other coefﬁcients such that the Einstein ﬁeld equations 
are satisﬁed, in particular using polynomials instead of exponential functions. If we

10.19 The Wormhole Solutions 
In 1973, two interesting papers on traversable wormholes appeared. We are talking 
about results by Ellis [ 93] and Bronnikov [ 39], who independently studied possible 
wormhole solutions of the Einstein ﬁeld equations. We present here the conclusions 
of these papers to give an idea of wormhole solutions. 
Consider the metric

where aa is a real positive parameter. 
Denoting t colon equals x Superscript 0 Baseline comma r colon equals x Superscript 1 Baseline comma theta colon equals x squaredt := x0, r := x1, θ := x2 and phi colon equals x cubedφ := x3, the form of the metric is

There are two possible cases. 
In the ﬁrst case, the condition ModifyingAbove r With dot identical to 0˙r ≡0 leads to a constant kk,

Looking at the ﬁrst equation we see that only k equals lk = l can be considered in order to 
solve it. 
The second case is obtained if ModifyingAbove r With dot˙r is not identically null. We combine the two

If k squared greater than l squaredk2 > l2, the solution is related to the condition r squared greater than or equals k squared minus l squared greater than 0r2 ≥k2 −l2 > 0, therefore the 
geodesic is included in one of the two parts of the throat. 
Ifk squared equals l squaredk2 = l2, we have againr equals 0r = 0 separating the parts where a geodesic is included. 
If k squared less than l squaredk2 < l2, the geodesic can traverse the wormhole. 
It is easy to draw numerically the geodesics corresponding to the described situ-
ations. 
To conclude, we can say that this is just a simple prototype of wormhole solutions. 
Interested reader can consider the so-called Morris–Thorne wormhole [143] where 
traversability and stability conditions can be related to the energy conditions and the 
presence of exotic matter. A detailed discussion of the problem is reported in the book
10.19 The Wormhole Solutions

by Frolov and Novikov [103]. It is also possible to derive wormhole solutions where 
geometric contributions stabilize and make the structures traversable [ 59]. Also if 
wormholes have not been observed yet, this is a very important research area. See, 
for example [ 84], for a general discussion on the topic in Metric-Afﬁne Theories of 
Gravity.

Rem tene, verba sequentur. 
Cato 
We want to conclude this book considering a gravity theory without masses which can 
be constructed in Minkowski spaces using a geometric Minkowski potential. From 
the point of view of this book, this can be considered a full geometric realization of the 
relativistic approach. The afﬁne space-like spheres can be seen as the regions of the 
Minkowski space-like vectors characterized by a constant Minkowski gravitational 
potential. They highlight, for each dimension n greater than or equals 3n ≥3, a model of space-time, the de 
Sitter one, which satisﬁes Einstein’s ﬁeld equations in the absence of matter, and it 
is now intuitive why. This chapter is based on results that can be found in [ 28, 31, 
82, 112, 173].

11.2 De Sitter Spacetime and Its Cosmological Constant

Theorem 11.1.1 The Minkowski gradient of the Minkowski gravitational potential 
is the opposite of the Minkowski gravitational ﬁeld. 
Proof It is easy to check the equality nabla Subscript upper M Baseline upper Phi Subscript upper M Superscript n Baseline equals minus upper A Subscript upper M Superscript n Baseline period∇MΦn

Theorem 11.1.2 The Minkowski Laplacian of the Minkowski gravitational potential 
is null. 
Proof The same, it is easy to check nabla Subscript upper M Superscript 2 Baseline upper Phi Subscript upper M Superscript n Baseline equals 0 period∇2

The last relation is the equation of the Minkowski geometric gravitational ﬁeld. 
In the case when bb is the origin of the Minkowski space, the Minkowski uni-
tary space-like sphere can be thought as the set of points of double struck upper M Superscript nMn described by the 
constant gravitational Minkowski potentialupper Phi Subscript upper M Superscript n Baseline equals negative 1Φn
M = −1. In this theory, at each dimen-
sionnn, the Minkowski geometrical gravitational force and the Minkowski geometric 
gravitational ﬁeld have the physical dimensionStartFraction 1 Over left parenthesis l right parenthesis Superscript n minus 1 Baseline EndFraction

potential has the physical dimension StartFraction 1 Over left parenthesis l right parenthesis Superscript n minus 2 Baseline EndFraction

(l)n−2 where left parenthesis l right parenthesis(l) is a length. 
We may conclude: for each dimension, in the Minkowski space-like vectors 
region, a natural geometric Minkowski gravity appears in the absence of matter. 
An equivalent of the Newton gravity theory can be constructed starting from the 
Minkowski geometric gravitational potential. The afﬁne space-like spheres can be 
seen as the regions of the Minkowski space-like vectors characterized by a con-
stant Minkowski gravitational potential. They highlight, at each dimension n greater than or equals 3n ≥3, a  
model of space-time, the de Sitter one, which satisﬁes Einstein’s ﬁeld equations in 
the absence of matter, and it is now intuitive why.

Let us look again at thet x 1tx1 plane and suppose we have the trajectory of a photon

have

where upper C 1C1 is a constant. This function is increasing. The limit as qq approaches negative normal infinity−∞
is upper C 1C1 and the limit as qq approaches plus normal infinity+∞is pi plus upper C 1π + C1, therefore a photon image curve 
in t x 1tx1 plane is completely included in a strip with width piπ. The same happens for 
the photon described by

to imagine that, at each point of the de Sitter space-time, the situation is the same: 
the Euclidean hyperboloid have, at each point, a pair of straight lines embedded into

For this metric, we have

We can conceive this curve as at the initial singularity at the origin of the de Sit-

Therefore, the line is the evolution in time of the point and it is the ﬁrst line we 
considered in the part of de Sitter space-time out of the singularity curve.

All these time-like geodesics for t equals tau greater than 0t = τ > 0 starting from the initial singularity are 
part of the texture of the de Sitter space-time. Observe that not all of the Minkowski

A Geometric Realization of Relativity: The de Sitter Space-time

parameterization makes sense also fort equals tau less than 0t = τ < 0. We have the image of an evolution 
of a singularity corresponding to the de Sitter space-time in a chosen time direction. 
De Sitter space-time is only a possible geometric realization of Relativity. Another 
possible realization is analysed in the next chapter. We are talking about the Anti-de 
Sitter space-time. We prefer to warn the reader about the fact that some geometric 
properties of de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter spaces-times are different if we prefer 
different metric signatures and other types of Minkowski spheres chosen in the basic 
deﬁnitions. Other interesting geometric realizations of space-times can be found in 
[167].
Chapter 12 
Another Geometric Realization 
of Relativity: The Anti-de Sitter 
Space–Time 
It is wrong to think that the task of Physics is to ﬁnd out how 
Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature. 
Niels Bohr 
There are a lot of similarities between de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space–times; 
therefore, we want to present here some geometric aspects which are not highlighted 
in the previous chapter. Before developing a geometric theory of gravity which can 
be extended in Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis p comma q right parenthesisM(p,q) spaces and before reaching the subject of Anti-de 
Sitter space–times as examples of universes without matter, we want to introduce 
some facts related to the centro-afﬁne geometry, a branch of geometry developed by 
Gheorghe Tzitzeica. These facts are essential for the development of the chapter (see 
[ 30]). 
The theory of Tzitzeica surfaces in Euclidean spaces was the starting point of 
the afﬁne differential geometry in which the differential invariants depend on the 
metric, but they are also preserved by afﬁne transformations (see [151, 186, 187]). 
The geometric nature of de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space–times is related to the 
Minkowski afﬁne differential geometry and this is the main aspect we are going to 
present here. 
Shortly, in the case of Euclidean33-dimensional space, the deﬁnition of a Tzitzeica 
surface is this: we choose a point f left parenthesis p right parenthesis f (p) of the surface locally written in the form 
f left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis equals left parenthesis x comma y comma u left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis right parenthesis f (x, y) = (x, y, u(x, y)) and we compute the Gaussian curvature upper K Subscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisK f (p) at that 
point. Then, we compute the distance, denoted by d Subscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesisd f (p), from the origin upper O left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesisO(0, 0, 0)
to the tangent plane of the surface at the pointf left parenthesis p right parenthesis f (p). The surface is called a Tzitzeica 
surface, if the ratio upper R Superscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis colon equals StartFraction upper K Subscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis Over d Subscript f Superscript 4 Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis EndFractionR f (p) := K f (p)
d4
f (p) is a constant at each pp, that is upper R Superscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals upper R Superscript fR f (p) = R f . 
The constant upper R Superscript fR f is called “afﬁne radius” and becomes an intrinsic number attached 
to the surface.

Another Geometric Realization of Relativity …
Both de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space–times are Minkowski-afﬁne Tzitzeica 
hypersurfaces and they have the afﬁne radius related to their Ricci curvature scalar 
upper RR. We have to point out that only the Gauss constant geometric curvature is not essen-
tial for a surface to be an afﬁne sphere. The pseudosphere has constant Gaussian 
curvature but it is not a Tzitzeica surface; de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter space–times 
have constant Ricci curvature and both fulﬁl the Tzitzeica property, which in fact 
makes them remarkable. 
Let us explain how it works in the case of surfaces. Suppose we have computed 
the afﬁne radius

f (p) .
By deﬁnition, a centro-afﬁne transformation of the surfacef f consists in the product 
between the surface f f and 3 times 33 × 3 matrix double struck upper AA, with det double struck upper A not equals 0det A /= 0. Therefore the surface 
obtained is now 
ModifyingAbove f With bar left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis equals left parenthesis a 11 x plus a 21 y plus a 31 u left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis comma a 12 x plus a 22 y plus a 32 u left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis comma a 13 x plus a 23 y plus a 33 u left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis right parenthesis comma ¯f (x, y) = (a11x + a21y + a31u(x, y), a12x + a22y + a32u(x, y), a13x + a23y + a33u(x, y)),
where the coefﬁcients a Subscript i jai j are the components of the matrix double struck upper A periodA.
For this surface f overbar ¯f , when we compute upper R Superscript f overbar Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesis equals StartFraction upper K Subscript f overbar Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesis Over d Subscript f overbar Superscript 4 Baseline left parenthesis q right parenthesis EndFractionR ¯f (q) = K ¯f (q)

¯f (q) , we obtain a constant if and 
only if the initialupper R Superscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis equals StartFraction upper K Subscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis Over d Subscript f Superscript 4 Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis EndFractionR f (p) = K f (p)
d4
f (p) is a constant. The constant is the same if and only 
if det double struck upper A equals 1det A = 1 and this can be called the total afﬁne invariance condition. 
The previous observation allows to extend the deﬁnition of Tzitzeica surfaces to 
hypersurfaces in Euclidean and Minkowski nn-dimensional spaces, the afﬁne radius 
being there the ratio StartFraction upper K Subscript f Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis Over d Subscript f Superscript left parenthesis n plus 1 right parenthesis Baseline left parenthesis p right parenthesis EndFraction K f (p)

A general theory about curves and surfaces in Minkowski spacesupper M Superscript left parenthesis 1 comma n right parenthesisM(1,n) is reported 
in [132], while the extension of the concept of Tzitzeica surfaces to Minkowski three-
dimensional spaces is presented in [ 28]. Other basic results in Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 1 comma n right parenthesisM(1,n)
spaces are reported in [ 31]. In the following, we present a generalization for hyper-
surfaces in Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma n right parenthesisM(2,n) spaces in a way that can be immediately extended to 
Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis p comma q right parenthesisM(p,q) spaces. All these results will be related to the Physics of Anti-de 
Sitter space–times (see [ 30]). 
12.1 The Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) Geometric Gravitational Force 
The theory we present below is reported in details in [ 30] and can be formulated 
in any Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis p comma q right parenthesisM(p,q) space. In the case of upper M Superscript left parenthesis 1 comma n right parenthesisM(1,n) Minkowski spaces, it was 
ﬁrst presented in [ 31]. Let us say that upper M Superscript left parenthesis 1 comma n right parenthesisM(1,n) is the Minkowski nn-dimensional space 
endowed with the Minkowski product

respect to a given b equals left parenthesis b 0 comma b 1 comma b 2 comma b 3 right parenthesisb = (b0, b1, b2, b3), we consider all vectors x equals left parenthesis x 0 comma x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 right parenthesisx = (x0, x1, x2, x3)

lead us to the following two theorems. 
Theorem 12.1.1 The Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) gradient of the Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) gravita-
tional potential is the opposite of the Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) gravitational ﬁeld. 
Proof It is easy to check the equality nabla upper Phi equals negative upper A period∇Φ = −A.
[
Theorem 12.1.2 The Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) Laplacian of the Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) gravi-
tational potential is null. 
Proof The same, it is easy to check nabla squared upper Phi equals 0 period∇2Φ = 0.
[
The last relation is here the equation of the Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) geometric gravita-
tional ﬁeld. 
In the case whenbb is the origin of the Minkowskiupper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) space, the unitary space-
like sphere can be thought as the set of points of upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) described by the constant 
gravitational Minkowski potential upper Phi Subscript upper M Superscript 4 Baseline equals negative 1Φ4
M = −1. 
The Minkowskiupper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) geometrical gravitational force and the Minkowskiupper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4)
geometrical gravitational ﬁeld have dimensionStartFraction 1 Over left parenthesis l right parenthesis cubed EndFraction 1
(l)3 whereleft parenthesis l right parenthesis(l) is a length. Therefore, 
we can replace byStartFraction 1 Over left parenthesis m right parenthesis cubed EndFraction
1
(m)3 . In the  same  way,  the Minkowskiupper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 4 right parenthesisM(2,4) gravitational poten-
tial has as dimension StartFraction 1 Over left parenthesis m right parenthesis squared EndFraction
1
(m)2 . 
We may conclude: For each dimension, generalizing the previous theory, in the 
Minkowskiupper M Superscript left parenthesis p comma q right parenthesisM(p,q) space-like vectors region, a natural geometric Minkowski gravity 
appears in the absence of matter. Adapting the number of positive and negative signs, 
we can construct adapted Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis p comma q right parenthesisM(p,q) gradients and Laplacians. An equiva-
lent of the Newton gravity theory can be constructed this way. The afﬁne space-like
12.2 The Minkowski–Tzitzeica Surfaces

spheres can be seen as the regions of the Minkowskiupper M Superscript left parenthesis p comma q right parenthesisM(p,q) space-like vectors char-
acterized by a constant Minkowski gravitational potential. They highlight a model 
of space–time, the Anti-de Sitter one, which satisﬁes Einstein’s ﬁeld equations in 
the absence of matter and this happens because they are surfaces generated by a 
Minkowski gravitational force described without mass distributions. 
12.2 The Minkowski–Tzitzeica Surfaces 
The theory we present here is developed in [ 31]. However, according to the geometric 
structure of Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma q right parenthesisM(2,q) some formulas are changed with respect to the cited 
reference. See also [ 30]. 
In a Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 3 right parenthesisM(2,3) space, we have: 
• the Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 3 right parenthesisM(2,3) product of vectors 
left angle bracket a comma b right angle bracket Subscript upper M Baseline colon equals a 0 b 0 plus a 1 b 1 minus a 2 b 2 comma <a, b>M := a0b0 + a1b1 −a2b2 ,
• the Minkowski upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 3 right parenthesisM(2,3) crossproduct of vectors 
a times Subscript upper M Baseline b colon equals left parenthesis a 1 b 2 minus a 2 b 1 comma minus a 0 b 2 plus a 2 b 0 comma a 1 b 0 minus a 0 b 1 right parenthesis commaa ×M b := (a1b2 −a2b1, −a0b2 + a2b0, a1b0 −a0b1) ,
which can be understood from the formal determinant components,

Consider a matrix double struck upper A element of script upper M 3 left parenthesis double struck upper R right parenthesis commaA ∈M3(R), such that det double struck upper A not equals 0det A /= 0.

described by the rows of the matrix double struck upper AA. Therefore, the initial volume determined by 
the vectors left parenthesis 1 comma 0 comma 0 right parenthesis semicolon left parenthesis 0 comma 1 comma 0 right parenthesis comma left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 1 right parenthesis(1, 0, 0); (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), that is 11, is transformed into the volume 
det double struck upper Adet A.

12.5 Anti-de Sitter Space–Times as Afﬁne Hypersurfaces. 
Their Cosmological Constant and Its Connection 
with the Afﬁne Radius 
All de Sitter space–times are afﬁne hypersurfaces whose cosmological constants are 
connected to their afﬁne radii (see [ 31]). A similar conclusion can be seen in the case 
of Anti-de Sitter space–times. Let’s see why. 
In the case n equals 3n = 3, the Anti-de Sitter space–time here denoted upper A d upper S left parenthesis 2 comma 3 right parenthesisAdS(2, 3), is the  
Minkowski time-like sphere of upper M Superscript left parenthesis 2 comma 3 right parenthesisM(2,3) having the equation 
upper X 0 squared plus upper X 1 squared minus upper X 2 squared equals minus a squared periodX2

The two numbers involved in the above notationupper A d upper S left parenthesis 2 comma 3 right parenthesisAdS(2, 3) are22, from the dimension 
of the space-like sphere and 33 from the total dimension of the ambient Minkowski 
space. 
We met it when we studied non-Euclidean geometries, more precisely, the hyper-
boloid model. 
For this Anti-de Sitter space–time, we have, according to the Einstein theorem 
for surfaces 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline equals upper K Subscript f Superscript upper M Baseline g Subscript i j BaselineRi j = K M
f gi j
therefore 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline plus StartFraction 1 Over a squared EndFraction g Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 periodRi j + 1
a2 gi j = 0.
This last equation can be written as 
upper R Subscript i j Baseline minus one half upper R g Subscript i j Baseline equals 0 commaRi j −1
2 R gi j = 0,
that is normal upper Lamda equals 0/ = 0 and upper T Subscript i j Baseline equals 0Ti j = 0. upper RR is still depending on the centro-afﬁne invariant

More Than Metric: Geometric Objects 
for Alternative Pictures of Gravity 
Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be 
regarded as real. 
Niels Bohr 
In the previous discussions, we presented General Relativity as a theory essentially 
based on metric as the main object capable of being related to physical observables. 
Thanks to the Equivalence Principle, the Einstein formulation is a “metric theory 
of gravity” where causal structure (related to metric and light cones) and geodesic 
structure (related to geodesics and motions along them) coincide. This is not the only 
possibility and more general formulations of gravitational interaction can require 
other mathematical tools besides the metric [ 49, 55]. In other words, metric may 
have an “ancillary role” instead of being the main object of investigation as shortly 
discussed in Chap. 10. The need to extend or modify the Einstein theory comes mainly 
from several issues related to Physics (see, for example, [ 45, 61] for a discussion). 
We intend to present here, in a more abstract way, the geometric objects considered 
in the chapters devoted to Differential Geometry. We will see that the metric may 
not even be involved in the description of gravity. After presenting basic results 
about differentiable manifolds, tensors, exterior forms, differential forms, vector 
ﬁelds, and general afﬁne connections, we will take into account a special afﬁne 
connection, the Levi-Civita one. This connection is related to metric and then involves 
the Equivalence Principle. Then General Relativity is only a particular theory in 
the wide world of theories of gravity. Concepts as tetrad ﬁelds, the commutator 
of covariant derivatives, and the spin connection will give us the tools to develop 
metric-afﬁne theories and then alternative pictures as Teleparallel Gravity.

More Than Metric: Geometric Objects for Alternative Pictures of Gravity
13.1 
Differentiable Manifolds 
Let us remember the way we studied the unit sphere in the chapter devoted to surfaces. 
“The algebraic point of view is related to equations deﬁning manifolds. upper X squared plus upper Y squared plus upper Z squared equals 1X2 + Y 2 +
Z2 = 1 is the algebraic deﬁnition of a sphere centred at the origin with radius 11. In  
Differential Geometry, we deal with smooth functions describing a surface. 
The previous sphere can be seen as the smooth function f colon left parenthesis 0 comma pi right parenthesis times left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesis right arrow double struck upper E cubed f : (0, π) × (0, 2π) →
E3, 
f left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesis equals left parenthesis sine x Superscript 1 Baseline cosine x squared comma sine x Superscript 1 Baseline sine x squared comma cosine x Superscript 1 Baseline right parenthesis comma x Superscript 1 Baseline element of left parenthesis 0 comma pi right parenthesis comma x squared element of left parenthesis 0 comma 2 pi right parenthesis Superscript double prime Baseline period f (x1, x2) = (sin x1 cos x2, sin x1 sin x2, cos x1), x1 ∈(0, π), x2 ∈(0, 2π)''.
Now, let us observe that the entire sphere is not the image of the previous function. 
The meridian arc between the North Poleupper N left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma 1 right parenthesisN(0, 0, 1) and the South Poleupper S left parenthesis 0 comma 0 comma negative 1 right parenthesisS(0, 0, −1)
corresponding to x squared equals 0x2 = 0 is missing. We have obtained important results about the 
Differential Geometry of the unit sphere, but all results were obtained for the unit 
sphere minus the NS meridian arc. Therefore all geodesics of the unit sphere have a 
point which is missing, at least one. Of course, we understood the power of changing 
coordinates. Rotations can be used to give information about another image of the 
sphere, therefore the missing points can be included in the image of geodesics. The 
same rotations can be used to obtain information about Gaussian curvature of a 
missing point. Somehow, in our mind, it is clear that we can obtain the missing point 
information using a suitable coordinate transformation. Can we write all these in 
a formal mathematical language? The answer is yes and it is related to the notion 
of differentiable manifold. In simple words, a differentiable manifold is something 
which is locally similar to a system of coordinates to allow us to apply the calculus 
and the formulas seen in the chapter on Differential Geometry. This can be obtained 
using a collection of charts called atlas. 
In order to start in formalizing the problem, let us consider the Euclidean nn-
dimensional space upper E Superscript nEn. As we know, there is the Euclidean inner product which 
generates the Euclidean normStartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue dot StartAbsoluteValue EndAbsoluteValue|| · || of vectors and the Euclidean distancedd between 
two points. An open ball upper B Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesisBr(x) with xx as centre and rr as radius is the set 
upper B Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis colon equals StartSet y element of upper E Superscript n Baseline vertical bar d left parenthesis x comma y right parenthesis less than r EndSet periodBr(x) := {y ∈En| d(x, y) < r}.
Taking into account the Euclidean nn-dimensional space upper E Superscript nEn, we can say that the 
Euclidean topology on double struck upper R Superscript nRn is the topology generated by these balls. Therefore the 
open sets of the Euclidean topology on double struck upper R Superscript nRn consist of arbitrary unions of open balls 
upper B Subscript r Baseline left parenthesis x right parenthesis comma r greater than 0 comma x element of double struck upper R Superscript nBr(x), r > 0, x ∈Rn. 
We denote by script upper TT the topology on double struck upper R Superscript nRn described above. It will be used to deﬁne an 
atlas double struck upper R Superscript nRn-type as we will understand from the following deﬁnition. 
Deﬁnition 13.1.1 Let upper MM be an arbitrary non-empty set. Consider a set of indexes 
denoted byupper AA. A smooth atlas onupper MM is a collection of charts script upper A equals StartSet left parenthesis upper U Subscript a Baseline comma h Subscript a Baseline right parenthesis vertical bar a element of upper A EndSetA = {(Ua, ha) | a ∈A}
such that:

Deﬁnition 13.1.2 The set upper MM together with the smooth atlas script upper AA is called a differen-
tiable manifold. 
Let us understand the previous deﬁnitions looking at an example. Of course, we 
can choose the previous sphere considering a differentiable manifold structure. In 
this way, we understand the preliminaries made before the deﬁnitions. 
Example 13.1.3 Consider upper S squared equals StartSet left parenthesis x comma y comma z right parenthesis element of double struck upper R cubed vertical bar x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals 1 EndSetS2 =

which obviously is a smooth 
map. In other words, it is a differentiable manifold structure to the unit sphere with 
all described implications. 
Starting from this point all results can be done in the context of differentiable 
manifolds. To preserve our style, we continue to work with one chart of the atlas only. 
We preserve the name of this chart, i.e. system of coordinates, and the chart changes 
restricted only to our chart will be called as before, i.e. changes of coordinates.

To succeed in giving an intuitive description, we start remembering some deﬁnitions 
used in the chapter devoted to surfaces. 
In the3 upper D3D Euclidean spaceupper E cubedE3, each surface is an image of a functionf colon upper U right arrow upper E cubed f : U →E3, 
where upper UU is an open set of double struck upper R squaredR2. 
bullet• Denote by pp a point of upper UU. 
bullet• Therefore p colon equals left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared right parenthesisp := (x1, x2). 
bullet• The vector tangents to the surface at the point f left parenthesis p right parenthesis f (p) are StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction ∂f
∂x1 and StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction ∂f
∂x1 computed 
at pp. 
bullet• The vector space generated by these vectors is called a tangent space at f left parenthesis p right parenthesis f (p) to 
the surface f f and it is denoted by upper T Subscript p Baseline fTp f . 
bullet• upper T Subscript p Baseline fTp f contains all vectors v Subscript pvp written in the form v Subscript p Baseline equals v Superscript 1 Baseline StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis p right parenthesis plus v squared StartFraction partial differential f Over partial differential x Superscript 1 Baseline EndFraction left parenthesis p right parenthesis periodvp = v1 ∂f
∂x1 (p) + v2 ∂f
∂x1 (p).
bullet• According to the Theorema Egregium by Gauss, the extra dimension necessary to 
obtain geometric information on the surface can be cancelled. 
Following these considerations, let us see the above picture in a more abstract 
way, i.e. in the absence of the surface and increasing the number of dimensions. 
bullet• Let upper MM be a set of real coordinates left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma period period period comma x Superscript n Baseline right parenthesis(x1, x2, ..., xn) in which we wish to develop 
geometric concepts. 
bullet• p colon equals left parenthesis x Superscript 1 Baseline comma x squared comma period period period comma x Superscript n Baseline right parenthesisp := (x1, x2, ..., xn) is a given point of upper MM. 
bullet• The tangent space atpp will be denoted byupper T Subscript p Baseline upper MTpM and consists in all vectorsv Subscript pvp such 
that they are described by

Of course, we can write a vector v Subscript pvp using the Einstein summation rule,

bullet• At any pp, the above vector can be identiﬁed by its components, i.e. v Subscript p Baseline equals left parenthesis v Superscript 1 Baseline comma v squared comma period period period comma v Superscript n Baseline right parenthesisvp =
(v1, v2, ..., vn). 
bullet• The tangent space upper T Subscript p Baseline upper MTpM is a nn-dimensional vector space. 
bullet• Denote by upper T upper M colon equals square union Underscript p element of upper M Endscripts upper T Subscript p Baseline upper M equals union Underscript p element of upper M Endscripts StartSet p EndSet times upper T Subscript p Baseline upper MT M :=

{p} × TpM the tangent bundle of upper MM. 
bullet• Denote by script upper F script left parenthesis script upper M script right parenthesisF(M) the set of all smooth functions on upper MM to double struck upper RR. Remember that these 
functions are smooth at each p element of upper Mp ∈M. 
bullet• For such a functionh colon upper M right arrow double struck upper Rh : M →R at eachp element of upper Np ∈N, it makes sense the operationv Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis h right parenthesisvp(h)

bullet• Denote by upper T Subscript p Superscript asterisk Baseline upper MT ∗
p M the dual of upper T Subscript p Baseline upper MTpM. It is called a cotangent space at pp and contains 
all linear functions deﬁned on upper T Subscript p Baseline upper MTpM to double struck upper RR. Obviously, left parenthesis d h right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline element of upper T Subscript p Superscript asterisk Baseline upper M(dh)p ∈T ∗

is the basis of the vector space upper T Subscript p Baseline upper MTpM, while the set

is the basis of the vector space upper T Subscript p Superscript asterisk Baseline upper MT ∗

bullet• It is obvious that the differential of hh at pp is a linear function and it can be written 
in the form 
left parenthesis d h right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript k equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts left parenthesis StartFraction partial differential h Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis d x Superscript k Baseline right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline period(dh)p =

Starting from this point, we can work with general nn-dimensional real vector 
spaces upper VV and upper V Superscript asteriskV ∗instead upper T Subscript p Baseline upper MTpM and upper T Subscript p Superscript asterisk Baseline upper MT ∗

In fact, all these ﬁnite dimensional real vector spaces are isomorphic. 
If StartSet e 1 comma e 2 comma period period period comma e Subscript n Baseline EndSet{e1, e2, ..., en} is the canonical basis of upper VV and StartSet p 1 comma p 2 comma period period period comma p Subscript n Baseline EndSet{p1, p2, ..., pn} is the canonical

it results in omega 1 and omega 2 element of normal upper Lamda Superscript m plus r Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline comma double struck upper R right parenthesis periodω1 ∧ω2 ∈/m+r (Rn, R) .
Therefore the exterior product is obtained by the alternatization (we may say also 
alternatization) of the tensor product. 
Some textbooks deﬁne the wedge product in the form 
omega 1 and omega 2 colon equals StartFraction left parenthesis m plus r right parenthesis factorial Over m factorial r factorial EndFraction script upper A left parenthesis omega 1 circled times omega 2 right parenthesis commaω1 ∧ω2 := (m + r)!

This wedge product is often called “exterior product”. If one compares to our 
deﬁnition, it is only a constant which makes the difference. We continue to use our 
deﬁnition. 
Let us observe that upper V Superscript asteriskV ∗is in fact upper V Superscript 0 comma 1V 0,1. 
The same, we can observe that if alpha element of upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline comma beta element of upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline commaα ∈V ∗, β ∈V ∗, then alpha circled times beta element of upper V Superscript 0 comma 2 Baseline periodα ⊗β ∈V 0,2.
There is an immediate generalization: if alpha 1 element of upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline comma period period period comma alpha Subscript m Baseline element of upper V Superscript asterisk Baseline commaα1 ∈V ∗, ..., αm ∈V ∗, then alpha 1 circled times period period period circled times alpha Subscript m Baseline element of upper V Superscript 0 comma mα1 ⊗... ⊗
αm ∈V 0,m. 
This way the set left brace p Subscript i 1 Baseline circled times p Subscript i 2 Baseline circled times period period period circled times p Subscript i Sub Subscript m Subscript Baseline right brace Subscript 1 less than or slanted equals i 1 comma i 2 comma period period period comma i Sub Subscript m Subscript less than or slanted equals n

The following natural question occurs: which is the vector basis of normal upper Lamda Superscript m Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline comma double struck upper R right parenthesis/m (Rn, R)? 
To answer, it is necessary to better understand the properties of the exterior prod-
uct. Using the deﬁnition, we observe that 
left parenthesis omega 1 and omega 2 right parenthesis left parenthesis v 1 comma v 2 right parenthesis equals omega 1 left parenthesis v 1 right parenthesis dot omega 2 left parenthesis v 2 right parenthesis minus omega 1 left parenthesis v 2 right parenthesis dot omega 2 left parenthesis v 1 right parenthesis (ω1 ∧ω2) (v1, v2) = ω1 (v1) · ω2 (v2) −ω1 (v2) · ω2 (v1)
for omega 1 comma omega 2 element of normal upper Lamda Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline comma double struck upper R right parenthesisω1, ω2 ∈/1 (Rn, R). 
It results in 
omega and omega equals 0ω ∧ω = 0
for all omega element of normal upper Lamda Superscript 1 Baseline left parenthesis double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline comma double struck upper R right parenthesis periodω ∈/1 (Rn, R) .
Proposition 13.2.3 The following equalities hold:

We are ready to present the structure equations of double struck upper R Superscript nRn.. 
For x equals left parenthesis x 1 comma x 2 comma period period period comma x Subscript n Baseline right parenthesisx = (x1, x2, ..., xn) and y equals left parenthesis y 1 comma y 2 comma period period period comma y Subscript n Baseline right parenthesisy = (y1, y2, ..., yn) in double struck upper R Superscript nRn, the usual inner product is 
left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket equals x 1 y 1 plus x 2 y 2 plus period period period plus x Subscript n Baseline y Subscript n Baseline period<x, y> = x1y1 + x2y2 + ... + xnyn.
In fact we can consider at each point p element of double struck upper R Superscript np ∈Rn the above vectors and we can write 
left angle bracket x comma y right angle bracket Subscript p Baseline equals x 1 y 1 plus x 2 y 2 plus period period period plus x Subscript n Baseline y Subscript n Baseline period<x, y>p = x1y1 + x2y2 + ... + xnyn.
This way we considered at each pointp element of double struck upper R Superscript np ∈Rn the tangent spaceupper T Subscript p Baseline double struck upper R Superscript nTpRn and the vectors 
xx andyy asx Subscript p Baseline comma y Subscript p Baseline element of upper T Subscript p Baseline double struck upper R Superscript nx p, yp ∈TpRn. So, the inner product was added to the vector space struc-
ture of upper T Subscript p Baseline double struck upper R Superscript nTpRn. Having all these in mind at each p element of double struck upper R Superscript np ∈Rn we consider nn differentiable 
vector ﬁelds StartSet e 1 comma e 2 comma period period period comma e Subscript n Baseline EndSet{e1, e2, ..., en} such that 
left angle bracket e Subscript i Baseline comma e Subscript j Baseline right angle bracket Subscript p Baseline equals delta Subscript i j Baseline period<ei, e j>p = δi j.
This is an orthonormal moving frame of upper T double struck upper R Superscript nT Rn such that each e Subscript iei is a smooth map on 
double struck upper R Superscript nRn to double struck upper RR. 
Since left parenthesis d e Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis Subscript p(dei)p is also a linear map on double struck upper R Superscript nRn to double struck upper RR, at each pp and v element of double struck upper R Superscript nv ∈Rn we can write 
left parenthesis d e Subscript i Baseline right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals sigma summation Underscript j equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts left parenthesis omega Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis v right parenthesis e Subscript j Baseline period(dei)p(v) =

where omega Subscript i jωi j are n squaredn2 differential 1-forms called the connection forms of double struck upper R Superscript nRn.

d e Subscript i Baseline equals sigma summation Underscript j equals 1 Overscript n Endscripts omega Subscript i j Baseline e Subscript j Baseline perioddei =

From 
left angle bracket e Subscript i Baseline comma e Subscript j Baseline right angle bracket Subscript p Baseline equals delta Subscript i j<ei, e j>p = δi j
it results in 
left angle bracket d e Subscript i Baseline comma e Subscript j Baseline right angle bracket Subscript p Baseline plus left angle bracket e Subscript i Baseline comma d e Subscript j Baseline right angle bracket Subscript p Baseline equals omega Subscript i j Baseline plus omega Subscript j i Baseline equals 0 comma<dei, e j>p + <ei, de j>p = ωi j + ω ji = 0,
i.e. the antisymmetry of the connection form, 
omega Subscript i j Baseline equals minus omega Subscript j i Baseline periodωi j = −ω ji.
We deﬁne at eachp element of double struck upper R Superscript np ∈Rn the dual basis ofStartSet e 1 comma e 2 comma period period period comma e Subscript n Baseline EndSet{e1, e2, ..., en}, i.e. the11-differential forms 
StartSet left parenthesis omega 1 right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline comma left parenthesis omega 2 right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline comma period period period comma left parenthesis omega Subscript n Baseline right parenthesis Subscript p Baseline EndSet{(ω1)p, (ω2)p, ..., (ωn)p} such that

Let us observe that any x element of double struck upper R Superscript nx ∈Rn can be thought as an inclusion map on double struck upper R Superscript nRn to double struck upper R Superscript nRn, 
that is to say that the 11-forms left brace omega Subscript i Baseline right brace Subscript i equals 1 comma period period period comma n{ωi}i=1,...,n are dual to the moving frame left brace e Subscript i Baseline right brace Subscript i equals 1 comma period period period comma n{ei}i=1,...,n is

These structure equations above can be applied to the special case of the surfaces 
of the Euclidean space double struck upper E cubedE3. 
The immersion x colon double struck upper R Superscript n Baseline right arrow double struck upper R Superscript nx : Rn →Rn must be replaced by x colon double struck upper R squared right arrow double struck upper R cubedx : R2 →R3 which plays the 
role of a surface. 
The inner product at each point p element of double struck upper R squaredp ∈R2 is understood exactly as we saw in the 
case of surfaces, i.e.

left angle bracket v 1 comma v 2 right angle bracket colon equals left angle bracket d x Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis v 1 right parenthesis comma d x Subscript p Baseline left parenthesis v 2 right parenthesis right angle bracket Subscript x left parenthesis p right parenthesis Baseline comma<v1, v2> := <dx p(v1), dx p(v2)>x(p),
the second inner product being in double struck upper E cubed periodE3.
Of course, the image of the surface xx can be only the image of an open set upper UU of 
double struck upper R squaredR2, therefore we have the same notations as in the case of surfaces except f f , which 
now is denoted by xx. 
For p element of upper Up ∈U, we have  x left parenthesis p right parenthesis element of x left parenthesis upper U right parenthesis subset of double struck upper E cubedx(p) ∈x(U) ⊂E3. It is possible to choose in the tangent 
space of x left parenthesis upper U right parenthesisx(U) two vectors StartSet e 1 comma e 2 EndSet{e1, e2} and perpendicular to them a vector e 3e3, such that 
the set StartSet e 1 comma e 2 comma e 3 EndSet{e1, e2, e3} is a moving frame in the sense discussed above. 
Associated to these vectors there are the11-differential formsomega 1 comma omega 2 comma omega 3ω1, ω2, ω3 which are 
the dual basis and nine connection formsomega Subscript i jωi j which satisfyomega Subscript i j Baseline equals omega Subscript j i Baseline comma i comma j element of StartSet 1 comma 2 comma 3 EndSetωi j = ω ji, i, j ∈{1, 2, 3}. 
Let us write the structure equations: 
d omega 1 equals omega 2 and omega 21 plus omega 3 and omega 31dω1 = ω2 ∧ω21 + ω3 ∧ω31
d omega 2 equals omega 1 and omega 12 plus omega 3 and omega 32dω2 = ω1 ∧ω12 + ω3 ∧ω32
d omega 3 equals omega 1 and omega 13 plus omega 2 and omega 23dω3 = ω1 ∧ω13 + ω2 ∧ω23
d omega 12 equals omega 13 and omega 32dω12 = ω13 ∧ω32
d omega 13 equals omega 12 and omega 23dω13 = ω12 ∧ω23
d omega 23 equals omega 21 and omega 13dω23 = ω21 ∧ω13
Since d xdx depends only on e 1e1 and e 2e2, it results that omega 3 equals 0ω3 = 0. Then 
d omega 3 equals omega 1 and omega 13 plus omega 2 and omega 23 equals 0 commadω3 = ω1 ∧ω13 + ω2 ∧ω23 = 0,
therefore we obtain 
omega 13 equals h 11 omega 1 plus h 12 omega 2ω13 = h11ω1 + h12ω2
and 
omega 23 equals h 21 omega 1 plus h 22 omega 2ω23 = h21ω1 + h22ω2
with h 12 equals h 21 periodh12 = h21.
Let us show that the matrixleft parenthesis h Subscript i j Baseline right parenthesis(hi j) is the Weingarten matrix associated to the surface 
xx. 
We observe that our choice related to the moving frame, that is, 
d e 3 equals omega 31 e 1 plus omega 32 e 2 commade3 = ω31e1 + ω32e2,
leads to 
d e 3 left parenthesis v right parenthesis equals minus Start 2 By 2 Matrix 1st Row 1st Column h 11 2nd Column h 12 2nd Row 1st Column h 21 2nd Column h 22 EndMatrix StartBinomialOrMatrix a Choose b EndBinomialOrMatrixde3(v) = −

for any vectorv equals a 1 e 1 plus a 2 e 2 periodv = a1e1 + a2e2.It results thate 3e3 is the Gauss map. Taking into account 
that the Gaussian curvatureupper KK at each point is the determinant of the previous matrix, 
a simple computation shows that 
d omega 12 equals omega 13 and omega 32 equals minus left parenthesis h 11 h 22 minus h 12 h 21 right parenthesis omega 1 and omega 2 commadω12 = ω13 ∧ω32 = −(h11h22 −h12h21)ω1 ∧ω2,
therefore 
d omega 12 equals minus upper K omega 1 and omega 2 perioddω12 = −Kω1 ∧ω2.
In conclusion, we have another perspective offered by the differential forms via the 
structure equations for the geometry of surfaces. We can discuss about the structure 
equations in a given Minkowski space or, more generally, in the case of a coordinate 
system endowed with a metric.

linear in the ﬁrst variable. The second formula of the deﬁnition is the Leibniz rule in 
the second variable. 
The different behaviour of the two variables makes clear why the notation nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y∇XY

The next theorem is important. 
Theorem 13.5.4 For any given afﬁne connection nabla element of script upper C left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis∇∈C (M) there exists an afﬁne

left parenthesis i right parenthesis nabla Superscript 1 Baseline(i) ∇1 is a torsion-free connection; 
left parenthesis i i right parenthesis nabla Superscript 1 Baseline(ii) ∇1 has the same geodesics as the initial afﬁne connection nabla period∇.

In order to prove the symmetry of the afﬁne connectionnabla Superscript 1 Baseline∇1, we ﬁrst construct the

Therefore nabla Superscript 1 Baseline∇1 is a torsion-free connection.

2T (˙c (t) , ˙c (t)) = ∇˙c(t) ˙c (t)
it results that the two afﬁne connections have the same geodesics. 
This ends the proof.

A Geometric Description of Riemann Curvature 
Mixed Tensor via Parallel Transport 
The Riemann symbols, in the case of surfaces, were obtained by considering the 
partial derivative of Gauss formulas. The way we introduced the parallel transport of 
contravariant vectors, without using an extra dimension, allows us to think at a way 
to introduce the Riemann mixed curvature tensor without an extra dimension. 
The key of the geometric description of the curvature of an afﬁne connection is 
the parallel transport of vectors along inﬁnitesimal vectors. 
Suppose the inﬁnitesimal vector isupper A equals left parenthesis delta x Superscript 0 Baseline comma delta x Superscript 1 Baseline comma period period period comma delta x Superscript n Baseline right parenthesisA = (δx0, δx1, ..., δxn) and letupper VV be the vector 
we parallel transport along the inﬁnitesimal vectorupper AA. If we act in a Euclidean space 
where normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript k Baseline equals 0 commaTk
i j = 0, at the end we have only the vector upper A plus upper VA + V of components upper A Superscript k Baseline plus upper V Superscript kAk + V k. 
But, in general,normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript k Baseline not equals 0Tk
i j /= 0 and the parallel transport highlights the vector of components 
upper A Superscript k Baseline plus upper V Superscript k Baseline plus delta upper V Superscript kAk + V k + δV k, where 
delta upper V Superscript k Baseline equals minus normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript k Baseline upper V Superscript j Baseline delta x Superscript i Baseline periodδV k = −Tk

becomes 
delta left parenthesis d x Superscript k Baseline right parenthesis equals minus normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript k Baseline d x Superscript j Baseline delta x Superscript iδ(dxk) = −Tk

and each component of the parallel transported vector upper VV along upper AA becomes delta x Superscript k plus d x Superscript k plus delta left parenthesis d x Superscript k Baseline right parenthesisδxk +

that is,

Let us take into account the parallelogram considered above and a vector upper W equals left parenthesis upper W Superscript 0 Baseline comma upper W Superscript 1 Baseline comma period period comma upper W Superscript n Baseline right parenthesisW =
(W 0, W 1, .., W n). We consider the parallel transport of upper WW along the ﬁrst two sides. 
Alongupper AA we ﬁrst obtain the vectorupper XX of coordinatesupper X Superscript k Baseline colon equals upper A Superscript k plus left parenthesis upper W Superscript k Baseline plus delta upper W Superscript k Baseline right parenthesisXk := Ak + (W k + δW k). Then, 
this vector is parallel transported alongupper VV . We obtain the vector of coordinatesupper V Superscript k Baseline plus left parenthesis upper X Superscript k Baseline plus d upper X Superscript k Baseline right parenthesisV k +
(Xk + d Xk). Therefore the parallel transport of upper WW along the ﬁrst two sides leads to 
the vector of coordinates

and the parallel transport of upper YY along upper AA leads to the vector of coordinates 
upper A Superscript k Baseline plus left parenthesis upper Y Superscript k Baseline plus delta upper Y Superscript k Baseline right parenthesis periodAk + (Y k + δY k).
Therefore the parallel transport ofupper WW along the other two sides leads to the vector of

2 := Ak + [V k + (W k + dW k) + δ(V k + (W k + dW k))] (2)
We continue to work in coordinates. The relation which allows us to consider the 
initial parallelogram is d upper A Superscript k Baseline equals delta upper V Superscript k Baseline periodd Ak = δV k. If we denote by 
upper R colon equals upper T 2 Superscript k Baseline minus upper T 1 Superscript k Baseline commaR := T k

it results in

13.7 
The Levi-Civita Connection 
We consider a metric tensor gg in the sense described in the chapter dedicated to the 
basic Differential Geometry. 
Deﬁnition 13.7.1 An afﬁne connection nabla element of script upper C left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis∇∈C (M) which fulﬁlls the relation 
upper X left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis right parenthesis minus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis minus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Z comma upper Y right parenthesis equals 0X (g (Y, Z)) −g (∇XY, Z) −g (∇X Z, Y) = 0
for all upper X comma upper Y comma upper Z element of script upper X left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis commaX, Y, Z ∈X (M) , is called a metric connection of upper MM. 
The previous condition can be written in the simpliﬁed form nabla Subscript upper X Baseline g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis equals 0 period∇Xg(Y, Z) = 0.
Therefore 
nabla Subscript upper X Baseline g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis colon equals upper X left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis right parenthesis minus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis minus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Z comma upper Y right parenthesis∇Xg(Y, Z) := X (g (Y, Z)) −g (∇XY, Z) −g (∇X Z, Y)
is in fact an abstract covariant derivative formula of the metric tensor. At the same 
time, this formula is a compatibility condition between the metric and the connection. 
Theorem 13.7.2 For each metric tensorgg, a unique torsion-free metric connection 
nabla element of script upper C left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis∇∈C (M) exists such that nabla Subscript upper X Baseline g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis equals 0∇Xg(Y, Z) = 0 for all upper X comma upper Y comma upper Z element of script upper X left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis periodX, Y, Z ∈X (M) .
Proof Let us ﬁrst look at the uniqueness of the torsion-free metric connection 
asserted by the previous statement. 
The torsion-free condition may be written in the formnabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Z equals nabla Subscript upper Z Baseline upper X plus left bracket upper X comma upper Z right bracket∇X Z = ∇Z X + [X, Z] and 
replaced in the formula above. We obtain 
upper X left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis right parenthesis equals g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis plus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper Z Baseline upper X comma upper Y right parenthesis plus g left parenthesis left bracket upper X comma upper Z right bracket comma upper Y right parenthesis periodX (g (Y, Z)) = g (∇XY, Z) + g (∇Z X, Y) + g ([X, Z] , Y) .
Consider upper X right arrow upper Y right arrow upper Z right arrow upper XX →Y →Z →X and the corresponding relations 
upper Y left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper Z comma upper X right parenthesis right parenthesis equals g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper Y Baseline upper Z comma upper X right parenthesis plus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis plus g left parenthesis left bracket upper Y comma upper X right bracket comma upper Z right parenthesis semicolonY (g (Z, X)) = g (∇Y Z, X) + g (∇XY, Z) + g ([Y, X] , Z) ;
upper Z left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper X comma upper Y right parenthesis right parenthesis equals g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper Z Baseline upper X comma upper Y right parenthesis plus g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper Y Baseline upper Z comma upper X right parenthesis plus g left parenthesis left bracket upper Z comma upper Y right bracket comma upper X right parenthesis periodZ (g (X, Y)) = g (∇Z X, Y) + g (∇Y Z, X) + g ([Z, Y] , X) .
Adding the ﬁrst two and subtracting the last it results 
StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column 2 g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis 2nd Column equals upper X left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis right parenthesis plus upper Y left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper Z comma upper X right parenthesis right parenthesis minus upper Z left parenthesis g left parenthesis upper X comma upper Y right parenthesis right parenthesis minus g left parenthesis left bracket upper X comma upper Z right bracket comma upper Y right parenthesis 2nd Row 1st Column Blank 2nd Column plus g left parenthesis left bracket upper Z comma upper Y right bracket comma upper X right parenthesis minus g left parenthesis left bracket upper Y comma upper X right bracket comma upper Z right parenthesis period EndLayout2g (∇XY, Z) = X (g (Y, Z)) + Y (g (Z, X)) −Z (g (X, Y)) −g ([X, Z] , Y)
+ g ([Z, Y] , X) −g ([Y, X] , Z) .
If, by absurdum, there exist two connectionsnabla comma nabla Superscript 1 Baseline∇, ∇1 which fulﬁll the previous formula, 
on subtracting, we obtain 
2 g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis minus 2 g left parenthesis nabla Subscript upper X Superscript 1 Baseline upper Y comma upper Z right parenthesis equals 0 comma for all upper X comma upper Y comma upper Z element of script upper X left parenthesis upper M right parenthesis comma2g (∇XY, Z) −2g

The existence is related to the above formula,

We recognize the Christoffel symbol’s deﬁnition and it is important to mention that 
Christoffel obtained the same results as Levi-Civita even before. He published them 
in Crelle’s Journal in 1869. The results of Levi-Civita regarding the parallel trans-
port and the covariant derivative were published in 1917 in Rendiconti del Circolo 
Matematico di Palermo. In the context of the Levi-Civita connection, all tensors 
considered in the abstract Differential Geometry can be described via the Christoffel 
symbols seen here.

Coordinate Changes for Geometric Objects 
Generated by the Levi-Civita Connection 
We use the same notations as we used in the two Differential Geometry chapters of the 
book. According to the previous subsection, the Levi-Civita connection will produce, 
in coordinates, the ﬁrst and second kind of Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel 
symbols of the second kind are involved in the description of the second Riemann 
symbols. This can be also seen as the description in coordinates of the curvature of 
an afﬁne connection, while the metric will be again implied to deﬁne the Riemann 
symbols of the ﬁrst kind, the Ricci symbols, the Ricci mixed symbols, and the Ricci

Some Remarks on the Mathematical Language 
of Metric-Afﬁne Gravity 
Before developing the Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity, in particular the Telepar-
allel Gravity, we want to show that the above mathematical tools can be perfectly 
adopted for a formulation more general than the standard metric one. In this section, 
we summarize some useful results and formulas which will be fully developed in the 
next chapter. 
Let us start from the Levi-Civita connection. In coordinates, if 
upper X colon equals StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction comma upper Y colon equals StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction comma upper Z colon equals StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction commaX :=

,
then 
2 g left parenthesis normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript r Baseline StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x Superscript r Baseline EndFraction comma StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction right parenthesis equals StartFraction partial differential g Subscript j k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFraction plus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i k Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript j Baseline EndFraction minus StartFraction partial differential g Subscript i j Baseline Over partial differential x Superscript k Baseline EndFraction comma2g

that is, the Christoffel symbols emerge. Let us modify this statement in the new 
notation. Instead of 
upper X colon equals StartFraction partial differential Over partial differential x Superscript i Baseline EndFractionX :=
∂
∂xi
we write 
upper X colon equals partial differential Subscript i Baseline periodX := ∂i.
Therefore we have: 
if 
upper X colon equals partial differential Subscript i Baseline comma upper Y colon equals partial differential Subscript j Baseline comma upper Z colon equals partial differential Subscript k Baseline commaX := ∂i, Y := ∂j, Z := ∂k,
nabla Subscript upper X Baseline upper Y equals nabla Subscript partial differential Sub Subscript i Subscript Baseline partial differential Subscript j Baseline colon equals normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript r Baseline partial differential Subscript r Baseline comma∇XY = ∇∂i∂j := Tr

,
then 
2 g left parenthesis normal upper Gamma Subscript i j Superscript r Baseline partial differential Subscript r Baseline comma partial differential Subscript k Baseline right parenthesis equals partial differential Subscript i Baseline g Subscript j k Baseline plus partial differential Subscript j Baseline g Subscript i k Baseline minus partial differential Subscript k Baseline g Subscript i j Baseline period2g

13.9.1 
From Latin to Greek Indexes and Vice Versa 
An important remark is in order at this point. In the following chapter, we will 
consider Greek indexes for coordinates and Latin indexes for tetrads. This formalism 
allows us to pass from space-time (holonomic) coordinates to tetradic (anholonomic)
458

More Than Metric: Geometric Objects for Alternative Pictures of Gravity
coordinates. The physical reasons for this change is a wide ﬁeld of debate which we 
will take into account in the next chapter. For a detailed discussion see [ 9, 45]. 
With this perspective in mind, let us deﬁne objects in space-time coordinates with 
Greek indexes. Accordingly, the metric invariant, given by the metric tensor g Subscript mu nugμν, is  
written in the form 
normal d s squared equals g Subscript mu nu Baseline normal d x Superscript mu Baseline normal d x Superscript nu Baseline periodds2 = gμνdxμdxν.
The covariant derivative nabla Subscript nu Baseline∇ν acts on contravariant vector ﬁelds, denoted here by upper A Superscript muAμ,

and for covariant vector ﬁelds, i.e. for differential 11-forms, as 
nabla Subscript nu Baseline upper A Subscript mu Baseline colon equals partial differential Subscript nu Baseline upper A Subscript mu Baseline minus normal upper Gamma Subscript nu mu Superscript alpha Baseline upper A Subscript alpha Baseline period∇ν Aμ := ∂ν Aμ −Tα

Other covariant derivatives can be written accordingly.

metric curvature for our set of coordinates, and also the torsion of the connection. It is

and a simple computation leads to 
upper R Subscript beta gamma delta Superscript alpha Baseline equals minus upper R Subscript beta delta gamma Superscript alpha Baseline periodRα
βγδ = −Rα
βδγ.
In the same way, we can derive the Bianchi identities. In case of symmetric connec-
tion, we have the ﬁrst Bianchi identity: 
upper R Subscript beta gamma delta Superscript alpha Baseline plus upper R Subscript gamma delta beta Superscript alpha Baseline plus upper R Subscript delta beta gamma Superscript alpha Baseline equals 0 commaRα
βγδ + Rα
γδβ + Rα
δβγ = 0 ,
and the second Bianchi identity:

νβγ + ∇β Rμ
νγα + ∇γ Rμ
ναβ = 0 ,
as presented in the Differential Geometry chapter. Clearly, in presence of torsion, 
the right-hand side of the second Bianchi identity is not zero but it results in a 
combination of Riemann and torsion tensors. It is 
nabla Subscript lamda Baseline upper R Subscript beta mu nu Superscript alpha Baseline plus nabla Subscript mu Baseline upper R Subscript beta nu lamda Superscript alpha Baseline plus nabla Subscript nu Baseline upper R Subscript beta lamda mu Superscript alpha Baseline equals minus upper T Subscript mu lamda Superscript rho Baseline upper R Subscript beta rho nu Superscript alpha Baseline minus upper T Subscript nu lamda Superscript rho Baseline upper R Subscript beta rho mu Superscript alpha Baseline minus upper T Subscript nu mu Superscript rho Baseline upper R Subscript beta rho lamda Superscript alpha Baseline comma∇λRα

as it can be derived with some algebra. This exercise is left to the reader and will be 
reconsidered in the next chapter. 
We can rise and lower indexes using the metric tensor. Fromupper A Subscript beta Superscript alphaAα
β, we get theleft parenthesis 2 comma 0 right parenthesis(2, 0)
tensor upper A Superscript gamma alphaAγα by the rule 
upper A Superscript gamma alpha Baseline equals g Superscript gamma lamda Baseline upper A Subscript lamda Superscript alpha Baseline commaAγα = gγλAα

or the left parenthesis 0 comma 2 right parenthesis(0, 2) tensor upper A Subscript gamma alphaAγα by the rule 
upper A Subscript gamma alpha Baseline equals g Subscript gamma lamda Baseline upper A Subscript alpha Superscript lamda Baseline periodAγα = gγλAλ
α.
The case of objects asupper A Subscript alpha beta gammaAαβγ is more interesting. We can rise each index but we have 
to take care of its position. Let us see some examples. 
upper A Subscript beta gamma Superscript mu Baseline colon equals g Superscript mu alpha Baseline upper A Subscript alpha beta gamma Baseline commaAμ
βγ := gμα Aαβγ,
while in the case of the second index, we have 
upper A Subscript alpha gamma Superscript mu Baseline colon equals g Superscript mu beta Baseline upper A Subscript alpha beta gamma Baseline periodAμ
α γ := gμβ Aαβγ.
The same, in the case of the third index, 
upper A Subscript alpha beta Superscript mu Baseline colon equals g Superscript mu gamma Baseline upper A Subscript alpha beta gamma Baseline periodAμ
αβ := gμγ Aαβγ.
Therefore an expression like

upper A Subscript alpha gamma Superscript mu Baseline minus upper A Subscript alpha gamma Superscript muAμ

αγ
is not necessary 00 in the case when the initial upper A Subscript alpha beta gammaAαβγ has supplementary properties as 
we will see below. 
We can proceed in the same way for the commutator of covariant derivatives. We 
obtain 
left bracket nabla Subscript mu Baseline comma nabla Subscript nu Baseline right bracket upper V Subscript alpha Baseline equals upper R Subscript alpha beta mu nu Baseline upper V Superscript beta Baseline minus upper T Subscript mu nu Superscript beta Baseline nabla Subscript beta Baseline upper V Subscript alpha[∇μ, ∇ν]Vα = RαβμνV β −T β
μν∇βVα
and 
left bracket nabla Subscript mu Baseline comma nabla Subscript nu Baseline right bracket upper V Subscript alpha Baseline equals minus upper R Subscript beta alpha mu nu Baseline upper V Superscript beta Baseline minus upper T Subscript mu nu Superscript beta Baseline nabla Subscript beta Baseline upper V Subscript alpha Baseline comma[∇μ, ∇ν]Vα = −RβαμνV β −T β
μν∇βVα,
so we can deduce 
upper R Subscript alpha beta mu nu Baseline equals minus upper R Subscript beta alpha mu nu Baseline periodRαβμν = −Rβαμν.
Since the antisymmetry is relevant in presence of torsion, this property can play a 
very important role in Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity, as we will see in the next 
chapter. 
In these theories, the components of the Levi-Civita connection are denoted by 
StartBinomialOrMatrix rho Choose mu nu EndBinomialOrMatrix colon equals one half g Superscript rho lamda Baseline left parenthesis partial differential Subscript mu Baseline g Subscript lamda nu Baseline plus partial differential Subscript nu Baseline g Subscript mu lamda Baseline minus partial differential Subscript lamda Baseline g Subscript mu nu Baseline right parenthesis period
{ ρ
μν
}
:= 1
2gρλ(∂μgλν + ∂νgμλ −∂λgμν).
Let us remember that, if the connection is Levi-Civita, we have 
nabla Subscript mu Baseline g Subscript nu rho Baseline equals 0 period∇μgνρ = 0.
This property is the isometry already discussed above in another framework. Isometry 
is related, in this way, to the Equivalence Principle. If isometry does not hold, that 
is if the connectionnabla∇is arbitrary and not compatible with the metric, we can deﬁne 
the non-metricity tensor 
upper Q Subscript mu nu rho Baseline colon equals nabla Subscript mu Baseline g Subscript nu rho Baseline equals partial differential Subscript mu Baseline g Subscript nu rho Baseline minus normal upper Gamma Subscript nu mu Superscript lamda Baseline g Subscript lamda rho Baseline minus normal upper Gamma Subscript rho mu Superscript lamda Baseline g Subscript nu lamda Baseline periodQμνρ := ∇μgνρ = ∂μgνρ −Tλ
νμgλρ −Tλ
ρμgνλ.
We can adopt the notation: 
upper A Subscript left parenthesis mu nu right parenthesis Baseline equals upper A Subscript mu nu Baseline plus upper A Subscript nu muA(μν) = Aμν + Aνμ
for symmetric objects and 
upper A Subscript left bracket mu nu right bracket Baseline equals upper A Subscript mu nu Baseline minus upper A Subscript nu muA[μν] = Aμν −Aνμ
for anti-symmetric objects. Using the ﬁrst formula, we can write the non-metricity 
tensor as 
upper Q Subscript mu nu rho Baseline colon equals nabla Subscript mu Baseline g Subscript nu rho Baseline identical to partial differential Subscript mu Baseline g Subscript nu rho Baseline minus normal upper Gamma Subscript left parenthesis nu vertical bar mu Superscript lamda Baseline g Subscript rho right parenthesis lamda Baseline periodQμνρ := ∇μgνρ ≡∂μgνρ −Tλ
(ν|μgρ)λ.
Using the second formula, one can write the torsion tensor upper T Subscript beta gamma Superscript alpha Baseline equals normal upper Gamma Subscript beta gamma Superscript alpha Baseline minus normal upper Gamma Subscript gamma beta Superscript alphaT α
βγ = Tα
βγ −Tα

[βγ].
An important remark is in order at this point. If torsion and non-metricity are different

In the next chapter, we will discuss in detail this extension. 
Another important notion we are going to discuss is that of the tetrad ﬁelds 
or the vierbein, that is, the “four-legs” [ 9]. They are the fundamental variables of 
Teleparallel Gravity. 
We can suppose that, at each point of the tangent space of a given44-manifold, there 
are four vector ﬁeldsleft parenthesis e Subscript a Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis comma(eμ

an orthonormal basis with respect to the metric tensorg Subscript mu nugμν. This means the following 
relation is fulﬁlled: 
g Subscript mu nu Baseline e Subscript a Superscript mu Baseline e Subscript b Superscript nu Baseline equals eta Subscript a b Baseline periodgμνeμ

b = ηab.
Hereeta Superscript alpha beta Baseline equals eta Subscript alpha beta Baseline equals normal d normal i normal a normal g left parenthesis negative 1 comma 1 comma 1 comma 1 right parenthesisηαβ = ηαβ = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1) are the components of the ﬂat Minkowski metric 
of signature left parenthesis minus plus plus plus right parenthesis period(−+ ++). If we deﬁne by left parenthesis e Subscript mu Superscript a Baseline right parenthesis(ea
μ), the inverse of the vector left parenthesis e Subscript a Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesis(eμ

compute the metric components by the formulas 
g Subscript mu nu Baseline equals e Subscript mu Superscript a Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript b Baseline eta Subscript a b Baseline comma g Superscript mu nu Baseline equals e Subscript a Superscript mu Baseline e Subscript b Superscript nu Baseline eta Superscript a b Baseline periodgμν = ea

Consider a Lorentz rotation. Therefore consider a matrix who keeps invariant the 
Minkowski metric written in the form 
d s squared equals minus d t squared plus d x squared plus d y squared plus d z squared periodds2 = −dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
This Lorentz rotation transforms the tetrad ﬁeld according to the rule

because this is the only way we can preserve the orthonormal basis. This suggests 
that, if we have a matrix with two kinds of indexes, Latin (anholonomic) and Greek 
(holonomic), the tetrad ﬁeld helps us to construct tensor quantities with the same 
kind of indexes. An example is 
upper A Subscript b 1 b 2 period period period b Sub Subscript n Subscript Superscript a 1 a 2 period period period a Super Subscript n Superscript Baseline equals e Subscript alpha 1 Superscript a 1 Baseline e Subscript alpha 2 Superscript a 2 Baseline period period period e Subscript alpha Sub Subscript n Subscript Superscript a Super Subscript n Superscript Baseline upper A Subscript beta 1 beta 2 period period period beta Sub Subscript n Subscript Superscript alpha 1 alpha 2 period period period alpha Super Subscript n Superscript Baseline e Subscript b 1 Superscript beta 1 Baseline e Subscript b 2 Superscript beta 2 Baseline period period period e Subscript b Sub Subscript n Subscript Superscript beta Super Subscript n Superscript Baseline periodAa1a2...an

These arguments will be reconsidered in detail in the forthcoming chapter. 
Finally, we can introduce new coefﬁcients omega Subscript mu b Superscript aωa
μb to extend the parallel transport to 
more general quantities. We adopt the following notation. For Greek indexes, we

Tetrad ﬁeld can change the index type. If we want to commute with respect to the 
covariant derivative of a tensor, we get the condition:

which means the vanishing of the new covariant derivative of the tetrad. 
In other words, we can deﬁne the Lorentz covariant derivative with respect to the 
Latin indexes only, denoted by script upper D Subscript muDμ. It is  
normal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript rho Baseline equals e Subscript a Superscript rho Baseline left parenthesis partial differential Subscript mu Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript a Baseline plus omega Subscript mu b Superscript a Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript b Baseline right parenthesis identical to e Subscript a Superscript rho Baseline script upper D Subscript mu Baseline periodTρ

In particular, if one ﬁnds the spin connection omegaω corresponding to the Levi-Civita

To conclude, we have now all the ingredients to deal with Metric-Afﬁne Theories 
of Gravity which we will discuss in detail in the next chapter.

Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity 
The development of Physics, like the development of any 
science, is a continuous one. 
Owen Chamberlain 
General Relativity is not the end of the story. Several issues, ranging from Quantum 
Gravity to the Dark Side of the Universe need to be addressed in a self-consistent 
theory. Here we want to summarize some of these approaches. In particular, we want 
to show that the same theory, General Relativity, can be represented in different 
ways. This fact is questioning the basic foundations of the theory like the Equiva-
lence Principle, the Lorentz Invariance, and so on. According to this picture, new 
possibilities can be taken into account in view of further theoretical and experimental 
developments. Topics of this chapter are more advanced with respect to the rest of 
the book and could be considered for some short advanced lectures. 
14.1 
A Survey on Theories of Gravity 
In the nineteenth century, Newtonian mechanics was considered as the best theory 
to describe gravity, since it was successfully exploited in everyday life and capable 
of describing the motion of planets and stars. However, in this period, there was a 
great cultural ferment around non-Euclidean geometries starting from fundamen-
tal works by Gauss, Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Riemann, Bianchi, Ricci-Curbastro, and 
several others [ 29]. The Euclidean framework, the arena for classical Physics, was 
overtaken by the formulation of elliptical and hyperbolic geometries, stemming out 
from a rigorous axiomatic reformulation of the geometry foundations. Indeed, two

Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity
approaches were more and more emerging from these studies: left parenthesis i right parenthesis(i) afﬁne geometry, 
introduced by Euler in 1748, deriving from the Latin word afﬁnis, meaning related, 
and after promoted by Möbius, Klein, and Weyl. It essentially focuses on the study 
of parallel lines, based on the validity or redeﬁnition of the ﬁfth Euclid postulate, 
and on the afﬁne transformations [ 24]; left parenthesis i i right parenthesis(ii) metric geometry, introduced by Fréchet 
and Hausdorff, relies on a metric function deﬁning the concept of distance between 
any two points, members of a non-empty set [ 43]. 
Einstein, inspired by this line of nonconformist ideas, arrived, in 1915, to the for-
mulation of General Relativity (GR) [ 91]. This new vision of gravitational interaction, 
ruled by the space–time curvature, took time to be comprehended and accepted by 
the scientiﬁc community owed to the outcoming effects, retained to be too small to 
be measured and observed at that time. The well-known subsequent astronomical 
conﬁrmations constituted the success of GR [195]. 
Although GR was not yet validated, some authors were however eager to advance 
proposals to extend it with the aim to fulﬁl more general purposes. In 1918, Weyl 
started to study the question on how to connect gravity and electromagnetism in a 
single and coherent geometric theory. To achieve this objective, he took into account 
an additional gauge ﬁeld, which singles out a unique length connection, whose four 
additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) are associated to the electromagnetic poten-
tials. In the Weyl geometry, besides the GR connection, there is also an additional 
length connection, which is symmetric, metric incompatible, and gauge invariant. 
The consequence is that, during a parallel transport, both direction and length of 
vectors vary [192, 193]. However, Weyl’s theory revealed to be in conﬂict not only 
with some experiences (for example, the frequency of spectral lines of atomic clocks 
depends on the location and past histories of the atoms), but even in a more fun-
damental way with Quantum Mechanics (e.g. masses of particles rest on their past 
histories). 
In 1930, along the same line of thinking, Einstein himself proposed some modiﬁ-
cations to his theory. Fascinated by teleparallelism and tetrad formalism, he initiated 
a proliﬁc and extensive correspondence mainly with Cartan, Weitzenböck, and Lanc-
zos [109, 110, 188]. Indeed, since the tetrad ﬁelds posses sixteen independent com-
ponents, he associated ten of them to the metric tensor, whereas the other six were 
believed to be linked to a separate connection, entrusted to model electromagnetic 
potentials. Unfortunately, he failed in his attempt, but his studies shed new light on 
the importance of additional DoFs, which theoretically belong to the Lorentz group 
and physically are a consequence of the local Lorentz invariance. 
In 1922, Cartan concentrated on a different direction, since he considered a natural 
extension of GR constituted not only by the Levi-Civita connection but also by the 
torsion tensor (essentially the antisymmetric part of a metric compatible afﬁne con-
nection). Given these premises, he developed all the ensuing geometric formulation 
[ 74], where he suggested that the torsion can be physically related to the intrinsic 
(quantum) angular momentum of matter and it vanishes as soon as vacuum regions 
are considered [ 69– 73].
14.1 A Survey on Theories of Gravity
465
Around 1960, Kibble and Sciama revisited the theory formulating it within the 
gauge theory of the Poincaré group [119, 123, 170]. This approach can be extended 
to the more general afﬁne group, leading thus to the metric-afﬁne gauge gravity 
[115]. 
There have been other proposals and experiments to probe the fundamental nature 
of gravitation, in particular, to establish its geometric structure. In this vein, it was 
growing the awareness that afﬁnity and metricity could be considered as two different 
and independent concepts, where the afﬁne connection could not respect a priori the 
metric postulate. This perspective is considered into the so-called Palatini approach, 
where GR is constituted by a metric tensor and an afﬁne connection, considered as two 
different geometric structures. Varying the Einstein–Hilbert action with respect to the 
metric, the Einstein ﬁeld equations are recovered; whereas, varying it with respect 
to the afﬁne connection, the metric compatibility condition is naturally obtained and 
the Levi-Civita connection is restored [157]. This shows that GR structure entails 
metric compatibility, and the afﬁne connection can be considered as a true dynamical 
ﬁeld. As it is well known, this coincidence does not work for extensions of GR as 
f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) [ 10]. 
These considerations led to the development of theories of gravity beyond the 
Einstein picture, where the ﬁeld equations, besides the scalar curvature, can be for-
mulated in terms of other geometric invariants. Furthermore, the afﬁne connections 
were not considered anymore with an ancillary role with respect to the metric ten-
sor, but, contrarily, they assumed a dynamical fundamental role. These approaches 
gave rise to the current variegated realm of the Extended and Alternative Theories 
of Gravity (see e.g. [ 45, 51, 55, 61, 78, 147, 148, 150, 172]). 
In any case, GR revealed to be extraordinarily successful because passed several 
astrophysical and cosmological observational tests like the Solar System tests [ 85, 
146, 195], the direct detection of gravitational waves [ 2– 4, 19, 168], the recent black 
hole imaging [ 6, 94– 99, 156], and other robust conﬁrmations [ 76, 111, 128, 174]. 
Despite these achievements, the theory exhibits various pathological issues, still 
matter of debate, suggesting that approaches beyond Einstein gravity should be pur-
sued [ 55]. For example, from galaxies to cosmic evolution, the infrared behaviour 
of gravitational ﬁeld presents several shortcomings mainly related to the Dark Mat-
ter [ 15, 48, 65, 139] and Dark Energy problems [ 51, 68, 80], and the tensions in 
cosmological parameters like upper H 0H0 [ 11, 87]. At ultraviolet scales, the lack of renor-
malizability and unitarity of gravitational ﬁeld points out that a ﬁnal, self-consistent 
theory of Quantum Gravity is not at hand [ 63, 106, 107, 153, 164, 180, 181]. 
In general, the formulation of a new theory of gravity to solve the above issues 
is not a simple task. There are principles, constraints, mathematical consistencies, 
and the agreement with observations that any novel approach must necessarily fulﬁll 
before being accepted as a self-consistent picture. This is one of the thorny theoretical 
challenges of modern physics. 
In this perspective, we want to focus our attention on GR and its dynamically 
equivalent formulations, in view to put in evidence similarities and differences 
towards a uniﬁed view of gravitational interaction.

Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity
This chapter is organized as follows: in Sect. 14.2, we describe the general frame-
work, represented by the metric-afﬁne theories of gravity, in which the so-called 
Geometric Trinity of Gravity [ 23] can be formulated (Sect. 14.3). In Sect. 14.4, we  
provide the mathematical tools necessary for the formulation of any theory of gravity. 
In Sect. 14.5, we discuss the Geometric Trinity of Gravity in terms of their Lagrangian 
equivalence. Section 14.6 is devoted to the ﬁeld equations derived from the second 
Bianchi identity. In Sect. 14.7, we analyse the spherically symmetric solutions in the 
three equivalent formulations, recovering, in all of them, the Schwarzschild metric 
and the Birkhoff theorem. Finally, Sect. 14.8 is devoted to the conclusions and to 
the discussion of some crucial issues necessary for any self-consistent formulation 
of gravity. 
Notations. We adopt the metric signature left parenthesis minus comma plus comma plus comma plus right parenthesis(−, +, +, +). Greek indexes take val-
ues 0 comma 1 comma 2 comma 30, 1, 2, 3, while the lowercase Latin ones 1 comma 2 comma 31, 2, 3. Capital Latin letters indicate 
tetrad indexes The ﬂat metric is indicated by eta Superscript alpha beta Baseline equals eta Subscript alpha beta Baseline equals normal d normal i normal a normal g left parenthesis negative 1 comma 1 comma 1 comma 1 right parenthesisηαβ = ηαβ = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). The  
determinant of the metric g Subscript mu nugμν is denoted by gg. Round (square) brackets around 
a pair of indexes stand for symmetrization (antisymmetrization) procedure, i.e. 
upper A Subscript left parenthesis i j right parenthesis Baseline equals upper A Subscript i j Baseline plus upper A Subscript j iA(i j) = Ai j + A ji (upper A Subscript left bracket i j right bracket Baseline equals upper A Subscript i j Baseline minus upper A Subscript j iA[i j] = Ai j −A ji). 
In this chapter, we will number the formulas to avoid to report them several times 
along the discussion. 
14.2 
Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity 
A ﬁrst extension of Einstein gravity starts by generalizing the afﬁne connections 
which cannot be strictly Levi-Civita. A metric-afﬁne theory is deﬁned by the follow-
ing triplet StartSet script upper M comma g Subscript mu nu Baseline comma normal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript rho Baseline EndSet{M, gμν, ┌ρ
μν}, where script upper MM is a four-dimensional space–time manifold, g Subscript mu nugμν
is a rank-two symmetric tensor (with 10 independent components), and normal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript rho┌ρ
μν is the 
afﬁne connection (endowed with 64 independent components). A priori  there is no 
relation between the metric and the afﬁne connection, where the former is responsible 
to describe the casual structure, whereas the latter deals with the geodesic structure. 
As it is well known, the structures coincide if the Equivalence Principle is the basic 
foundation of the theory [ 55, 195]. 
Let us consider now a system of coordinatesStartSet x 0 comma x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 EndSet{x0, x1, x2, x3} deﬁned onscript upper MM, where 
x 0x0 labels the time andStartSet x 1 comma x 2 comma x 3 EndSet{x1, x2, x3} the space. The metricg Subscript mu nugμν deﬁnes the line element

The above geometric quantities, differently affect the parallel transport of a vector 
on a manifold. We have that: 
• curvature manifests its presence when a vector is parallel transported along a 
closed curve on a non-ﬂat background and comes back to its starting point forming 
a non-null angle with its initial position; 
• torsion entails a rotational geometry, where the parallel transport of two vectors is 
antisymmetric by exchanging the transported vectors and the direction of transport. 
This property results in the non-closure of parallelograms; 
• non-metricity is responsible to alter the length of the vectors along the transport. 
In a generic metric-afﬁne theory, all these effects can work together and could have 
also further meanings corresponding to physical quantities (e.g. the torsion tensor is 
linked to the spin in the Einstein–Cartan theory [119]).

(1) The Riemann–Cartan geometry is expressed in terms of metric compatible cur-
vature and torsion tensors. It is also known in the literature as upper U 4U4 or Einstein– 
Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory, where the role of the torsion is deputed to model 
the quantum spin effects present in the matter [116–119]. 
(2) The Weyl geometry is constructed by vanishing the torsion, where curvature 
and non-metricity are the only surviving geometric objects. This theory has 
interesting implications and, moreover, it represents also the origin of the upper U left parenthesis 1 right parenthesisU(1)
gauge theory [194]. 
(3) Teleparallel geometries are curvatureless and are based on the concept of Fer-
nparallelismus or parallelism at distance, because two vectors can be immedi-
ately seen whether they are parallel or not, since the parallel transport of vectors 
becomes independent of the path [ 9]. They admit two special subclasses, repre-

(3.2) symmetric teleparallel theories described only by the non-metricity tensor. 
(4) The Riemannian geometry represents the ﬁrst arena within which Einstein 
framed his theory, constructed only upon the curvature tensor [140, 162]. 
(5) The Minkowski geometry is obtained by setting curvature, torsion, and non-
metricity to zero, where the ﬂat metric eta Subscript mu nuημν, as well as zero afﬁne connections, 
are adopted. This is the arena of Special Relativity [140, 162]. 
14.3 
The Geometric Trinity of Gravity 
Among the possible metric-afﬁne gravity theories, Riemannian and teleparallel mod-
els are particularly interesting. GR is an example of Riemannian geometry, whereas 
the so-called metric teleparallel equivalent of GR (TEGR) and symmetric teleparallel 
equivalent of GR (STEGR) are examples of teleparallel geometries. See Fig. 14.2. 
These three theories constitute the so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity. 
A fundamental property of TEGR is that torsion replaces curvature for dynam-
ics and it is able to provide the same descriptions of the gravitational interaction 
under a different perspective. In GR, the geometric curvature is entrusted to model 
the gravitational force, whereas geodesics coincide with the free-falling test parti-
cle’s trajectories. On the other hand, in TEGR, the gravitational interaction emerges 
through the torsion tensor and acts as a (gauge) force. This is the reason why, in 
the teleparallel framework, the concept of geodesics is replaced by force equations, 
analogously to what happens in electrodynamics where the Lorentz force is present. 
STEGR shares several similar properties with TEGR. In this theory, one requires 
that curvature and torsion are both zero, and gravitational dynamics is attributed to 
the non-metricity tensor. 
GR is described in terms of the metric g Subscript mu nugμν; TEGR in terms of the tetrads e Subscript mu Superscript upper AeA

ricg Subscript mu nugμν and afﬁne connectionnormal upper Gamma Subscript alpha beta Superscript mu┌μ
αβ are two separated dynamical structures. Like other 
fundamental interactions in Nature, gravitation can be reformulated as a gauge the-
ory through TEGR and STEGR. The most peculiar property of gravitation seems to 
be its universal character that all objects, regardless of their internal structure, feel 
this force, which is encoded in the Equivalence Principle of GR. In the teleparallel 
formulations, the Equivalence Principle is sometimes claimed to be not valid in the 
literature, instead, we will underline how it can be recovered in such theories, also 
if it does not lie at their foundation. This fact is extremely relevant because, if the 
Equivalence Principle were shown to be violated at some fundamental level, the ﬁnal 
theory of gravitation could be non-metric. 
In these equivalent pictures, we can deﬁne alternative ways of representing the 
gravitational ﬁeld, accounting for the same DoFs, related to speciﬁc geometric invari-
ants: the Ricci curvature scalar upper RR, the torsion scalar upper TT , and the non-metricity scalar 
upper QQ. In this sense, GR, TEGR, and STEGR give rise to the Geometric Trinity of 
Gravity. 
Similarly to GR where we can extend to f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) gravity, f left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis f (T ) and f left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis f (Q) gravity 
are the extensions of TEGR and STEGR, respectively. It is worth noticing that, in 
general, the equivalence among the three representations is not valid anymore among 
the extensions, because they give rise to dynamics with different DoFs (see Fig. 14.3). 
In particular, inf left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) gravity to fourth-order ﬁeld equations, in metric representation, 
whereas f left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis f (T ) and f left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis f (Q) still remains of second-order [ 45, 55, 160]. In addition, in 
f left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis f (T ) andf left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis f (Q), we cannot choose, in general, a gauge to simplify the calculations, 
as in the cases of TEGR and STEGR. On the contrary, we have to consider ﬁeld 
equations for the spin connection in f left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis f (T ) and afﬁne ﬁeld equations for f left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis f (Q) [ 45, 
83, 160]. In the following, we shall develop these points in detail. 
Fig. 14.3 The Geometric Trinity of Gravity and related extensions. The equivalence holds only 
for theories linear in the scalar invariants. Extensions can involve further degrees of freedom which 
lead to the breaking of equivalence among different representations of gravity. It can be restored 
identifying correct boundary terms

Tetrads and Spin Connection 
Before going into details of Trinity Gravity, some considerations on the mathematical 
structure are in order. To deﬁne a theory of gravity, we need to ﬁx the underlying 
geometry, the transformation properties, and the set of observables. GR is based on 
the metric tensor from which we can construct the Levi-Civita connection, and ﬁnally 
the curvature, which encodes the gravitational dynamics. The possibility to relate the 
metric and the geodesic structure, which essentially coincide, relies on the validity 
of the Equivalence Principle [ 55]. However, GR can be reformulated also in terms 
of tetrad [ 9, 144, 160] and spin connection formalisms [ 9, 129], giving rise to the 
teleparallel equivalent GR. In Sect. 14.4.1, we describe in detail the tetrad formalism, 
whereas, in Sect. 14.4.2, we introduce the spin connection. 
14.4.1
The Tetrad Formalism 
The geometric setting of any theory of gravity occurs in the tangent bundle, a natural 
construction always present in any smooth space–time. In fact, at each point of the 
space–time, it is possible to construct the tangent space attached to it, which is a 
vector (ﬁbre bundle) space. On the respective domains of deﬁnition, any vector or 
covector can be expressed in terms of a general linear orthonormal frame called 
tetrads. 
A tetrad ﬁeld is a geometric construction, which permits to easily carry out the 
calculations on the tangent space. Physically, they represent the standard laboratory 
apparatus of the observer for carrying out the measurements in space and time. Using 
a tetrad ﬁeld means to adopt a Lagrangian point of view, which entails to follow an 
individual ﬂuid parcel as it moves through space and time. A tetrad ﬁeld establishes a 
relationship between the manifold and its tangent spaces. This geometric structure is 
always present, independently of any prior gravity-model assumption. The theoretical 
framework intervenes to characterize the gravitational effects occurring in this frame. 
We ﬁrst introduce the deﬁnition and properties of the tetrads (see Sect. 14.4.1), and 
then we present their anhonolonomy structure (see Sect. 14.4.1) and its importance 
in the ﬁrst Cartan structure equation (see Sect. 14.4.1). Finally, we describe preferred 
frames represented by the inertial class and trivial tetrads (see Sect. 14.4.1). 
Tetrads: Deﬁnition and Properties 
Let us assign a general metric space–time (script upper M comma g Subscript mu nu BaselineM, gμν), being script upper MM a four-dimensional 
differential manifold of classupper C Superscript normal infinityC∞, whose tangent spacesupper T Subscript p Baseline script upper MTpM, at each pointp element of script upper Mp ∈M, 
are Minkowski space–times with metriceta Subscript upper A upper BηAB, andg Subscript mu nugμν the symmetric metric tensor. In 
these hypotheses, there exists a compatible atlas of chartsscript upper AA, being an open covering

of script upper MM. Therefore, for each p element of script upper Mp ∈M, there exists a chart left parenthesis script upper U comma phi right parenthesis(U, ϕ) of domain script upper UU, being an 
open neighbourhood ofpp, and a coordinate mapphi colon script upper U right arrow phi left parenthesis script upper U right parenthesis subset of or equal to double struck upper R Superscript 4ϕ : U →ϕ(U) ⊆R4 (being a home-

[162]. Deﬁned the coordinate x Superscript muxμ-axes in double struck upper R Superscript 4R4, it is possible to construct the related 
coordinate curvesgamma Subscript x Sub Superscript muγxμ onscript upper MM via the use of the charts. Therefore, all the parallel curves

which can be related to the natural basis through [ 9]

classiﬁcation, which leads to 11 possible different space–times, useful to develop 
cosmological models [130, 166, 177].

where the anhonolonomy coefﬁcients emerge as an antisymmetric combination of

Inertial Frames and Trivial Tetrads 
Among the different frames, a special class is represented by the inertial frames, 
which can be denoted by StartSet e prime Subscript upper A EndSet

, whose coefﬁcients of anhonolonomy f Subscript upper A upper B Superscript prime upper C f ,C

AB = 0. For  Eq. (14.25) we have  normal d e Superscript prime upper A Baseline equals 0de,A = 0, which is locally 
exact and can be written as e Superscript prime upper A Baseline equals normal d x Superscript prime upper Ae,A = dx,A and therefore it is holonomic. Therefore, 
all coordinate bases belong to this family. It is worth noting that this is not a local 
property, but it holds everywhere for all frames being part of this inertial class [ 9]. 
In absence of gravitation, the anholonomy is only caused by inertial forces present 
in these frames. The metricg Subscript mu nugμν reduces to the Minkowski metriceta Subscript mu nuημν. In all coordinate 
systems,eta Subscript mu nuημν is a function of the space–time point, and independently of whetherStartSet e Subscript upper A Baseline EndSet{eA}
is holonomic (inertial) or not. In this case, tetrads always relate the tangent Minkowski

14.4 Tetrads and Spin Connection
477
Fig. 14.5 This ﬁgure shows how tetrads behave in terms of inertial and gravitational effects. When 
no gravity is present, and we consider inertial effects only (i.e. we move along geodesics), we obtain 
trivial (holonomic) tetrads, whereas, when non-inertial contributions take place (i.e. following non-
geodesic orbits), the tetrads become anholomic. The situation is analogue when gravitation is 
switched on. Along geodesic, we obtain inertial frames, whereas along non-geodesic trajectories 
we have the most general anholomic frames 
These are the frames appearing in Special Relativity, which are usually called trivial 
frames or trivial tetrads. They are very useful when we deal with spaces involving 
torsion [129]. Of course, in the absence of inertial forces, the class of inertial frames 
is, consequently, represented by vanishing structure coefﬁcients. These concepts are 
sketched in Fig. 14.5. 
14.4.2 
The Spin Connection 
The spin connection plays a fundamental role when we deal with tetrads, because it 
encodes the inertial effects occurring in the considered frame. Let us brieﬂy recall 
the fundamental properties of the Lorentz group (see Sect. 14.4.2), then we discuss 
the associated Lorentz algebra as well as its properties (see Sect. 14.4.2). Lorentz 
connections will be ﬁrst introduced under a mathematical point of view (see Sect. 
14.4.2) together with the fundamental tetrad postulate (see Sect. 14.4.2), and then 
the same subject will be considered under a physical perspective (see Sect. 14.4.2).

Metric-Afﬁne Theories of Gravity
The Lorentz Group 
Electromagnetism is framed under the standard of Special Relativity by postulating 
[162]: 
(1) the optical isotropy principle: all inertial frames are optically isotropic, i.e. the 
light propagates in these frames with velocity c equals 1 divided by StartRoot epsilon 0 mu 0 EndRootc = 1/√∈0μ0 in any direction; 
(2) the principle of relativity: the laws of physics assume the same form in all inertial 
reference frames. 
Given two inertial frames and assuming that one is moving with respect to the other 
with uniform velocitybold italic v colon equals left parenthesis v Superscript 1 Baseline comma v squared comma v cubed right parenthesisv := (v1, v2, v3), the  Lorentz transformation is a linear (afﬁne)

They are the unitary, parity, and time reversal operators, respectively. The expression 
of normal upper Lamda Subscript beta Superscript alphaɅα
β shows that a Lorentz transformation is deﬁned in terms of six parameters: 
three related to the rotation angles and the other three to the components of the spatial 
velocity vv. 
The set of all Lorentz transformations of Minkowski space–time forms the (homo-
geneous) Lorentz orthogonal groupupper O left parenthesis 1 comma 3 right parenthesisO(1, 3). The requirement (14.28), together with 
(14.27), entails, in matrix notation, that eta equals normal upper Lamda Superscript upper T Baseline eta normal upper Lamdaη = ɅT ηɅ. This gives rise to normal d normal e normal t squared normal upper Lamda equals 1det2Ʌ = 1, 
namely proper (normal d normal e normal t normal upper Lamda equals 1detɅ = 1) and improper (normal d normal e normal t normal upper Lamda equals negative 1detɅ = −1) Lorentz transformations, 
which can be further subdivided (cf. Eq. (14.29)) in orthochronous (normal upper Lamda Subscript 0 Superscript 0 Baseline greater than or equals 1Ʌ0
0 ≥1) and 
non-orthochronous (normal upper Lamda Subscript 0 Superscript 0 Baseline less than or equals negative 1Ʌ0
0 ≤−1) [134, 191]. The proper orthochronous Lorentz trans-
formations form the restricted Lorentz special orthogonal groupupper S upper O Superscript plus Baseline left parenthesis 1 comma 3 right parenthesisSO+(1, 3). There-
fore, the Lorentz group is a six-dimensional, non-compact, non-Abelian, and real 
Lie group endowed with four connected components [134, 191]. The Lorentz group 
is closely involved in all known fundamental laws of Nature describing the related
14.4 Tetrads and Spin Connection
479
symmetries of space and time. In particular, in GR, we consider the local Lorentz 
invariance, because in every small enough region of space–time, thanks to the Equiv-
alence Principle, the gravitational effects can be neglected, i.e. this occurs in the local 
inertial frame (LIF), which permits to recover the Special Relativity physics. 
At each point of a Riemannian space–time, the metricg Subscript mu nugμν determines a tetrad up 
to the local Lorentz transformations in the tangent space. In other words, a tetrad 
vector (covector) baseStartSet e Subscript upper A Baseline EndSet{eA} (StartSet e Superscript upper A Baseline EndSet

) is not unique, because it is always possible to ﬁnd 
another base StartSet e overbar Subscript upper A Baseline EndSet{¯eA} (StartSet e overbar Superscript upper A Baseline EndSet

The Derivation of Lorentz Connection 
Some geometric objects with an established behaviour may lose the covariant char-
acter under point-dependent transformations, e.g. ordinary derivative of covariant 
objects. In order to supply for this defective behaviour, it is fundamental to introduce 
connectionsomega Subscript muωμ fulﬁlling the following properties:left parenthesis i right parenthesis(i) they behave like vectors in the 
space–time indexes; left parenthesis i i right parenthesis(ii) they act as non-tensor in the algebraic indexes to compen-
sate this effect and to reestablish the correct tensorial trend. The linear connections 
fulﬁlling these requirements belong to the subgroup upper S upper O Superscript plus Baseline left parenthesis 1 comma 3 right parenthesisSO+(1, 3) of upper G upper L left parenthesis 4 comma double struck upper R right parenthesisGL(4, R), and

they are dubbed Lorentz connections. It is worth noticing that all Lorentz connections 
exhibit the presence of torsion (see Ref. [ 9], and discussions therein).

This is a crucial point, because the operations (14.41) and (14.42) are in principle

the Lorentz connections vanish, omega Superscript prime upper A upper B Baseline Subscript mu Baseline equals 0ω,ABμ = 0 for Eq. (14.50) [129].

When we pass from a frame to another one, there are two distinct contributions: 
(1) non-inertial effects connected with the new frame; and (2) inertial contributions 
due to the rotation of the new frame with respect to the previous one. Therefore, 
starting from inertial frames (omega Superscript prime upper A upper B Baseline Subscript mu Baseline equals 0ω,ABμ = 0), it is possible to obtain a class of non-inertial 
frames (cf. Eq. (14.52)) via local Lorentz transformations. It is important to note 
that all these inﬁnite frames are related through global (point-independent) Lorentz 
transformations normal upper Lamda Subscript upper B Superscript upper A Baseline equals normal c normal o normal n normal s normal tɅA

are compared and discussed. 
The notations we are going to use are the following: over-circles refer to quantities 
built up on the Levi-Civita connection (i.e.ModifyingAbove upper A With ring above Subscript nu Superscript mu

the teleparallel connection (i.e.ModifyingAbove upper A With caret Subscript nu Superscript mu

14.5 Equivalent Representations of Gravity: The Lagrangian Level
485
14.5.1 
Metric Formulation of Gravity: The Case of General 
Relativity 
The GR is the ﬁrst geometric formulation of gravity in curved space–times. We ﬁrst 
recall its basic principles (Sect. 14.5.1), and implications related to the geodesic 
equations (see Sect. 14.5.1). The fundamental geometric object is the metric tensor, 
which allows to deﬁne uniquely the Levi-Civita connection, which, in turn, deter-
mines the Riemann curvature tensor (Sect. 14.5.1, for the description of its properties 
and symmetries). Then, Lagrangian and ﬁeld equations of GR are presented in Sect. 
14.5.1. Finally, we discuss the tetrad formalism in GR (see Sect. 14.5.1). 
Principles of General Relativity 
Einstein theory is essentially based on the following pillar ideas, which can be stated 
as follows [ 55, 140, 162]: 
(1) Relativity Principle: there are no preferred inertial frames, i.e. all frames are 
good for Physics; 
(2) 
General Covariance Principle: the basic laws of Physics can be formulated 
in tensor form in any smooth four-dimensional manifold script upper MM. This means that 
ﬁeld equations must be “covariant” in form, i.e. they must be invariant under the 
action of space–time diffeomorphisms; 
(3) Equivalence Principle: in any smooth four-dimensional manifold script upper MM, it is pos-
sible to consider a small space–time regionscript upper WW where spatial and temporal gravi-
tational changes are negligible. Therefore, there always exists a LIF where grav-
itational effects can be nulliﬁed. In other words, inertial effects are locally indis-
tinguishable from gravitational effects (which means the equivalence between 
the inertial and the gravitational masses). 
(4) Causality Principle: each point of space–time has to admit a universally valid 
notion of past, present, and future. 
The ﬁrst two principles are strictly related. They conﬁgure the extension of Rel-
ativity Principle of Special Relativity to any reference frame independently of the 
acceleration state. In other words, they ﬁgure out a sort of democracy principle for 
all observers, i.e. all observers have the same right to describe the physical reality 
[162]. 
Regarding the third principle, it permits to locally recover the Physics of Special 
Relativity. Geometrically, it translates in determining the tangent plane in every 
point of a smooth manifold. Furthermore, gravity is the only interaction that cannot 
be switched off in absolute, as instead it occurs for electromagnetic and other ﬁelds. 
Therefore, the gravitational ﬁeld can be deﬁned as what remains when we have 
deactivated the other interactions in an absolute way and independently from the 
observer. It can be only locally nulliﬁed in the LIFs, physically coinciding with local

This holds if we assume that inertial and gravitational mass coincide (see Refs. [162], 
for more details). This is the (weak) equivalence principle or also known as university 
of free fall, stating that the trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational ﬁeld depends 
only on its initial position and velocity and it is independent of its composition and 
structure. Therefore, the inertial effects may be globally eliminated by an appropriate 
choice of the reference frame (see Sect. 14.4.2), whereas the gravitational ﬁeld can 
be only locally disregarded not eliminated [162]. 
The fourth principle is needed to ensure the uniqueness of the time notion despite 
of space–time deformations and singularities. As it is well known, several issues of 
modern physics are questioning the Causality Principle but we will not go into this 
discussion again here.

treatment of bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds. In GR, it is clear that a point particle 
follows the geodesic equations according to the Levi-Civita part of the connection. 
More problematic issues are linked to bosons (coupling only to the metric) and 
fermions (coupling with metric and connection). Therefore, when matter ﬁelds are 
taken into account, one must either consider minimally coupled ﬁelds or formulate 
consistent theories in metric-afﬁne formalism. For example in GR, the presence of 
fermions requires the introduction of tetrads and spin connection. 
Tetrad Formalism in General Relativity 
GR conceives the gravitational interaction as a change in the geometry of space–time 
itself, where we pass from the Minkowski eta Subscript mu nuημν to the Riemannian metric g Subscript mu nugμν, and 
from partialpartial differential∂to covariant derivativesnabla∇. The metric plays the role of the fundamental 
ﬁeld, which is deﬁned everywhere. In order to study how gravitation couples with 
other ﬁelds, we have to introduce the tetrads to deal with spinors in curved space– 
times. In addition, tetrads encode the Equivalence Principle since they are locally 
deﬁned, as gravitation is locally equivalent to an accelerated frame. Therefore, to 
obtain the effects of gravitation on general sources (particles or ﬁelds), we need to: 
left parenthesis i right parenthesis(i)write all the related equations in the Minkowski space–time in general coordinates, 
represented by trivial tetrads;left parenthesis i i right parenthesis(ii)replace the holonomic tetrads with the anholonomic 
tetrads, keeping the same formulae. The resulting equations hold in GR. Einstein’s 
vierbein theory becomes thus a gauge ﬁeld theory for gravity. 
Once we assign a general (anhonolomic) tetradStartSet e Subscript mu Superscript upper A Baseline EndSet

, we can rewrite the Riemann 
tensor according to the Cartan structure equations (see Sect. 14.4.1) as [  86]

14.5.2 
Gauge Formulation of Gravity: The Case of 
Teleparallel Gravity 
A gauge formulation of gravity is possible in the teleparallel gravity theory. We 
ﬁrst show that this general theory can be seen as a translation gauge theory (see 
Sect. 14.5.2), then we analyse the concepts of geodesics and autoparallel curves 
in this new framework (see Sect. 14.5.2). We ﬁnally concentrate on two important 
teleparallel subtheories: the metric teleparallel gravity, (in Sect. 14.5.2) and the sym-
metric teleparallel gravity, (see Sect. 14.5.2). Two important realizations of these 
approaches are the Teleparallel Equivalent General Relativity (TEGR) and the Sym-
metric Teleparallel Equivalent General Relativity (STEGR) respectively. 
Translation Gauge Theory 
In a modern vision of physics, it is very important to settle theories in a gauge 
framework [ 26]. In Sect. 14.5.1, we have seen that also GR can be converted in a 
gauge theory. Let us now sketch how GR can be formulated as a gauge theory of 
translations [ 9, 26]. 
This picture of GR can be achieved by both invoking the Nöther theorem and 
recalling that the source of the gravitational ﬁeld is given by the energy and momen-
tum. Indeed, provided that gravitational Lagrangian is invariant under space–time 
translations, the energy–momentum current is covariantly conserved. We will see 
that a metric teleparallel theory is more suitable to express gravity in this context, 
because it entails more beneﬁts, and the introduction of tetrads reveals to be more 
natural. 
This approach was ﬁrst proposed by Lasenby, Doran, and Gull in 1998 [131]. Its 
geometric setting is the tangent bundle, where the gauge transformations take place. 
Let us ﬁrst introduceStartSet x Superscript mu Baseline EndSet{xμ} andStartSet x Superscript upper A Baseline EndSet

as the coordinates onscript upper MM andupper T Subscript p Baseline script upper MTpM, respectively.

whereepsilon Superscript upper A Baseline left parenthesis x Superscript mu Baseline right parenthesisεA(xμ) are the inﬁnitesimal parameters of the transformation. The set of trans-

where the spurious term spoils the translational gauge covariance. However, in order 
to save this gauge covariance, we follow the praxis exploited in all other gauge 
theories [134]. Like in the electromagnetic case, where we include the gauge potential 
ﬁeld upper A Subscript muAμ to guarantee the covariance of the theory, also here we have to set forth the 
translational gauge potential 1-form upper B Subscript muBμ, assuming values in the Lie algebra of the 
translation group, to guarantee the covariance of the gravity theory. Therefore, we 
introduce the following gauge covariant derivative (see Sect. 14.4.1): 
e prime Subscript mu Baseline normal upper Psi identical to partial differential Subscript mu Baseline normal upper Psi equals partial differential Subscript mu Baseline plus upper B Subscript mu Superscript upper A Baseline partial differential Subscript upper A Baseline normal upper Psi commae,

(14.78) 
which holds in the class of Lorentz inertial frames (see Sect. 14.4.1). To recover the 
gauge covariance, we require that the gauge potential upper B Subscript muBμ transforms according to

It is important to stress that the local Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry 
respected by all physical laws in Nature, therefore, we must impose that our new the-

gravitational coupling prescription, which is a direct consequence of the strong 
Equivalence Principle [ 9, 129]. Indeed, this prescription is based on the General 
Covariance Principle, which can be seen as an active version of the strong Equiva-
lence Principle, namely given an equation valid in the presence of gravitation, the

where tauτ is the afﬁne parameter along gammaγ. The tangent vector ModifyingAbove gamma With dot˙γ to gammaγ, in the natural

coincide, whereas, in teleparallel gravity, they give rise to two different structures, 
because the autoparallels are related to the afﬁne connection, whereas the geodesic 
to the concept of metric, since it measures the minimal lengths between two or more 
points. In the teleparallel framework, Eq. (14.96) becomes (cf. Eq. (14.2))

Therefore, Eqs. (14.97) recover a new aspect of GR, seen not anymore geometrically 
as a minimal distance path, but in the gauge paradigm as a sort of Lorentz force-like 
interaction for the contortion tensor and kinetic energy-like interaction regarding the 
disformation tensor, acting on the test particle [ 18].

Another fundamental implication of autoparallels in teleparallel gravity is that they 
are sensitive to parameter changes, because it is possible to obtain another curve, 
although we do not alter the locus of its points. Therefore, if gamma left parenthesis lamda right parenthesisγ(λ) is autoparallel, 
then mu left parenthesis tau right parenthesis identical to gamma left parenthesis lamda left parenthesis tau right parenthesis right parenthesisμ(τ) ≡γ(λ(τ)) might be not autoparallel. This change of parameterization 
lamda equals lamda left parenthesis tau right parenthesisλ = λ(τ) entails that Eq. (14.96) becomes [162] 
StartFraction normal d squared x Superscript mu Baseline Over normal d tau squared EndFraction plus normal upper Gamma Subscript alpha beta Superscript mu Baseline StartFraction normal d x Superscript alpha Baseline Over normal d tau EndFraction StartFraction normal d x Superscript beta Baseline Over normal d tau EndFraction equals minus left parenthesis StartFraction normal d lamda Over normal d tau EndFraction right parenthesis squared StartFraction normal d squared tau Over normal d lamda squared EndFraction StartFraction normal d gamma Superscript mu Baseline Over normal d tau EndFraction periodd2xμ

Metric Teleparallel Gravity 
Metric (or torsional) teleparallel gravity (TG), known also as simply teleparallel 
gravity, is obtained by assuming the metric compatibility. The theory is geometrically 
described only by the torsion tensor. In Sect. 14.5.2, we have already seen that tetrads 
e Subscript mu Superscript upper AeA
μ and spin connection omega Subscript upper B mu Superscript upper Aω A
Bμ play a fundamental role in describing gravity. Indeed, 
GR can be recast as a translational gauge theory, where the related gravitational ﬁeld 
strength arises from the commutation relation of the covariant derivatives, see Eqs. 
(14.21) and (14.83), namely 2

The spin connection is linked to the inertial effects present in the tetrad frame, it is 
covariant under both diffeomorphisms and local Lorentz transformations (see Sect. 
14.4.2), assuring the same properties also for the torsion tensor. It is important to 
associate at each tetrad the related spin connection; therefore, in TG, we have always 
to provide the couple StartSet e Subscript mu Superscript upper A Baseline comma ModifyingAbove omega With bullet Subscript upper B mu Superscript upper A Baseline EndSet{eA

Bμ} [129]. There exist frames in TG where the related 
spin connection vanishes, which are called proper frames StartSet e Subscript mu Superscript upper A Baseline comma 0 EndSet{eA
μ, 0}. This deﬁnition 
leads to the Weitzenböck gauge, which produces the Weitzenböck connectionModifyingAbove normal upper Gamma With caret Subscript nu mu Superscript lamda Baseline equals e Subscript upper A Superscript lamda Baseline partial differential Subscript mu Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript upper A

A natural question spontaneously arises: given a tetrad frame, how do we oper-
atively associate the related spin connection? The simplest solution is tho choose 
proper frames, but, a priori, we do not know which are the related tetrads. Therefore, 
we have to ﬁnd a strategy to answer this question. As one can verify, determining 
them from the ﬁeld equations is, in general, not a simple task (see Ref. [129], for 
details). The method we propose relies on ﬁrst determining the inertial effects in the 
trivial tetrad frame and then associating the related spin connection (see Ref. [120], 
for another method). In this approach, let us ﬁrst introduce the concept of reference 
tetrad e Subscript left parenthesis normal r right parenthesis mu Superscript upper AeA
(r)¯, in which gravity is switched off, that it

(14.104) 
Through this process, we are basically exploiting the Equivalence Principle or the 
inverse translational coupling prescription (14.86). This has the effect to consider a 
trivial tetrad, where the anhonomaly coefﬁcients are zero (see Sect. (14.4.1)), and 
therefore the torsion tensor vanishes. In formulae, this can be written as (cf. Eq. 
(14.53))

which is quadratic in all the possible torsion tensor combinations. In particular, in the

thus to set at the same level internal and external indexes [129].

up to a boundary term, which gives no contributions, because at inﬁnity the space–

torsion is null. Eq.(14.114) is dynamically equivalent to that of GR (cf. Eq.(14.65)), 
namely upper S Subscript normal upper T normal upper E normal upper G normal upper R Baseline equals upper S Subscript normal upper G normal upper RSTEGR = SGR. This speciﬁc TG theory is called TEGR.

In Sect. 14.6, we will explicitly show that these ﬁeld equations coincide with those 
of GR. An important issue is related to the matter couplings, because the presence of 
torsion introduces some difﬁculties when dealing with fermions and bosons. Indeed, 
they are very sensitive to the appearance of distortions in the connections, and the 
unique resolution of this problem consists in resorting to the Weitzenböck gauge (see 
Refs. [ 9, 152], for more details). 
Looking at the torsion scalar expression (14.113), we see that it is possible to 
obtain new theories by considering the following general deﬁnition of torsion scalar: 
ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Subscript normal g normal e normal n Baseline colon equals minus StartFraction c 1 Over 4 EndFraction ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Subscript alpha mu nu Baseline ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Superscript alpha mu nu Baseline minus StartFraction c 2 Over 2 EndFraction ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Subscript alpha mu nu Baseline ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Superscript mu alpha nu Baseline plus c 3 ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Subscript alpha Baseline ModifyingAbove upper T With caret Superscript alpha Baseline comma

where c 1 comma c 2 comma c 3c1, c2, c3 are some free real constants, whose explicit values characterize the 
gravity model known under the name of three-parameter Hayashi–Shirafuji theory 
[114]. The general torsion scalar (14.121) is invariant under both general coordinates 
and local Lorentz transformations, independently of the numerical values of the 
coefﬁcients, because it relies only on the properties of the torsion tensor. On the 
contrary, the equivalence with GR, and then TEGR, is achieved only for c 1 equals c 2 equals c 3 equals 1c1 = c2 =
c3 = 1, which is naturally obtained within the TG gauge paradigm, without resorting 
to hypotheses related to GR [ 9, 129]. This crucial aspect makes TG a self-consistent 
theory. 
The Nöther energy–momentum pseudotensor script t Subscript mu Superscript rho ρ
μ entails partial differential Subscript mu Baseline script t Subscript mu Superscript rho Baseline equals 0∂μ ρ
μ = 0 [134]. In addi-
tion, considering the partial differential Subscript mu Baseline∂μ derivative of Eq.(14.117), we obtain partial differential Subscript mu Baseline upper T Superscript mu nu Baseline equals 0∂μT μν = 0, which 
shows that the energy–momentum tensor is conserved under ordinary derivative, 
which implies that the space–time chargesscript upper Q Superscript mu Baseline colon equals integral e normal d cubed x upper T Superscript 0 muQμ :=
{
ed3xT 0μ are conserved. In addi-
tion, being the TG ﬁeld equations symmetric, it is thus very easy to be compared with 
the GR ones [ 9, 129]. Therefore, the antisymmetric part of the energy–momentum 
tensor (14.67) is vanishing, namely

[μgν]ρ

(14.122) 
Another way to see this identity is through the invariance of the action under local 
Lorentz transformations [ 9, 129]. In TEGR, the covariance eliminates six of the 
sixteen equations, which means that we are able to determine the tetrads up to a local 
Lorentz transformation, which is equivalent to determine the metric tensor. 
The role of spin connection is not dynamical in TEGR and we will show that it 
trivially satisﬁes the ﬁeld equations. The same result is also conﬁrmed by exploiting 
the constrained variational principle via the Lagrange multipliers (see Ref. [129] and 
references therein, for details).

(14.126) 
This proves that the spin connection enters the Lagrangian as a total derivative, 
justifying also the possibility to reduce the calculations in TEGR by adopting the 
Weitzenböck gauge in any case. In addition, if we vary the Lagrangian in Eq. (14.126) 
with respect to the spin connection, we obtain an identically vanishing equation. 
Therefore, the spin connection does not contribute to the TG ﬁeld equations, rep-
resenting non-dynamical DoFs. This fact shows also that TEGR can be considered 
as a pure tetrad teleparallel gravity [136], which assumes that for whatever tetrad 
one chooses, the spin connection is zero, treating these two objects as independent 
structures (see Ref. [129], for details and for its implications). 
We have understood that the spin connection is not relevant, if we are interested in 
searching for the solutions of TEGR ﬁeld equations. However, formally, its presence 
fulﬁls a paramount role, because:left parenthesis i right parenthesis(i) it guarantees the covariance of the action under 
local Lorentz transformations and diffeomorphisms; left parenthesis i i right parenthesis(ii) it is endowed with a regu-
14.5 Equivalent Representations of Gravity: The Lagrangian Level

larizing power, because it removes the divergent inertial effects from the Lagrangian, 
dubbed thus renormalized action (see Ref. [129], for details);left parenthesis i i i right parenthesis(iii) it permits to obtain 
a regular ﬁeld theory and naturally produces, in its action, a Gibbons–Hawking–York 
term, which permits to be coherently related to the formulation of a quantum gravity 
theory (see Refs. [ 7, 8, 155], for details). 
Finally, analysing the DoFs of TEGR, we start from the vierbein e Subscript mu Superscript upper AeA
μ with 16 
components. We have to subtract 6 DoFs related to the inertial effects due to the spin 
connection and other 8 non-dynamical DoFs due to diffeomorphisms (the same as 
in GR). The result is 2 DoFs as in the case of GR. Also for this feature, TEGR is 
dynamically equivalent to GR. 
Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity 
Symmetric teleparallel gravity (STG) is a formulation of gravitational interaction 
described only in terms of non-metricity (14.4c). While TG theories have been exten-
sively discussed, STG patterns have only recently received a growing attention, and 
there are still some crucial points to be disclosed and better understood. This theory 
can be either formulated in terms of metric tensors or tetrads, although the former 
is the most common presentation followed in the literature [145]. In STG, the sym-
metric afﬁne connection (cf. Eq. (14.2)) assumes a fundamental dynamical role and 
represents an independent structure. This hypothesis is not trivial at all, because it 
requires considerable efforts in determining all the afﬁne components already in the 
simplest cases both at astrophysical and cosmological levels (see e.g. Refs. [ 54, 83, 
121], for more details). 
The presence of non-metricity entails particular geometric effects, which gives 
rise to counterintuitive implications from those analysed in the previous theories. 
They can be summarized in the following points: 
• raising up or lowering down indexes of vectors or tensors under the covariant 
derivative ModifyingAbove nabla With normal ♢
 ∇, is not straightforward like in metric case, namely given a vector v Superscript muvμ, 
we have 
g Subscript nu lamda ModifyingAbove nabla With normal ♢ Subscript mu Baseline v Superscript lamda Baseline equals ModifyingAbove nabla With normal ♢ Subscript mu Baseline v Subscript nu Baseline minus v Superscript lamda Baseline ModifyingAbove upper Q With normal ♢ Subscript mu nu lamda Baseline semicolongνλ

(14.127) 
• non-metricity does not preserve the length of vectors; indeed given two vectors

(14.128) 
where v dot w colon equals g Subscript mu nu Baseline v Superscript mu Baseline w Superscript nuv · w := gμνvμwν, which is not conserved, as well as the norm of a vector 
StartAbsoluteValue v EndAbsoluteValue colon equals StartRoot v dot v EndRoot|v| := √v · v, and therefore it is not possible to normalize it. It follows also that 
the angles, between two vectors, do not in general conserve, namely

STG is, in general, not a conformal theory, but it is possible to reduce it to a confor-
mal one (see Ref. [104], for details). The above results imply also the impossibility 
to deﬁne a proper time along a curve as in GR;

resorting to the Weyl conformal transformations (see Ref. [194], for details).

This connection can be set globally to zero, by considering the following afﬁne

β ∈O(1, 3) is an orthogonal matrix andxi 0 Superscript alphaξα
0 is a constant translational vector, 
which permits to havenormal upper Gamma Subscript mu nu Superscript alpha Baseline equals 0┌α
μν = 0, which is the so-called coincident gauge. Physically, 
this means that the origin of the tangent space (expressed by xi Superscript alphaξα) is coincident with 
the space–time origin (given by x Superscript muxμ). This gauge is deﬁned up to a linear afﬁne 
transformation a x Superscript mu plus baxμ + b with a comma ba, b real constant values. 
It is important to note that this residual global symmetry does not vanish at inﬁn-
ity, ensuing signiﬁcant properties at the infrared structure of the theory. In addition, 
recalling that the strong Equivalence Principle states that gravitation is indistinguish-
able from acceleration, its effects can be locally neglected via a diffeomorphic change 
of coordinates (i.e. LIFs). From this perspective, we understand that the afﬁne con-
nection is an integrable translation. Therefore, the coincident gauge embodies and 
saves the strong Equivalence Principle of GR [126]. 
It is worth noticing that the STEGR afﬁne connection is purely inertial and it does 
not contain any information about gravitation. Another important implication of the 
coincident gauge is the explicit breaking of diffeomorphism invariance due to the 
particular choice of coordinates, which does not occur in other frames [121]. The 
use or not of the coincident gauge affects only the boundary term (14.138), which 
has no inﬂuence on the ensuing dynamics and therefore neither on the evolution of 
the metric tensor. 
This particular gauge form permits to considerably simplify the calculations. In 
addition, the afﬁne ﬁeld equations (14.145) are trivially satisﬁed. In TG, the local 
Lorentz transformations are gauged through the spin connection and the calculations 
are simpliﬁed via the Weitzenböck choice, whereas, in STG, the diffeomorphism of 
coordinates become the new gauge and the calculations are easily carried out through 
the coincident gauge. This concept is summarized in the following scheme

(14.152) 
It is worth noticing that, in generic STG theories, it is not possible to require that 
the coincident gauge holds a priori. More speciﬁcally, it is not possible, in general, 
to use a coordinate system which simultaneously simpliﬁes metric and connection. 
When this can be achieved, it holds for a restricted set of geometries or it reduces 
the class of solutions (see Refs. [ 83], for further details). 
In STEGR, we have that the total DoFs are encoded in the metric tensor, having 
10 components from which we have to subtract 8 diffeomorphisms as in GR, having 
therefore again 2 DoFs as in GR. Here we have that the four diffeomorphisms of 
coordinates become the gauge diffeomorphism symmetries. While, in TEGR, metric 
and connection are related and, in STEGR, the connection becomes essentially a pure 
gauge and all the dynamics are enclosed in the metric, which is trivially connected. 
It is possible to introduce a close analogy between the ﬁelds xi Superscript alphaξα, parameterizing 
the connection, and the Stückelberg ﬁelds, related to the invariance of coordinates’ 
transformation, and also between the coincident gauge and the unitary gauge (see 
Ref. [165] for details). 
14.5.3 
A Discussion on Trinity Gravity at Lagrangian Level 
GR, TEGR, and STEGR constitute the so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity, but, 
from the above discussion, it is clear that they are nothing else but particular cases 
of wide classes of theories. According to their formulation, they are three non-
communicating theories, because they start from different hypotheses and different 
dynamical-geometric objects. GR is usually conceived as the geometric formulation 
of gravity, whereas TEGR and STEGR as the gauge approaches to gravity, albeit 
also GR can be formulated in a gauge way via the use of tetrads and spin connection. 
Covariance and (strong) Equivalence Principles are at the foundations of GR. The 
former postulate has a more general character, which can be easily recognized also 
in TEGR and STEGR, whereas the latter hides some subtleties, which are sources 
of confusion in literature. For example, some papers state that such a principle does 
not hold in TG. More properly, it is not strictly required at the foundation of TG but 
it must hold to provide mathematical and physical coherence for TEGR and STEGR
14.6 Field Equations in Trinity Gravity

theories. Basically, Equivalence Principle guarantees the equivalence among GR, 
TEGR, and STEGR. This last point can be summarized as follows:

As stated above, the equivalence does not for extensions like f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R), f left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis f (T ), and 
f left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis f (Q) because, in general, these extended theories differ for the DoFs (see [ 20] for  a  
straightforward example). However, equivalence can be restored also in extensions 
considering appropriate boundary terms. For example,f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R),f left parenthesis upper T comma upper B right parenthesis f (T, B), andf left parenthesis upper Q comma upper B right parenthesis f (Q, B)
can be compared as fourth-order theories when an appropriate boundary term upper BB is 
deﬁned in each gravity framework. In f left parenthesis upper T comma upper B right parenthesis f (T, B), this equivalence has been explicitly 
proved considering the boundary term as in Eq.(14.115) (see e.g. [  16, 17, 47]). An 
analogue procedure shows that also f left parenthesis upper Q comma upper B right parenthesis f (Q, B) theory can be dynamically reduced to 
f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R) deﬁning a suitable boundary term as in Eq.(14.138).

Field Equations in Trinity Gravity 
In the above discussion, equivalent representations of gravity have been compared at 
the level of actions and Lagrangians. Here we want to develop the same comparison 
at the level of ﬁeld equations. 
Let us start with the Bianchi identities, having the pivotal role to link the ﬁeld 
equations of a theory with the conservation laws of the gravity tensor invariants and

with the energy–momentum tensor [140]. We start from the second Bianchi identity

An important remark is in order at this point. As already discussed above in the 
case of Lagrangians, the equivalence holds only for the theories stemming out from 
the scalar invariants upper RR, upper TT , and upper QQ. In these speciﬁc cases, we obtain second-order 
equations. This is not true for extensions implying non-linear functions of these 
invariants. This fact points out again that GR, and its equivalent representations, are 
very peculiar cases among the theories of gravity. 
14.7 
Solutions in Trinity Gravity 
Clearly, the equivalence of GR, TEGR, and STEGR has to be proven also at the 
solution level. In Sect. 14.6, the same ﬁeld equations have been obtained, and then 
the same exact solutions, under the same symmetries and boundary conditions, have 
to be achieved.
14.7 Solutions in Trinity Gravity
513
In this perspective, performing the calculations to settle the solutions in the three 
gravity scenarios is useful also in view of extensions of the theories. Recently, it 
has been proposed a 3+1 splitting formalism in the geometric trinity of gravity [ 50] 
entailing the following advantages: (1) simplicity in carrying out numerical analyses; 
(2) solving some theoretical issues existing in the various formulations of GR at the 
fundamental level (e.g. canonical quantization); (3) broadening this methodology 
also in extended and alternative gravity frameworks. 
Here, we focus the attention on one of the simplest GR solutions, represented by 
the Schwarazschild space–time. Soon after the publication of GR theory by Einstein, 
Schwarzschild determined the solution, describing the space–time metric outside 
a spherically symmetric mass–energy distribution. This result is perfect agreement 
with the weak ﬁeld approximation [ 90]. 
Jebsen, in 1921, and Birkhoff, in 1923, independently proved that the 
Schwarzschild solution holds outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution, even 
if this varies over time. This is now known as the (Jebsen) Birkhoff theorem, and it 
can be stated as follows [ 25, 122]: any spherically symmetric solution of the GR 
ﬁeld equations in vacuum has to be static and asymptotically ﬂat. In addition, the 
Schwarzschild solution is the unique solution satisfying these hypotheses. 
This claim entails several signiﬁcant implications: (1) the uniqueness of the 
Schwarzschild solution in GR by imposing the spherical symmetry as starting hypoth-
esis; (2) no emission of gravitational waves, which can be interpreted, similarly as 
in electromagnetism, that there exists no monopole (spherically symmetric) radia-
tion; (3) the outcome of the Birkhoff theorem in GR gravity theory can be compared 
with the Gauss theorem implications in electromagnetism and in classical Newtonian 
gravity. 
Let us start our considerations taking into account a generic spherically symmet-
ric metric, whose line element, written in spherical coordinates StartSet t comma r comma theta comma phi EndSet{t,r, θ, ϕ}, in the  
equatorial plane theta equals pi divided by 2θ = π/2, and in geometric units (upper G equals c equals 1G = c = 1), reads as [140, 162] 
normal d s squared equals minus e Superscript nu left parenthesis t comma r right parenthesis Baseline normal d t squared plus e Superscript lamda left parenthesis t comma r right parenthesis Baseline normal d r squared plus r squared normal d phi squared commads2 = −eν(t,r)dt2 + eλ(t,r)dr2 + r2dϕ2,
(14.184) 
where nu left parenthesis t comma r right parenthesis comma lamda left parenthesis t comma r right parenthesisν(t,r), λ(t,r) are the two unknown functions to be determined. We supple-
ment this general metric with the well-known weak ﬁeld limit on the metric time

where upper MM is the compact object mass, being the origin of the gravitational ﬁeld, and

We want now to solve the ﬁeld equations in vacuum (upper T Subscript mu nu Baseline equals 0Tμν = 0, namely outside 
the gravitational source) in GR (Sect. 14.7.1), TEGR (Sect. 14.7.2), and STEGR 
(Sect. 14.7.3). We will observe how the Birkhoff theorem emerges also in TEGR 
and STEGR. Finally, we will recover the Schwarzschild metric in all three gravity 
theories, namely [140, 162]

Spherically Symmetric Solutions in TEGR 
For solving the TEGR ﬁeld equations, we adopt the tetrad formalism. We know that 
each tetrad ﬁeld must be associated to the related spin connection (see, for example, 
Ref. [129]). However, in TEGR, we can drastically simplify the calculations resorting 
to the Weitzenböck gauge. Therefore, we can choose the diagonal tetrad

Substituting the above expressions in Eq. (14.177b), we recover the same differential 
equations of GR (cf. Eq. (14.190)). Also, in this case, we obtain the Schwazrschild 
solution and the validity of the Birkhoff theorem. 
It is worth stressing that, also at this level, we cannot expect the same solutions 
for f left parenthesis upper R right parenthesis f (R), f left parenthesis upper T right parenthesis f (T ), and f left parenthesis upper Q right parenthesis f (Q) extensions.

Discussion and Perspectives 
We have gathered together basic concepts of Geometric Trinity of Gravity and derived 
the related dynamics pointing out analogies and differences between metric, afﬁne, 
and non-metric approaches. We tried to give a self-consistent picture of the three 
representations of gravitational ﬁeld. The main statement is that equivalence is strictly 
achieved for GR, TEGR, and STEGR and not for any extension of these theories. 
Firstly, we introduced the geometric arena of metric-afﬁne gravity, where metric 
tensor and afﬁne connection are two separate and independent structures. After, we 
provided the fundamental geometric objects, that is tetrads and spin connection. 
The former represents the observer laboratory, which solders the tangent space to the 
space–time manifold. This procedure gives rise to anholonomic frames. These frames 
become holonomic when we are dealing with inertial frames, where a particular role 
is fulﬁlled by trivial tetrads of Special Relativity (see Sect. 14.4.1). The latter are 
intimately related with general tetrads, because they represent the inertial effects and 
they are generated by local Lorentz transformations. They form the Lorentz group, 
which, in turn, can be proved to give rise to a Lorentz algebra. This is a crucial 
aspect for deﬁning the Fock–Ivanenko covariant derivative, useful to characterize 
the spin connection in terms of tetrads and to introduce the tetrad postulate (i.e. 
nabla Subscript mu Baseline e Subscript nu Superscript upper A Baseline equals 0∇μeA
ν = 0). This theoretical treatment can be interpreted from a physical point of 
view as discussed in Sect. 14.4.2. 
These mathematical tools allow to describe the Geometric Trinity of Gravity. 
Speciﬁcally, a metric formulation (encoded in the Riemannian geometry), and a 
gauge approach (encoded in teleparallel gravity) are possible. GR, TEGR, and 
STEGR are dynamically equivalent from the variation of their Lagrangians up to

a boundary term. Furthermore, starting from the second Bianchi identity, it is pos-
sible to infer the ﬁeld equations, which are identical in the three representations. 
Finally, we analysed spherically symmetric solutions in the three theories deriving 
the Schwarzschild space–time and the Birkhoff theorem also in TEGR and STEGR.

(14.202) 
However, as pointed out above, also if mathematical results are equivalent, the 
physical interpretation can be different depending on the considered variables and 
observables. This fact opens several questions. Some of them can be listed as follows: 
• Are there other equivalent formulations of gravity, outside of the Geometric Trin-
ity? In other words, we can ask for the existence of other representations of gravity 
equivalent to GR within the metric-afﬁne arena or, more in general, identifying 
other fundamental variables. The question implies also considering extended the-
ories of gravity which can be “reduced” to GR (see, for example, [ 61, 124] for  a  
discussion). 
• From an observational point of view, what does it mean that these three theories 
are dynamically equivalent? This issue translates in extracting observables from 
each gravity theory and then interpreting them, from a physical viewpoint, ﬁnding 
out suitable transformation laws which make equivalent the set of variables of each 
theory. 
• How can we construct observational apparatuses to test different theories dynam-
ically equivalent to GR? This point is a direct consequence of the previous one. 
The question can be posed also in another way: Is it possible, if any, to discrim-
inate different sets of observables for equivalent descriptions of gravity from an 
experimental point of view? 
• STG theories are the less analysed among the three approaches. A general tetrad 
formulation is necessary in view of physical implications. In particular, the inter-
pretation of gravity as a gauge theory could be particularly relevant to consider 
gravity under the same standard of other fundamental theories.
14.8 Discussion and Perspectives
519
• The Equivalence Principle (in its strong and weak formulations) is a fundamental 
aspect of GR [183]. It can be recovered in TEGR and STEGR also if it is not at 
the foundation of these theories. If it were violated at some level (e.g. at quantum 
level), would it be possible to state that TEGR and STEGR are more fundamental 
theories than GR because they do not require it as a basic principle? 
The above ones are some of the open issues related to equivalent representations 
of gravity and, in particular, to Gravity Trinity. Besides the mathematical aspects, it 
emerges that systematic experimental and observational protocols are necessary to 
establish the set of fundamental variables. For example, questions if metric or con-
nection are the “true” gravitational variables are still open. Non-metricity could have 
a main role in this discussion due to the fact that the stringent requirement of asking 
for Equivalence Principle could be relaxed. Forthcoming precision experiments [ 88], 
gravitational wave astronomy [ 5], and precision cosmology observations [ 45] could 
be the tools to answer these questions.
Chapter 15 
Conclusions 
This book is an “experiment” to demonstrate that, starting from simple arguments of 
Euclidean geometry, it is possible to arrive at the geometric formulation of physical 
theories: in the speciﬁc case, Special and General Relativity and, consequently, up to 
Relativistic Cosmology. Our attempt was aimed, above all, at undergraduate students, 
in particular those of our university courses, to demonstrate that, by a rigorous and 
extended mathematical development, theories deemed “difﬁcult”, such as General 
Relativity, can be understood and operationally used. We turned to students, and not 
to colleagues, to avoid falling into unnecessary technicalities that would have made 
the text unsuitable for a truly “basic” reading of Special and General Relativity. 
During the discussion, however, we introduced some advanced topics with the aim 
of stimulating the reader to further deepen and personal research. Our hope is not to 
have bored the reader but to have contributed something useful to the vast literature 
on the subject. Ours was a humble attempt, with no claim to completeness. We hope 
that our efforts have proved useful to someone eager to understand the wonderful 
book of Nature with the beautiful language of Mathematics which, as said by Leibniz, 
is “the honor of the human spirit”. 
We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars.
