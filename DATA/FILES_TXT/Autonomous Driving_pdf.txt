Foreword
Society and Mobility
As by clear evidence: We are on the brink of the next mobile revolution. Autonomous
vehicles will become an element of road trafﬁc. The data needed is provided by cameras
and sensors, and processed in real time by a computer in fractions of a second. These
vehicles permanently exchange information with one another and with the transport
infrastructure. Driving robots are to successively relieve the driver of individual tasks.
Nonetheless, the technological perspective of autonomous driving is only one aspect of
many. Autonomous vehicles will also have a direct impact on our society that today we
can barely imagine. Numerous critical questions arise: What are the prospects concerning
data security? How shall we deal with wide-ranging interventions in our own mobile
autonomy? What problems result when an autonomous vehicle crosses national borders?
In what form will insurance companies assume liability for autonomous vehicles involved
in accidents in the future? Or, vice versa: Can we continue to leave humans at the wheel at
all, and may driving robots prove to increase road safety?
The Daimler and Benz Foundation considers the social dimension of these changes to
be of at least as great signiﬁcance as the technological one. Innovative technologies are by
themselves insufﬁcient to shape these developments and to realize automated driving in
our society. We are therefore well advised to already start asking ourselves such questions
today and not simply accept this profound change in our mobility as given, allowing it to
“overrun” us. To shed light on the ethical, social, legal, psychological, or transport-related
aspects of this process, the Daimler and Benz Foundation invited researchers from various
specialist ﬁelds to address this topic.
The project’s core team—Markus Maurer, Barbara Lenz, Hermann Winner, and
J. Christian Gerdes—identiﬁed the most pertinent questions from their point of view. At
the same time, the four researchers established an international network of renowned
specialists, who agreed to share their views and experience. The result before us now, a
v
“white paper”, analyzes the developments that can already be seen from an interdisci-
plinary perspective. It is the preliminary result of a large-scale funded project: Under the
name “Autonomous Driving—Villa Ladenburg”, it was given a time frame of around two
years and a budget of 1.5 million euros by the Daimler and Benz Foundation. Our
declared aim with the present ﬁndings is to make available an objective and independent
source of information.
To our minds, exploring the topic from an interdisciplinary perspective is indispens-
able. In the present volume, the authors therefore attempt an initial comprehensive account
of what we may judge as scientiﬁcally assertable at this moment in time. At the same time,
we must enable potential users of, and others affected by, the still difﬁcult-to-grasp new
technologies to experience them ﬁrsthand. In this way, many people can begin to have an
idea of what they can expect and what the technology can actually do—and also what it
will not be able to do.
It is already becoming clear that three aspects come to the fore. Firstly, ethical ques-
tions will override all others. Only when autonomously acting vehicles have successfully
been provided with a kind of ethics in decision making will driving robotics be able to
assert itself in practice. This is especially true of so-called dilemma situations, in which it
has to be weighed up, in the case of an unavoidable collision, what behavior will cause the
least amount of harm to the persons involved both inside and outside the vehicle. A further
key question to clear up is what legislative consequences could result here (e.g., trafﬁc
regulations).
A further matter concerns the performance of machine perception. This comes up
against various limits: Sensors, cameras, or assembled components degenerate and suffer
in their reliability over time. Although it is possible to estimate state uncertainties, and
from this to check machine-perception performance, will failures really be predictable?
And how could an autonomous machine’s safe state be at all deﬁned under all conceivable
circumstances? This issue can be summed up even more clearly in one keyword: robo-
tiﬁcation. Ultimately, the speciﬁc questions addressed here without exception penetrate in
deeper forms into all areas of everyday life where autonomous machine systems are used.
Conditions here also need analyzing, and consequences must be anticipated.
Not least, automated driving can open up completely new opportunities, but also bring
with it negative aftereffects. A reduction or shifting of parking-space requirements in inner
cities and an efﬁcient use of road space in ﬂowing trafﬁc would be set against fresh
suburbanization stemming from alleviated conditions on the urban fringe.
As beﬁts our Foundation’s purpose, this publication is designed to contribute to the
anticipation and excitement of future discourse, and in this way is aimed at beneﬁtting
society as a whole. The book will place a scientiﬁc basis in the hands of representatives

Introduction
Markus Maurer
Autonomous driving is a popular subject of discussion in today’s media and, occasionally,
a highly emotional one. Proclamations of success from car makers, system partners, and
companies whose business models stem from other ﬁelds continue to fuel the debate. As
late as 2011, as the “Autonomous Driving—Villa Ladenburg” project (which enabled the
present volume to be published) was still being deﬁned, we could not foresee how central
the topic would be in public discourse at the project’s end three years later.
In line with the objectives of the Daimler and Benz Foundation, the project aims to
stimulate discussion on a technical topic of great social signiﬁcance. It would be immodest
and objectively false to credit growing discussion to this project when, at the same time,
several leading global ﬁrms are using their research and public relations teams to position
themselves in this forward-looking technological ﬁeld. Nonetheless, the project inﬂuenced
the public discourse decisively at various points, even if the connection was not imme-
diately recognizable.
Indisputably, the Daimler and Benz Foundation has shown excellent and timely
instincts in launching this project. Precisely because autonomous driving is currently
receiving so much attention, the present volume’s publishers deem it a good time to
present as complete an overview of the topic as possible. For this discussion, researchers
from various disciplines have taken up the task of sharing their viewpoints on autonomous
driving with the interested public. This has brought many relevant issues into the debate.
As researchers, this has taken us into unfamiliar territory. We are addressing a spe-
cialist audience, potential stakeholders and the interested public in equal measure. Of
course, this book cannot satisfy every desire. For further reading, then, please consult the
prior articles of the project team in the journals and conference proceedings of their

respective specialist ﬁelds. The Foundation also plans publications to accompany this
volume that will summarize this book’s key ﬁndings and put them in everyday language.
1.1
What Is Autonomous Driving?
Even a quick glance at the current public debate on autonomous driving shows that there
is no universal consensus on terminology. In order to bring about a certain convergence in
how the terms of autonomous driving are understood among those involved in the project,
some deﬁnitions were selected in a highly subjective fashion at the beginning of this
project. These deﬁnitions were illustrated with use cases described in-depth (see Chap. 2).
These deﬁnitions are described in all of their subjectivity here.
For decades, word plays on the word “automobile” have been rife among pioneers in
the ﬁeld of autonomous driving [1]. When the car was invented, the formulation of
“automobile,” combining the Greek autòs (“self, personal, independent”) and the Latin
mobilis (“mobile”) [2] stressed the “self-mobile.” The overriding emotion was joy that the
driver was mobile without the aid of horses. What this term failed to acknowledge,
however, was that the lack of horses meant that the vehicle had also lost a certain form of
autonomy [1]. Through training and dressage, carriage horses had learned for themselves
(self = Greek autos, see above) to stay within the bounds of simple laws (Greek nómos:
“human order, laws made by people”). In this sense, horse and carriage had thus both
achieved a certain autonomy.
In the transition from horse carriages to automobiles, important obstacle-avoidance
skills were lost, as undoubtedly was the occasional ability to undertake “autonomous
missions.” Many a time would horses have brought a carriage home safely even if the
driver was no longer completely ﬁt for the journey. They would have at least have
conveyed the vehicle in a “safe state,” eating their ﬁll of grass on the wayside. The
autonomous automobile aims to recover its lost autonomy and indeed go far beyond its
historic form.
A special perception of Kant’s concept of autonomy, as formulated by Feil, came to be
of importance in understanding “autonomous driving” within the project: autonomy as
“self-determination within a superordinate (moral) law” [3]. In the case of autonomous
vehicles, man lays down the moral law by programming the vehicle’s behavior. The
vehicle must continually make decisions about how to behave in trafﬁc in a manner
consistent with the rules and constraints with which it was programmed.
It has to be said that the reaction of experts from diverse disciplines ranged and ranges
from complete rejection of this deﬁnition to carefully considered approval. Independent of
this, however, it is possible, by reference to the concept of autonomy interpreted and
understood in these Kantian terms, to point out the direct linkage between technological
development and ethical considerations.
2
M. Maurer
The importance of this deﬁnition for engineers comes through clearly in my discus-
sions with students. Confronted with this deﬁnition, engineering students in Braunschweig
and Munich have in the last ten years come to understand that the development of
autonomous driving requires them to not only research and develop technology but also to
implement “moral laws” with utmost consistency. How does an autonomous vehicle
behave in a dilemma situation, when at least one road user will inevitably be injured in an
accident? This discussion is explored in greater depth in this book by Patrick Lin and
Chris Gerdes (see Chaps. 4 and 5).
To bring engineers and lawyers into agreement, various degrees of assistance and
automation were deﬁned in a working group drawn from the German Federal Highway
Research Institute (BASt) [4]. The highest deﬁned degree of automation was named “Full
Automation”: The fully automated vehicle drives by itself without human supervision.
Should system performance degrade, the vehicle is autonomously “restored to the system
state of minimal risk.” From a technical point of view, the greatest challenge lies in the
complete absence of a human supervisor who knows the system limits, recognizes system
faults and, where needed, switches the vehicle into a safe state. Fully automated vehicles
must monitor their own state autonomously, spot potential system faults and performance
degradations, and then—with a threatened drop in performance—initialize and execute
the transition to a safe state. Clearly, the safe state takes on a central role in the deﬁnition.
What does a safe state consist of, however, when a fully automated vehicle is moving on
the highway at 65 miles per hour (or even faster in Germany)?
Ohl [7] pointedly concluded that the prototypes for autonomous vehicles demonstrated
on public roads by research institutes, vehicle manufacturers, and IT companies in recent
decades have only been partially automated in terms of the BASt deﬁnition. Safety drivers
have supervised the automated vehicles; a production-ready safety concept for fully
automated vehicles has yet to materialize. While there have been successful trips in which
the safety driver has not had to intervene, to this day we lack evidence of the feasibility of
journeys on public roads with fully automated vehicles.
Despite the concerns of some experts mentioned above, autonomous vehicles in the
present volume are characterized by their “self-determination within a superordinate
(moral) law” laid down by humans (Kant, as found in [3], see above). They are fully
automated vehicles in terms of the BASt deﬁnitions [4].
For reasons of space, it has been decided for this book to forego a narrative history and
a documentation of the state of research and the technology. Regarding autonomous road
vehicles, Matthaei et al. [5] have summarized the current state of the art. In Chap. 3,
Fabian Kröger gives an arresting historical overview of autonomous driving as a visionary
concept, or as science ﬁction, chieﬂy within image-based media.

Introduction

1.2
Autonomous Driving—Drivers Behind the Research
Research into fully automated vehicles [4] used to be, and still is, driven by a host of
reasons. Only the most common are given in this section.
Even though the number of accident deaths in Germany drops nearly annually, the
estimated worldwide number is occasion enough for a further increase in transport-system
safety. According to the WHO, 1.24 million people worldwide died in road accidents in
2010 [8]. In Chap. 17, Thomas Winkle examines the conditions under which the
accident-prevention impact of automated vehicles can be forecast prior to their being
launched on the market.
How much a driver or potential user requires assistance is at the heart of any particular
vehicle system. Is he or she confronted with an activity that is tiring and kills off any
pleasure in driving (stop-and-go trafﬁc, long stretches on highways)? Or is he or she
temporarily unﬁt to drive, for instance under the inﬂuence of medication, too tired or
simply too inattentive for active driving? Is there a need for assistance because of
diminished faculties due to illness or old age, or diseased muscles or bones? In these
cases, a car’s autonomous capability to drive opens up new opportunities for individual
mobility.
Fully automated driving [4] offers the greatest potential for optimizing trafﬁc ﬂow. By
far the most well-known European program of vehicle automation of the last century has
already indicated this objective: “Programme for a European trafﬁc with highest efﬁ-
ciency and unprecedented safety” (1987–1994), or “Prometheus” for short [6]. More
recent projects have demonstrated technical solutions specially designed to increase trafﬁc
ﬂow. In Chaps. 15, 16, and 19, the authors occupy themselves with autonomous vehicles’
potential for improved trafﬁc ﬂow and new vehicle usage concepts.
The signiﬁcance of the capability to drive autonomously for commercial vehicles
merits special attention. Heike Flämig examines what potentialities arise for autonomous
vehicles in the area of freight transport (see Chap. 18).
The potential that autonomous vehicles’ rollout holds for a far-reaching reshaping of
the transport system—indeed the city itself—has not yet been heavily researched. The
authors of this book’s “Mobility” and “Acceptance” sections illustrate how multilayered
the changes made possible by introducing autonomous vehicles could be. These potential
changes can drive, but also inhibit, such an introduction.
1.3
The Layout of this Book
Immediately following this introduction, the use cases which contributed to the authors’
common understanding of autonomous driving, and which should do the same for readers
(see above), are elucidated. This is followed by six sections, each overseen by editors with
specialist knowledge, from whose pens also stem the short introductions preceding each
section.

M. Maurer
Fabian Kröger opens the ﬁrst section on the topic of “Human and Machine” with a
summary of how autonomous road vehicles have been viewed in public, mostly in the
media, since work started on vehicle automation almost one hundred years ago. Chris
Gerdes and Patrick Lin address how autonomous driving is to be assessed under ethical
considerations, and whether autonomous vehicles can behave ethically. Berthold Färber
and Ingo Wolf discuss questions of human and machine coexistence.
The “Mobility” section examines how mobility may be altered by the introduction of
autonomous vehicles, both generally and in speciﬁc aspects. To this end, Miranda
Schreurs and Sibyl Steuwer give an overview of the political framework. Barbara Lenz
and Eva Fraedrich examine the potential for new mobility concepts that may result from
autonomous driving. Sven Beiker outlines various deployment scenarios for fully auto-
mated vehicles [4]; he also discusses an actual case of them in use. Dirk Heinrichs looks at
the ramiﬁcations and questions for urban development that may arise from autonomous
driving. Hermann Winner and Walther Wachenfeld take up the question of what impact
autonomous driving may have on the vehicle concept itself. Rita Cyganski looks into the
issue of how autonomous vehicles may change demand for mobility and how this can be
represented in models for transport planning.
In the “Trafﬁc” section, Peter Wagner and Bernhard Friedrich forecast how autono-
mous vehicles may affect trafﬁc. Thomas Winkle furthers the discussion on the potential
safety beneﬁts of assisted, partially, and fully automated vehicles [4]. Heike Flämig
examines their particular signiﬁcance for freight transport. Marco Pavone discusses the
potential of “Mobility on Demand.”
The “Safety” section tackles basic questions of technical reliability in machine per-
ception (Klaus Dietmayer), functional safety (Andreas Reschka, Walther Wachenfeld,
Hermann Winner), and data integrity (Kai Rannenberg).
In the “Legal and Liability” section, Tom Gasser, Stephen Wu and Bryant Walker
Smith examine the current legal systems and legal frameworks for autonomous driving in
both Germany and the USA; Thomas Winkle recommends drawing from the experience
of liability cases in the development process.
In the “Acceptance” section, Eva Fraedrich and Barbara Lenz explore questions of
individual and societal acceptance of automated vehicles. Armin Grunwald investigates
questions of society’s perception of risk in connection with autonomous driving. Eva
Fraedrich and Barbara Lenz examine the relationship between today’s car-usage practices
and attitudes to autonomous driving. David Woisetschläger discusses the economic
consequences for the traditional car industry and new market players.

Work in the Project
The working methods in the “Autonomous Driving—Villa Ladenburg” project have
inﬂuenced the present book. They are thus brieﬂy sketched out below for the sake of
transparency. The “motor” of the project was the core team consisting of Chris Gerdes,

Barbara Lenz, Hermann Winner, and Markus Maurer. This was supported by the research
work of Eva Fraedrich, Walter Wachenfeld, and Thomas Winkle, who receive our grateful
thanks at this point. In the ﬁrst of the project’s two years—the project ran from October
2012 to September 2014 in total—over 200 questions relevant to autonomous driving
were identiﬁed among the core team. These questions were the basis for project speciﬁ-
cation sheets that served as guidelines for this volume’s authors. Three workshops were
carried out to bring about a common understanding of autonomous driving among the
participants in the project and share different perspectives from their various specialist
disciplines. At one of the ﬁrst workshops, in November 2013 in the Möhringen district of
Stuttgart, the concept of the project and basic understanding of autonomous driving—
established via the deﬁnitions discussed above and the use cases (see Chap. 2)—were
introduced and explored.
At two further workshops in Monterey (February 2014) and Walting (March 2014), the
authors presented and put forward for discussion their answers to the project speciﬁcation
sheets. It is thanks to the discipline, openness, and expertise of the authors that a com-
prehensive discussion on autonomous driving can be presented in this volume, addressing
in equal measure the potential and the challenges to society on the path to mass pro-
duction. In this sense, this book hopes to be a starting point for sustainable research and
development of autonomous road vehicles. Special thanks are due to all the authors, who
have involved themselves in this book project with focus, discipline and a willingness for
interdisciplinary dialogue.
In the closing phase of this book’s production, the authors were overseen by the editors
of the individual sections, who took great pains to aid the convergence of the articles
therein. Editing the sections was among the tasks of the core-team members. Special
thanks go to Tom Gasser and Bernhard Friedrich, who each took on the editing of a
section and brought necessary expertise that was not available on the core team. Even
before it had drawn to a close, the project made a considerable impact on the specialist
discussion on autonomous driving in Germany and the USA. One particularly positive
outcome was that many participants in the project have taken part in round table dis-
cussions on “automated driving” at the initiative of the German Federal Ministry for
Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) and its working groups since December
2013. Project ﬁndings thus ﬂowed, and continue to ﬂow, into the reports of the round
table. The interest of experts and the public became clear in the response to the numerous
talks, press interviews, and publications carried out in the context of the project. Over the
duration of the project, considerable adjustments were made in the communications of
leading vehicle manufacturers and tech companies relating to autonomous driving. It
cannot be ruled out that the project has already left its ﬁrst relevant marks here.
Even though the project itself employed a scientiﬁcally clear-cut deﬁnition of auton-
omous driving, some of its ﬁndings will be of direct practical relevance for highly
automated vehicles and even driver assistance systems already in use in today’s pro-
duction road cars.

2.1
Motivation for the Consideration of Use Cases
Although autonomous driving is characterized (see Chap. 1) by the deﬁnition for “fully
automated” according to BASt [1] as well as the quote by Feil [2] “self-determination
within the scope of an higher (moral) law”, it is possible to come up with a large variety of
usage scenarios and speciﬁcations for autonomous driving. In order to grasp this variety,
proxies are sought, which on the one hand make use of distinguishing characteristics, and
on the other hand describe typical usage scenarios for autonomous driving. In the fol-
lowing, these will be called use cases for autonomous driving. Besides the nomenclature,
the use cases are deﬁned by their distinguishing characteristics, so that a common
understanding can be reached for all writing and reading these book chapters. In addition,
the use cases are supposed to serve as reference scenarios for further discussion. It is not
intended to exclude other examples. However it is recommended to use the deﬁned use
cases to avoid misunderstanding or oversight. The following deﬁnitions and assumptions
can additionally be expanded for the different book chapters with detailed descriptions. As
for the different book chapters, deﬁnitions and assumptions are relevant in different ways.
For instance the owner relations are less important for a technical point of view than for
taking a look at the market impact. Thus, deﬁnitions and assumptions are to be examined
critically. Desired results from working with these use cases are a founded change of
deﬁnitions and assumptions as well as possible controversy, which arise in between the
different topics (different parameter sensitivity).
The following description of the use cases is structured in 4 sections. Section 2.2,
general assumptions, describes the limitations and assumptions that are used and are
supposed to apply for all use cases. Section 2.3 introduces the four selected use cases and
deﬁnes the speciﬁc characteristics. Section 2.4 explains the selection and the level of
detail for the characteristics describing the use cases. Section 2.5, general deﬁnitions,
proposes deﬁnitions, which facilitate a unique description of the use cases.
2.2
General Assumptions
Besides the characteristics which distinguish the use cases, and which are listed in the
following section, there are additional attributes, which apply to the chosen use cases as
well. The following general assumptions describe these attributes.
Mixed operation: One basic assumption is that the use cases are deployed at the
considered time in a mixed operation of transportation systems with different levels of
automation. Road trafﬁc consists of vehicles with all levels of automation ranging from
“driver-only” to “assisted” to “fully automated”. During the stepwise introduction of
automation, both human vehicle operation and driving robot operation are equally likely.
10
W. Wachenfeld et al.
Failures: Hardware or software failures can also happen with autonomously driven
vehicles. However, it is assumed that a vehicle designed according to the state of the art
(e.g. ISO 26262) is, with regard to the failures mentioned, at least as reliable and safe as
today’s vehicles.
Level of detail: The description of the use cases is not a detailed speciﬁcation. Instead
of a detailed description of weather conditions, light conditions, road surface conditions
etc. the following simpliﬁcation is assumed. The quality as well as the success rate with
which the driving robot performs the driving task is similar to the human quality and
success rate. For example, heavy rain leads only to transition to the safe state and dis-
continuation of the transportation task when a driver would discontinue the journey as
well. This document does not tackle the question of whether this assumption from the
user’s point of view, the society’s point of view etc. is sufﬁcient. Furthermore, in this
document the question of how this quality and success rate is quantiﬁed and proved
remains unanswered.
Conformity with regulations: For all use cases it is assumed that the autonomous
journey is performed compliant with the set of rules of the respective jurisdiction
(federal/national level, state level in the United States), in which the driving actually takes
place. The question about the action in dilemma situations directly arises from this
assumption. Is the driving robot permitted, or is it even possible, to disregard rules in
order to prevent major damage? For these use cases it is assumed that a legally valid set of
rules, respectively meta-rules, exists, which the driving robot follows. In order to do so,
the respective authority has granted permission to perform autonomous driving, while it is
not further contemplated how such permission can be obtained and what the respective
rules might be.
2.3
Description of the Use Cases
The motivations and general assumptions underlying the use cases are laid out above, and
the characteristics considered for their description are explained in Sect. 2.4. The com-
bination of these characteristics and/or their values leads to a very large number of use
cases, which cannot be described in detail. The four use cases described in the following
serve, as mentioned above, as proxies for this multitude of possible use cases. Other use
cases are not disregarded but our focus is set on the following four:
• Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability.
• Autonomous Valet Parking.
• Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability.
• Vehicle on Demand.

Use Cases for Autonomous Driving
11
The partition of the driving task between human and driving robot, in which the four
versions differ, has particularly contributed to the selection of the use cases. The ﬁrst two
use cases are seen as introductory versions, while the two latter use cases present widely
developed versions of autonomous driving.
2.3.1
Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability
An exemplary use case of the interstate pilot is depicted in Fig. 2.1.
2.3.1.1 Benefit
The driving robot takes over the driving task of the driver exclusively on interstates or
interstate-like expressways. The driver becomes just a passenger during the autonomous
journey, can take his/her hands off of the steering wheel and pedals, and can pursue other
activities.
2.3.1.2 Description
As soon as the driver has entered the interstate, he/she can, if desired, activate the driving
robot. This takes place most logically in conjunction with indicating the desired desti-
nation. The driving robot takes over navigation, guidance, and control until the exit from
or end of the interstate is reached. The driving robot safely coordinates the handover to the
driver. If the driver does not meet the requirements for safe handover, e.g. because he/she
is asleep or appears to have no situation awareness, the driving robot transfers the vehicle
to the risk-minimal state on the emergency lane or shortly after exiting the interstate.
During the autonomous journey, no situation awareness is required from the occupant; the
deﬁnition for fully automated driving according to BASt [1] applies. Because of simple
scenery and limited dynamic objects, this use case is considered as an introductory

scenario, even if the comparatively high vehicle velocity exacerbates accomplishing the
risk-minimal state considerably.
2.3.1.3 Values of Characteristics
Table 2.1 summarizes the characteristics for the interstate pilot use case. Figure 2.2 shows
the intervention possibilities for instances on the levels of the driving task for the use case
Interstate Pilot. “The entities which can intervene into the driving task are depicted on the

right side of the hierarchy and are sorted from dominant at the top to recessive at the
bottom.” The vehicle user is the only entity which may intervene. It should be emphasized
again that the handover is managed in a safe manner through the driving robot. Potential
service providers, police and ambulance with speciﬁc authority, a trafﬁc coordinator etc.
do not have any possibility to intervene with the vehicle control.
2.3.2
Autonomous Valet Parking
An exemplary use case of the autonomous valet parking is depicted in Fig. 2.3.
2.3.2.1 Benefit
The driving robot parks the vehicle at a remote location after the passengers have exited
and cargo has been unloaded. The driving robot drives the vehicle from the parking
location to a desired destination. The driving robot re-parks the vehicle.
The driver saves the time of ﬁnding a parking spot as well as of walking to/from a
remote parking spot. In addition, access to the vehicle is eased (spatially and temporally).
Additional parking space is used more efﬁciently and search for parking is arranged more
efﬁciently.
Fig. 2.3 Autonomous valet parking
14
W. Wachenfeld et al.
2.3.2.2 Description
If a driver has reached his/her destination (for example place of work, gym, or home), he/she
stops the vehicle, exits, and orders the driving robot to park the vehicle. The vehicle can be
privately owned, but might also be owned by a carsharing provider or similar business model.
Therefore, the driving robot may now drive the vehicle to a private, public, or service-provider-
owned parking lot. It is important to assign a parking lot to the driving robot. The search for the
respective parking lot by the driving robot is not taken into consideration for this use case.
Therefore a deﬁned destination for the driving robot is always given. Because of the low
velocity and the light trafﬁc situation, the deployment of Autonomous Valet Parking is limited
to the immediate vicinity of the location where the driver left the vehicle. On the one hand, this
limitation reduces the requirements regarding the (driving-) capabilities of the driving robot
signiﬁcantly, because lower kinetic energy as well as shorter stopping distances results from
lower velocity. On the other hand, this use case could potentially irritate or frustrate other road
users. However, this use case seems to be suitable as an introductory scenario.
An authorized user in the vicinity of the vehicle can indicate a pick-up location to the
driving robot. The driving robot drives the vehicle to the target destination and stops, so
that the driver can enter and take over the driving task.
If desired by the parking lot administration, the driving robot can re-park the vehicle.
2.3.2.3 Values of Characteristics
Table 2.2 summarizes the characteristics for the autonomous valet parking use case. The
entities which can intervene into the driving task are depicted on the right side of the
hierarchy and are sorted from dominant at the top to recessive at the bottom (see Fig. 2.4).
The vehicle user can change the driving mission from outside of the vehicle and instruct the
driving robot to perform a safe exit. The service provider overrules the vehicle user and can

also inﬂuence the driving mission and the safe exit. Both entities are overruled by the
entities with exclusive rights. For example, the police or ambulance can decelerate the
vehicle on the guidance level, change navigation and driving mission, and order a safe exit.
2.3.3
Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability
An exemplary use case of the full automation using driver for extended availability is
depicted in Fig. 2.5.
2.3.3.1 Benefit
If the driver desires to do so, he/she hands over the driving task to the driving robot in
permitted areas. The driver becomes just a passenger during the autonomous journey, can
take his/her hands off of the steering wheel and pedals, and can pursue other activities.
2.3.3.2 Description
If the driver desires, he/she can always hand over the driving task to the driving robot,
whenever the current scenery is cleared to do so. Almost the entire trafﬁc area in the
permitted country is approved for the vehicle; however, such approval is subject to
restrictions. If, for instance, the trafﬁc ﬂow is rerouted, a new parking structure opens, or
similar changes are undertaken to the infrastructure, then the respective areas cannot be
navigated autonomously until further approval. It also appears to be reasonable in this
scenario that road sections are excluded from approval permanently or temporarily, e.g.
roads with a high frequency of pedestrians crossing. Here again, the handover between
driver and driving robot has to be managed in a safe manner.
This use case might come as close as it gets to today’s visions for autonomous driving,
as it corresponds strongly with today’s passenger vehicle usage, and the driving task is

almost completely delegated to the driving robot while the traditional main user and driver
still participate in the journey.
2.3.3.3 Values of Characteristics
Table 2.3 summarizes the characteristics for the full automation using driver for extended
availability use case. Figure 2.6 shows, which entity (right) intervenes with a certain
driving task (left) on a certain level. If desired, the vehicle user can drive the vehicle the

same way as driving a classic driver only automobile, provided that the driving task has
been handed over safely from the driving robot. Furthermore, the vehicle user can intervene
on the level of the navigation, guidance and control tasks. The vehicle user dominates the
entities with exclusive rights. The vehicle user can therefore overrule police or ambulance,
which can exclusively intervene on the guidance level. The same is true for the service
provider. The service provider can intervene on the navigation and guidance level, as long
as not overruled by the vehicle user. It is left open in this document for which services the
service provider needs access. Some concepts propose services where the service provider
takes over the navigation for commercial use and partly pays for fuel and travel expenses.
2.3.4
Vehicle on Demand
An exemplary use case of the vehicle on demand is depicted in Fig. 2.7.
2.3.4.1 Benefit
The driving robot drives the vehicle autonomously in all scenarios with occupants, with
cargo, but also completely without any payload. The driving robot makes the vehicle
available at any requested location. Passengers use the travel time completely indepen-
dently for other activities than performing the driving task. The cabin is designed com-
pletely independently from any restrictions of a driver workplace whatsoever. Cargo can
be transported with the aid of the driving robot continuously for 24 h a day, as long as it is
not restricted by the energy supply for driving.
Fig. 2.6 Full automation using driver for extended availability options for intervention
18
W. Wachenfeld et al.
2.3.4.2 Description
The driving robot receives the requested destination from occupants or external entities
(users, service provider, etc.), to which the vehicle proceeds autonomously. Humans do
not have any option to take over the driving task. The human can only indicate the
destination or activate the safe exit, so that he/she can exit the vehicle safely as quickly as
possible. With this driving robot, a wealth of different business models is conceivable.
A mix of taxi service and car sharing, autonomous cargo vehicles or even usage models
that goes beyond the pure transportation task. One example could be a vehicle for social
networks that uses information from the network directly in order to plan routes, match
people or enables further services which have not yet been thought of.
2.3.4.3 Values of Characteristics
Table 2.4 summarizes the characteristics for the vehicle on demand use case. The pos-
sibilities for intervention regarding the use case vehicle on demand are especially broad
(see Fig. 2.8), due to the enormous (driving) abilities of the driving robot. The driving
robot always carries out the control level. An entity with exclusive rights (e.g. police or
ambulance) and the entity for trafﬁc management can both intervene on navigation and
guidance levels. Vehicle users and service providers can inﬂuence the safe exit and
therefore instruct the driving robot to a fast and safe stop in order for a passenger to leave
the vehicle. It is especially noticeable that service providers and the authority with
exclusive rights can overrule the vehicle user. If one authority overrules the user, he/she
cannot perform the safe exit anymore and has to stay in the vehicle. This constellation is

similar to that of current taxi concepts. The taxi driver can stop as fast as possible, if the
passenger so requests. Generally though, he (the taxi driver) also has the possibility to
disregard this request and drive the vehicle as he/she own desires.
2.4
Selected Characteristics to Describe the Use Cases
In this section, the characteristics describing the use cases and their values are explained in
more detail. Besides the following few technical characteristics of autonomous driving, it
is possible to deﬁne further distinguishing attributes, for example regarding the business
model or market position. This will be disregarded for now because of the as-yet little
knowledge in this area.

the
three-level-model for the driving task according to Donges [3] and chosen for the
description. In that model, the driving task is divided into the three levels navigation,
guidance, and control.
2.4.1
Characteristic A: Type of Occupant
2.4.1.1 Motivation
For today’s individual mobility with a vehicle, a human is required to be permanently in
the vehicle and to control it under all circumstances [4]. This constraint could change with
the automation of the driving task. Thus the vehicle concept and the safety concept depend
on the type of occupant.
2.4.1.2 Values of the Characteristic
Here, the following values are distinguished:
1. no cargo and no persons, therefore no speciﬁc occupant or cargo protection interests
2. cargo approved for transportation
3. person/s with agreed destinations
4. persons with non-agreed destinations.
One use case can be covered by several values of this characteristic. The distinction
between value 3 and 4 is made in order to distinguish between individual and public
transportation. A vehicle of individual transportation carries persons with agreed desti-
nations. In contrast, a vehicle of public transportation carries multiple persons who have
not previously agreed upon a destination. However, persons reach their destinations with
public transportation, because a schedule with destinations and intermediate stops is
established.

Use Cases for Autonomous Driving
21
2.4.2
Characteristic B: Maximum Permitted Gross Weight
2.4.2.1 Motivation
The maximum permitted gross weight inﬂuences safety considerations via kinetic energy.
Besides safety considerations, looking at gross weight extends the discussion beyond
individual transportation to public transportation, freight transportation as well as road
infrastructure. In addition, this characteristic addresses the question of vehicle types,
which potentially are not compatible with current vehicle types because of the autono-
mous driving functions and changing requirements, on a high level. Instead of considering
the boundaries of often country-speciﬁc vehicle classes, four mass attributes are chosen.
They range in values from ultra-light vehicles to heavy trucks and each step spans a factor
of 4 between types.
2.4.2.2 Values of the Characteristic
Discrete distinctions have been established in order to describe the imagined use cases and
to roughly categorize their mass. An exact determination of the mass is possible for
existing use cases and speciﬁed deployment. Characteristic B covers the following values:
1. ultra-light vehicles around 500 kg
2. passenger vehicle around 2 t
3. light commercial trucks and vans around 8 t
4. trucks around 32 t.
2.4.3
Characteristic C: Maximum Deployment Velocity
2.4.3.1 Motivation
The characteristic of maximum deployment velocity (to be precise the square of the
velocity) determines, multiplied with the mass, the kinetic energy of a vehicle, and
therefore also needs to be distinguished. In addition, stopping distance is calculated using
the square of the velocity. Accordingly, the autonomous system’s requirements regarding
a risk-minimal state in case of failure or when reaching functional limitations grow with
the velocity squared.
Besides safety considerations, travel time and the range achievable in a given time at a
given deployment velocity are also values that inﬂuence individual mobility. In addition,
the deployment velocity directly deﬁnes the road type which can be used if a minimum
velocity is required for using it.
22
W. Wachenfeld et al.
2.4.3.2 Values of Characteristic
The maximum deployment velocity, characteristic C, has ﬁve proxy values, one for
walking speed, and four in steps with a factor of two (= factor 4 in terms of kinetic energy
and stopping distance). For concrete use cases the values and regulations need to be
adapted to the respective deployment. Discrete distinctions have been established in order
to describe the imagined use cases and to roughly categorize their velocity. An exact
determination of the velocity is possible for existing use cases and deﬁned deployments.
1. up to 5 km/h
2. up to 30 km/h
3. up to 60 km/h
4. up to 120 km/h
5. up to 240 km/h.
2.4.4
Characteristic D: Scenery
2.4.4.1 Motivation
Which spatial areas accessible to the driver through the driver-only automobile will also
be made accessible with the described use case of autonomous driving? The scenery
characteristic describes the spatial deployment in which the vehicle drives autonomously.
For instance, do standardized structures exist, how many lanes are available, and do other
markings exist?
Even static scenery can be diverse and present a challenge for the driving robot. One
example of this, as is often mentioned, is trafﬁc lanes covered with snow, or trafﬁc signs
hidden by bushes or trees. Such conditions, which are potentially unknown and
non-changeable at the beginning of a journey, will not be considered with this charac-
teristic. Determining the extent to which the driving robot can deal with scenery and
conditions rests on the assumption that the robot can accomplish the driving task as well
as a human driver.
This characteristic therefore describes scenarios that are predictable and that follow
existing rules on a high level (location, environment and function of the road).
2.4.4.2 Values of the Characteristic
Dimension: type of scenery
1. off-road terrain
2. agricultural road
3. parking lot or parking structure
4. access road
2
Use Cases for Autonomous Driving
23
5. main trafﬁc roads
6. urban arterial road
7. country road
8. interstate
9. special areas.
The scenery characteristic in its ﬁrst dimension covers 9 values (the scenery types from
the German guidelines for integrated network design [5] were expanded) (Table 2.5):
Besides this value that describes the scenery within which a speciﬁc use case can be
performed, the characteristic has a second dimension, which is the condition whether access
to the scenery has to be permitted explicitly or not. The respective values are the following:
a. Without permission allowed: All sceneries of this kind are permitted for driving robot
operation.
b. Only with permission allowed: Only selected and permitted sceneries of this kind
permit a driving robot to operate autonomously in this area.
For now, it is left open who grants this permission and whether that is a private or
public administration. In that sense, the type of permission is not further speciﬁed, for
example the infrastructure could be in maintenance mode or a map could be provided,
enriched with additional information. And also, the permission could include a temporary
component and statistical or dynamic cutoff times for speciﬁc scenery areas.

Use Cases for Autonomous Driving
25
2.4.5
Characteristic E: Dynamic Elements
2.4.5.1 Motivation
Besides the scenery, the complexity of a scene depends largely on dynamic elements. The
dynamic elements in the scene with the autonomously driving vehicle extend the
requirements on the driving abilities of the driving robot. Therefore this characteristic
describes to what extent the use case can be deployed in the current trafﬁc situation and if
limitations or exclusions for the dynamic elements are considered.
2.4.5.2 Values of the Characteristic
Four values of the characteristic are distinguished (Table 2.6):
1. without exclusion
2. only motor vehicles
3. only autonomously driving vehicles
4. no other dynamic elements.
The exclusion of other dynamic elements for the values 2–4 is not determined in an
absolute way. The scene on a contemporary interstate is described for instance through
value (2) only motor vehicles. However, while the situation that one person or cyclist steps
on the interstate applies in theory, it is disregarded here due to the respective probability of
occurrence. According to the assumption in Sect. 2.2 that most likely there will be a
mixed operation, only the values 1 and 2 will be used for the use cases.

26
W. Wachenfeld et al.
2.4.6
Characteristic F: Information Flow Between the Driving
Robot and Other Entities
2.4.6.1 Motivation
As described in Sect. 2.5, the driving robot carries out the tasks of perception, cognition,
behavior decision and behavior execution. To do so, information about the state of the
vehicle driven by the robot is required, such as position and velocity, but also information
about the environment and occupants. This information is derived either from sensors,
reading from memory systems, or through communication. How and which information is
exchanged between the driving robot and respective entities is deﬁned by the purpose of
the information ﬂow. In order to describe the information ﬂow for one use case, the
purposes of information exchange are assigned to the use cases.
The availability of the information, its transmission, and the communication partner all
have to be suitable for the deployment purpose. As already mentioned, it is additionally
assumed that the technology is only introduced onto the market slowly. Therefore not all
dynamic elements in the vicinity are able to participate in the information exchange, so
that a mixed operation has to be assumed.
The information ﬂow of the driving robot considered herein is a subset of the entire
information ﬂow of the vehicle. We shall for the moment disregard purposes that are part
of infotainment and convenience systems. Current news, access to social networks, or
music streaming may as speciﬁc services increase the additional beneﬁt of the autonomous
journey; however, the information ﬂow of these services is not primarily relevant for
autonomous driving. Therefore only purposes impacting trafﬁc safety, trafﬁc efﬁciency, as
well as purposes that are potentially prerequisites for the autonomous journey, are
described as distinguishing attributes.
2.4.6.2 Values of the Characteristic
Eight purposes of the information ﬂow are distinguished (Table 2.7):
1. navigation optimization
2. path-tracking optimization
3. control optimization
4. provision of environmental information
5. updating the driving robot’s capability
6. monitoring the driving robot
7. monitoring occupants
8. occupant emergency call.
The ﬁrst three values might also lead to interactions to negotiate the temporal or spatial
usage of the trafﬁc infrastructure. For now this interaction is disregarded.

Value
Description
Navigation optimization
– Information such as current position, route destination, ﬂow
velocity, weather, etc. are exchanged with an inter-regional
trafﬁc center. Inter-regional in this context means that the
information relevant for navigation lies within the coverage area
(several hundred kilometers) of the trafﬁc central unit
– Goals of the optimization are, for example, low energy
consumption and CO2-emission, a travel time or travel distance
that is as short as possible
Path-tracking optimization
– Extensive information about the state (x, v, a, …) and intention
of the vehicle driven by a robot as well as information of the
vehicles in the immediate vicinity are exchanged
– Information regarding weather, road condition, congestion, road
closures, and phase timing of trafﬁc lights are shared with a local
trafﬁc center. Local in this context means a coverage area of a
few kilometers around the vehicle
– The goal is, for example, synchronized drive in lateral as well as
longitudinal directions (platooning, intersections without signage,
or adaptive lanes…)
Control optimization
– The vehicle states selected and the intentions of the driving
robot, road users, and further elements in the immediate vicinity
of the vehicle are exchanged
– The goal is collision avoidance in lateral and longitudinal
direction with one or several vehicles in the immediate vicinity,
according to already existing V2X concepts
Provision of
environmental information
– Information about the vehicle environment, which is perceived
by the driving robot, is shared with road users as well as with a
trafﬁc center in the immediate vicinity
– The goal is to serve an optimized map with information as a
source for positioning, hazard recognition, navigation, etc.
Updating the driving
robot’s capability
– The manufacturer provides an update, which improves the
(driving-) capabilities of the driving robot
Monitoring the driving
robot
– Information about the status, capabilities, and intentions of the
driving robot are shared with authorized entities
– The goal is to secure evidence (event data recording) to
reconstruct the course of an accident, similar to a black box in
aviation
– Malfunctions and hazardous situations that are identiﬁed through
self-diagnosis are transmitted to the manufacturer

2.4.7
Characteristic G: Availability Concept
2.4.7.1 Motivation
During normal operation the driving robot controls the vehicle within the permitted area.
If the driving robot reaches a generally non-predictable functional limitation, the driving
robot hands over to a speciﬁed availability concept. This availability concept deﬁnes how
to continue the driving mission. Such functional limitations can be unknown obstacles on
the road, which no longer permit a continuation within the autonomy of decision-making.
An example for such an obstacle is a branch extending to the road, so that the vehicle
needs to touch the branch in order to continue the journey. The extent to which the
availability concept takes over the entire driving task, or just takes over the
decision-making, is left open intentionally.
2.4.7.2 Values of the Characteristic
The following availability concepts are distinguished (Table 2.8):
1. no additional availability
2. availability through driver
3. tele-operated driving
4. pilot service
5. electric towing.
The handover from the driving robot to the alternative availability concept is to be
implemented risk-minimally. The driving robot transfers the vehicle for the handover to
that risk-minimal state which is suitable for the transfer to the availability concept.
The respective interfaces for the availability through driver, remote control, a pilot, or
towing need to be available.

Description
Monitoring occupants
– Information (video, audio, heart rate…) about the occupant,
which characterize his/her condition, are shared with an
emergency call center or a service provider
– The goal is to monitor the health and safety of the occupant
– Information will be forwarded to authorized receivers without the
intention and action of the occupant
Occupant emergency call
– If the occupant experiences an emergency related either to him-/
herself or the autonomous journey, it is possible to contact an
emergency call center or the service provider of the autonomous
journey
– Occupant initiates contact and shares information voluntarily

Use Cases for Autonomous Driving

2.4.8
Characteristic H: Extension Concept
2.4.8.1 Motivation
Not necessarily all areas necessary for the transportation task will be covered with the help
of autonomous driving, especially not at the beginning of its introduction. Subdomains
will remain which cannot be controlled autonomously. Nevertheless, in order to fulﬁll the
mobility needs of customers, portions outside the regime of automated driving can be
covered with extension concepts. The extension concept describes whether and with what
aid it becomes possible to perform the vehicle control outside the area speciﬁed for
autonomous driving.
2.4.8.2 Values of the Characteristic
Characteristic H has 5 values (Table 2.9):
1. No substitute beyond the operating area, i.e. the autonomous driving area covers the
speciﬁed transportation tasks completely. The vehicle with this value is an
exclusive-autonomous vehicle. If the deployment also covers the entire deployment of
current vehicles, it is a fully autonomous vehicle.
2. Driver: A human takes over the driving task.
3. Tele-operated driving: The driving task is performed by an external operator.
4. Pilot service: An especially trained person takes over the driving task in a speciﬁc regime.
5. Extra transportation device: At the boundaries of deployment, the driving robot
coordinates the handover of the vehicle to an extra transportation device so that this
transportation device can continue the transportation task. Possible examples would be
the long-distance transport of urban vehicles with the help of a road train or a concept
similar to an electronic tow-bar.

W. Wachenfeld et al.
If the driver is considered (the driver value), it is inevitably necessary that a vehicle
control interface (driver workplace) is available. In addition it is assumed that a capable
person holding a driver’s license is an occupant for the journey outside the autonomous
driving area. For other cases, values that are futuristic from today’s perspective (tele-
operated driving as well as pilot service), a necessary service/interface needs to be pro-
vided for these alternatives.
2.4.9
Characteristic I: Options for Intervention
2.4.9.1 Motivation
According to Donges [3], the three primary driving tasks of navigation, guidance, and
stabilization need to be fulﬁlled in order to guide a vehicle to the desired destination of the
journey. Löper and Flemisch [6] as well as others replaces stabilization by the term
control. The task of control covers the stabilization and in addition vehicle control in si-
tuations of vehicle-dynamics instability. Therefore, the primary driving tasks will be
navigation, guidance, and control.
According to the deﬁnition of fully automated driving, this driving task is transferred
completely to the driving robot. When a destination is indicated to the driving robot, it
fulﬁlls the navigation, guidance, and control tasks and guides the vehicle to the desired
destination. Although the driving robot will execute these tasks, the internal system
architecture is not necessarily structured in such a way.
In contrast, with the exception of hazardous situations (electronic stability control,
anti-lock braking system, automated emergency braking), the driver is in control of

Use Cases for Autonomous Driving
31
current production vehicles (overwrite capability). The human fulﬁlls the driving tasks at
the driver workplace in the vehicle. Thus he/she currently has the option to correct the
actions of assistance systems, i.e. to override them.
Therefore there are two entities, the occupant as well as the driving robot, which
basically have the capability to control the vehicle.
In addition, ideas and concepts for remote vehicle operation (tele-operated) exist, in
which entities external to the vehicle intervene in the vehicle guidance. If a communi-
cation link as well as a respective interface for the world outside of the vehicle exists,
these external entities also have the capability to inﬂuence the vehicle control. Therefore,
in total three groups of entities—internal, vehicle, and external—can be distinguished
which can intervene with the vehicle control during the autonomous journey.
To simplify the description of this characteristic, the occupants (adults, minors, people
with limiting disability etc.) are summarized as the internal group. Inﬂuences outside the
vehicle (law enforcement (e.g. police), registered vehicle owners (if not part of internal
group), authorized agents etc.) are summarized as the external group.
If the entities are considered independently, the following questions regarding their
options for intervention apply:
1. On which level of vehicle control does the entity have the option to intervene?
2. For which level of vehicle control does the entity have the authorization to intervene?
The ﬁrst is answered via the vehicle concept of the use case. If the entity is supposed to
have the option for intervention, an appropriate interface in the vehicle concept is pro-
vided to the entity.
The second question requires a statutory rule that deﬁnes which authorization is assigned
to entities according to their properties and responsibilities. At this point it will not be further
elaborated who sets and checks these rules, whether there is a driving test of some sort for the
different levels, and if authorizations such as a driver’s license or access codes are needed.
From this, the following combinations of options for interventions that the vehicle
provides and the authorization for intervention that the entity possesses result:
a. The vehicle concept offers the option for intervention on one of the three levels
(navigation, guidance and control) and the entity is authorized to intervene on the same
level of the driving task. Therefore the entity can intervene.
b. The vehicle concept offers the option, but the entity is not authorized to intervene on
one level. This situation correlates to a child that is in the driver’s seat. For the use
cases, it is assumed for this situation that the law for this situation regulates the
intervention by the entity.
c. The vehicle concept does not offer the option, but the entity is authorized to intervene
on one level. This correlates to a driver in the back seat, who cannot intervene.
d. The use case offers the option on one level, however the entity is authorized to
intervene on a different level of the driving task. Also with this combination, the
intervention is not permitted to the entity.
32
W. Wachenfeld et al.
Only with combination (a) can the driving robot be inﬂuenced and/or overruled by the
entity on one level of the driving task.
For the description of the use cases it follows that those entities are listed for which at
least one authorization matches one available option of the vehicle concept.
In addition, it is assumed that statutory regulation will punish and therefore preclude
misuse. This assumption also applies to current vehicle concepts. For example, it is not
technology that prevents children from driving a vehicle, but rather the respective statu-
tory regulation in combination with required supervision.
If the entities are now considered simultaneously and the entities are therefore able to
act simultaneously on the three levels, the third question applies.
3. Which entity is dominant and how is the hierarchy of the entities deﬁned in case of a
conﬂict because of simultaneous interventions (Fig. 2.9)?
In order to answer this question for the description of the use cases, the intervention of
the entities has to be attributed with a certain hierarchy. Which entity dominates others
and thereby decides the vehicle behavior on the different levels of the driving task? A
hierarchy of the entities needs to be implemented in the vehicle design.
In this it needs to be acknowledged that, in addition to the hierarchy of the entities,
there also needs to be a hierarchy of the levels for the driving task. Control always
overrules guidance and guidance always overrules navigation. Therefore it is additionally
deﬁned that internal or external entities can intervene only on one level. The entity with
the highest priority suppresses other interventions.
Through autonomous driving it is also possible to exclusively transport persons who
are not able to perform the driving task or to change the driving mission. However, in
order to provide occupants with the option to exit safely as fast as possible, the safe exit is
introduced as a special driving mission. If the occupant gains access to the safe exit with
the highest priority, he/she might not necessarily be able to change the destination of the
journey, but can exit the vehicle as fast as possible.

Use Cases for Autonomous Driving
33
2.5
General Definitions
Some basic terms, which will be used in the following sections, are deﬁned as follows:
navigation—according to Donges [3], navigation includes choosing an appropriate
driving route from the available road network as well as an estimation of the expected
time requirement. If there is information about current interferences, such as accidents,
road works or trafﬁc jams, a change in route planning may be necessary.
guidance—according to Donges [3], the task of guidance is basically to derive the
advisable command variables, such as the intended track and the set-point speed, from the
road situation ahead as well as from the planned route. Part of the guidance is also to
anticipatorily intervene the open-loop control to create favorable conditions for the lowest
possible deviations between set and actual values.
stabilization (control)—to fulﬁll the stabilization task, according to Donges [3], the
driver has to ensure with corrective actions that the deviations in the closed-loop control
are stabilized and compensated to a level for which the driver is capable of handling.
driver only—ground (0) level of automation according to BASt [1]: “the driver contin-
uously (throughout the complete trip) accomplishes longitudinal (accelerating/braking)
and lateral (steering) control.”
assisted—the ﬁrst (1) level of automation according to BASt [1]: “the driver continuously
accomplishes either lateral or longitudinal control. The other/remaining task is accom-
plished by the automating system to a certain level only.
• The driver must permanently monitor the system.
• The driver must at any time be prepared to take over complete control of the vehicle.”
fully automated—the fourth (4) level of automation according to BASt [1]: “the system
takes over lateral and longitudinal control completely within the individual speciﬁcation
of the application.
• The driver does not need to monitor the system.
• Before the speciﬁed limits of the application are reached, the system requests the driver
to take over with a sufﬁcient time buffer.
• In the absence of a takeover, the system will return to the minimal risk condition by
itself.
• All system limits are detected by the system, the system is capable of returning to the
minimum risk condition in all situations.”
autonomous driving—for autonomous driving, the driving task [3] is performed in a way
that is called fully automated (level 4 automation according to BASt [1]). This deﬁnition is
extended by the assumption that the machine behavior stays within an initially set
behavioral framework.
machine driving capabilities—the machine (driving) capabilities are capabilities related
to perception, cognition, behavior decisions as well as behavior execution.
34
W. Wachenfeld et al.
driving robot—a driving robot is the implementation of the machine’s (driving) capa-
bilities. The driving robot consists of hardware components (sensors, processors, and
actuators) and software elements. It acts as the hardware and software, equivalent to the
role of a driver in today’s vehicles as subject1 (the deﬁnition term for this system is still
incomplete, so alternative suggestions are welcomed).
fully autonomous vehicle—a fully autonomous vehicle is a vehicle which can drive
almost all routes autonomously, on the same level as driver-only vehicles. This deﬁnition
is beyond the BASt [1] deﬁnition as it deﬁnes the vehicle and not the degree of
automation.
exclusively autonomous vehicle (autonomous-only vehicle)—an exclusively autono-
mous vehicle is a vehicle which can drive all routes for which the vehicle has been
speciﬁed autonomously from start to destination. This deﬁnition is beyond the BASt [1]
deﬁnition as it deﬁnes the vehicle and not the degree of automation.
transportation task—the driving task describes a deﬁned transportation object (vehicle,
cargo, passenger etc.) that is transported from one start location to a destination location.
Examples of the transportation task include park vehicle or get passenger to the requested
destination.
driving mission—the driving mission describes the journey from start to destination in
execution of the transportation task.
safe exit—the safe exit is a special driving mission. It leads the vehicle in the fastest way
to a system status which allows the passengers to safely exit the vehicle.
driver—a driver is the human operator of a vehicle, without further specifying the driving
capability. This means within a range of humans who have a driver’s license. The driver is
the subject of autonomy in case of non-fully automated driving.
scenery—the term scenery according to Geyer et al. [8] refers to the static environment of
the vehicle. This takes into consideration the geometry of pre-deﬁned road types, number
of lanes, curvature, position of trafﬁc signs and trafﬁc lights, as well as additional sta-
tionary objects such as construction areas and natural (e.g. bushes and trees) or man-made
objects (e.g. buildings, walls).
dynamic elements—dynamic elements according to Geyer et al. [8] are temporary and
spatially variable elements such as other road users, states of trafﬁc lights, light as well as
trafﬁc conditions.
scene—the scene according to Geyer et al. [8] is built by the scenery, dynamic elements
and optional driving instructions. A scene starts with the end of the earlier scene or—in
case of the ﬁrst scene—with a deﬁned starting scene. Within a scene the elements, their
behavior as well as the position of the autonomously driving vehicle are deﬁned. The
dynamic elements change their states within a scene.
1A system which is capable of taking decisions depending on sensor data processed internally has
additional degrees of freedom as compared to one with direct sensor data to actuator feedback or one
without any capability of control actuation. The former one is termed a ‘subject’, the last one an
‘object’… [7].

situation—a clear deﬁnition of the term situation for the use-case description is still to be
determined. In particular, an “objective, complete situation (description)” has to be dis-
tinguished from a “subjective, projective situation (description)”.
operating area—a spatial and/or temporal area, speciﬁed explicitly via the scenery and
implicitly via the velocity, in which the vehicle can be moved autonomously through the
operation of the driving robot.
operating limit2—the operating limit is speciﬁed explicitly through the scenery and
implicitly through the velocity, and is therefore a predictable boundary at which the
driving task is handed over.
functional limit3—a condition that appears in the permitted operation range but is not
predictable in detail, which contradicts with continuing the autonomous journey. Even if
the limit is not foreseeable, the driving robot recognizes it at an early stage.

Man and Machine
The very act of driving conjures a range of strong and very human emotions. Whether it is
the feeling of freedom that the mobility of the car provides, the frustration of being stuck
in trafﬁc, the panic when realizing a potential collision looms or the joy of an open road
with a favorite song on the radio, driving is a human experience. With automated vehicles,
however, that experience changes—both for passengers in the automated car and other
road users who must walk or drive alongside it as part of the social experience of trafﬁc.
The car ceases to be simply an extension of its human driver and becomes an agent in its
own right, navigating through the highways and rules of human society. Given the
sometimes uneasy relationship between humans and machines, what will these new
interactions between humans and machines look like?
Fabian Kroeger sets the stage for this discussion by showing what our cultural heritage
reﬂects about our views of automation. In his chapter, Das automatisierte Fahren im
gesellschaftsgeschichtlichen und kulturwissenschaftlichen Kontext, he details the long
history of automated vehicle concepts and their treatment in media, beginning with
Utopian visions of the beneﬁts of such technology. His chapter traces the path from this
early optimism towards the more cautionary themes found in recent ﬁlm depictions of our
automated future. This frames a central question running through the remaining chapters
—how can the challenges of human-machine interaction be overcome to realize the
promise of this technology?
A key aspect of that interaction is how automated cars will conform to the ethical
standards of the human world in which they operate. Patrick Lin opens this topic with an
overall discussion of Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars. Even with the best
technology imaginable, sometimes crashes will be unavoidable for automated vehicles
that share the road with human drivers and programmers must decide what to do when
presented with such dilemma situations. As Lin shows, such decisions raise issues of
equity, discrimination and unintended consequences that must be thoughtfully considered.
Christian Gerdes and Sarah Thornton take the programming aspect of this discussion a
step further with Implementable Ethics for Automated Vehicles. Mapping philosophical
concepts to engineering concepts, they demonstrate how different approaches to ethical
reasoning can be turned into algorithms that make decisions for automated vehicles. The
J. Christian Gerdes
correct choice of an ethical framework for automated vehicles is far from obvious,
however, and they argue that there are beneﬁts to taking a more deontological, or
rule-based, approach to dilemma situations and a more consequentialist, or outcome-based
approach to operating in trafﬁc.
Interactions in trafﬁc and societal acceptance depend not only upon the programming in
the automated vehicles but how the automated vehicles are understood—or misunderstood
—by the people around them. Ingo Wolf, in his chapter Wechselwirkung Mensch und
autonomer Agent, discusses the psychological concept of a mental model and how such
models can be critical in deﬁning human interactions with automated systems. He outlines
several possible mental models for interactions between humans and automated vehicles
and, using the results of an online survey, shows which are closest to current perceptions
of this technology.
This part concludes with a look at the speciﬁc challenge presented by the informal
communication channels that humans use to interpret the intentions to other road users or
signal their own intentions. Berthold Faerber demonstrates the importance of nonverbal
communication such as eye contact and gesture in his chapter Verhandlungen/
Kommunikation von autonomen Fahrzeugen; Kompensation von Fehlern anderer
Verkehrsteilnehmer. This raises a range of questions such as how eye contact with
someone in the driver seat of an automated vehicle who is not actually driving may be
interpreted and what possibilities for new communication modalities might exist.

Introduction
The fascination with the promise of automotive autonomy has historically rested primarily
on human drivers’ control of the gas pedal, steering wheel and brakes. Steering a car is the
only area where the love of power and imagination still has free rein, observed the
semiologist Roland Barthes in 1963 [3, p. 241]. The sociologist Henri Lefebvre also
emphasized that the automobile was the last refuge of chance and risk in an increasingly
controlled and managed society [23, p. 192].
Concealed in this risk, however, is not only freedom: there is also the threat of fatal
accidents. In this sense, the car both runs with and against the grain of “the utopia of
modernity,” as emphasized by cultural scientist Käte Meyer-Drawe [27, p. 111f].
The vision of man driving himself was therefore accompanied early on by the dream of
self-steering cars bringing us safely to our desired destination. It is astonishing that the
fulﬁllment of this wish has always remained 20 years away for almost the last 100 years
[50, p. 14]. Between an automobile controlled by a driver and one that transports pas-
sengers, there is evidently not only a technological break, but above all a cultural one.
Driverless vehicles have played a prime role in our imaginings of technology, their history
is largely a pictorial one.

will see how the logic of automatic automobiles unfolds as a fantastical object between the
weird and the wonderful.1
3.2
Early Aviation and Radio Technology Lays the Foundation
The story of the driverless car begins in the USA in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century.
At this time, the sharp rise in fatal trafﬁc accidents was becoming a social problem. Mass
motorization had begun in the USA as early as the 1920s—three decades earlier than in
Europe. More Americans were killed in auto accidents in the ﬁrst four years after the First
World War alone than in total in France up to that point [32, p. 25]. Overall, motorized
road transport led to the accidental deaths of around 200,000 US citizens in the 1920s; by
far the greatest number of these were pedestrians (ibid., p. 21).
Driver error was seen as being the prime cause of accidents. That infrastructure and
vehicle design are also critical factors in accidents’ form and severity was at ﬁrst little
acknowledged. The idea of substituting error-prone humans with technology thus prac-
tically suggested itself.
Two new technological developments from the ﬁelds of aviation and radio engineering
belonged to the material conditions that an accident-free, self-driving automobile ﬁrst
made conceivable:
Firstly, in Bezons near Paris, France in June 1914, Lawrence B. Sperry (1892–1923)
introduced the ﬁrst gyroscopic Airplane Stabilizer, which today is seen as the ﬁrst
autopilot. Before the eyes of astonished spectators, his mechanic climbed out onto the
right wing during the ﬂight, while in the cockpit Sperry stood up and raised his hands
above his head. The system was based on the gyrocompass, which his father Elmer A.
Sperry (1860–1930) had invented [6, p. 183]. It automatically equilibrated the aircraft,
although it did not fully relieve the pilot of steering duties. John Hays Hammond (1888–
1965) introduced a system for automatic course stabilization at around the same time. The
inventions of Sperry and Hammond paved the way for the commercialization of autopilots
[11, p. 1253 ff; 17, p. 1258 ff].
Secondly, radio technology was one of the technical requirements needed to be able to
create a self-driving car. The new science of radio guidance was engaged with the remote
control of moving mechanisms by means of radio waves [16, p. 171]. This technology
was developed, amongst others, by the US military, which was experimenting with
remote-controlled torpedos, ships and aircraft.
1Note: The terms self-steering, automatic and autonomous vehicles are used here interchangeably.

3.3
Technical Beginnings: Driverless, but not Self-steering
These pioneering works led to the ﬁrst driverless car, which engineers of the Radio Air
Service introduced to the public on the McCook air force test base in Dayton, Ohio on 5
August, 1921.
The 2.5 m-long car (Fig. 3.1) was controlled via radio from an army truck driving
30 m behind. Technically speaking this, then, was not an autonomously self-driving
vehicle, but rather a remote-controlled one—just that the driver was outside the car. What
is noteworthy here is that the history of driverless cars is linked to the military, and was a
media story right from the beginning—the press reported on it and published photos of the
prototype [33].
In 1925 another remote controlled auto named American Wonder caused a sensation as
it drove on Broadway in New York [37].2 It was developed by the Houdina Radio Control
Company. Military know-how also played a role here: Francis P. Houdina had worked as
Fig. 3.1 The ﬁrst remote-controlled vehicle (USA 1921)—The Daily Ardmoreite, 12 August,

incorrectly recorded as Linnrican Wonder. This was carried over to numerous articles.

an electrical engineer in the US Army. American Wonder was also steered by remote
control from a second vehicle.
In the 1930s, various offshoots of these remote-controlled automobiles appeared in
public. At the one hand it was to be used as a commercial advertising vehicle, due to its
notable qualities in terms of an attention economy. At the other hand it was taking a
leading role in the so-called Safety Parades (Fig. 3.2) for road transport safety under the
management of Captain J.J. Lynch.
From 1931 to 1949, Lynch gave demonstrations of the remote-controlled vehicle in 37
of the 48 US states. In 1934 he even demonstrated it in Australia. He manipulated the
brakes, steering wheel and horn of the vehicle driving in front of him with the aid of a
morse key. A spherical antenna received the code, although there are also reports of a wire
between the vehicles. In Buffalo and at Utica Airport in 1933, the car was even controlled
from an airplane.
The driverless vehicle was almost perfectly suited to transport safety campaigns. On
the occasion of a driving-safety campaign, Lynch stressed that modern automobiles’
safety depended on the driver. Because the driverless automobile obeyed all trafﬁc rules, it
would serve as an example for car drivers.
3.4
Between the Weird and the Wonderful
The press announced the remote-controlled automobile as the phantom auto [34], robot
car [36] or magic car [35]. These metaphors show that the driverless car was perceived as
a fantastical object from early on. To this day, it takes precisely that place between the
weird and the wonderful that Tzvetan Todorov ascribes to fantasy literature [44].

F. Kröger
“We sped off with no-one holding the steering wheel, whizzed round corners, dodged
other equally ﬁne powered carriages, nobody honked their horn” [20, p. 7f]. In his early
automation utopia Utopolis (1930), the German writer Werner Illing describes the wonder
of “secretly self-steering autos” (ibid., p. 37). We are moving into a society where “the
automatic machine” has replaced “work done by hand” (ibid., p. 19)—and also steering
done by hand. “The most wonderfullest (sic) thing about it was that the car (…) behaved
as if it had learnt all possible trafﬁc rules by heart.” (ibid., p. 38). As in Lynch’s Safety
Shows in the USA, the particular attraction of the driverless car here consists in keeping to
social norms.
The technical side of this literary utopia is also explained. Each car has a small prism
eye at the front, which communicates with the trafﬁc lights that are “embedded incon-
spicuously in house walls.” “These mechanical eyes regulate speed and steering via
alternating reﬂected images” (ibid.). There is even a navigation system that is reminiscent
of today’s GPS devices:
In place of the steering wheel I found a metal plate in which the map of the city was very
ﬁnely and clearly etched. Above this a pin-sharp pointer. I had hardly begun to move this
before the car started up and ran down streets I had never been down before. (ibid., p. 38).
The description of wonderful self-steering automobiles is followed by the literary
embellishment of its weird potential. In his short story The Living Machine (1935), the US
science ﬁction author David H. Keller describes the invention of a self-driving car that can
be navigated with spoken instructions [21]. At ﬁrst, the beneﬁts are spelled out. The
“living machine” has contributed to a drop in the rate of accidents and opened up the car
to new classes of users (ibid., p. 1467):
Old people began to cross the continent in their own cars. Young people found the driverless
car admirable for petting. The blind for the ﬁrst time were safe. Parents found they could more
safely send their children to school in the new car than in the old cars with a chauffeur. (ibid.,
p. 1470).
The story turns when a mechanic notices that the cars have come to life. “Cars, without
control, coursed the public highways, chasing pedestrians, killing little children, smashing
fences.” (ibid., p. 1473). This imaginary phantasm of loss of control to driverless
machines was to be the dominant template for the rest of the century.
3.5
Only a Driverless Car is a Safe Car
The driverless car received its ﬁrst screen appearance in the American road safety edu-
cation ﬁlm The Safest Place (1935). Commissioned by General Motors (GM) and pro-
duced by Jam Handy (1886–1983), this short ﬁlm shows a car with no driver sticking to
the trafﬁc regulations in exemplary fashion. The vehicle always stays in its lane, never
forgets to signal when turning, obeys all stop signs and never overtakes on dangerous
3
Automated Driving in Its Social, Historical and Cultural Contexts
45
corners. Lynch had given similar reasons for campaigning for safety with driverless
vehicles.
The Safest Place does not portray a vision of the self-driving car as a technically
achievable possibility, but rather as a moral model for further thought. Only drivers are
held responsible for accidents in this ﬁlm. They were shown as far more important for
safety than technology—which is precisely why they should behave like automatons.
The ﬁlm’s blind spot is the machine: it is not seen as a risk factor. The fact that
accidents also happen when the driver has made no mistake goes unmentioned. This is not
surprising, as the car industry at that time was not yet convinced of the need for carrying
out safety research [42, p. 161]. Visually, the ﬁlm sums up this paradox of the infallible
machine impressively. The camera ﬁlms the car’s interior from the back seat and, as if by
a ghost’s hand, the steering wheel turns. The front seats are empty.
This approach is noteworthy, as the self-steering car appears to have disposed of all its
occupants. Their bodies have been taken out of the car and out of the picture. They are
now sitting outside the car in the movie theatre, in front of the screen. Only their gaze
permits the audience to visually put itself back in the position of a traveler in the car. In
ironic fashion, the ﬁlm points here to the contradiction between safety and freedom: Is the
car only safe when empty?
3.6
Guide Wires Become Utopian Guiding Principles
It is not only literary and ﬁlmic fantasies that surround the driverless car. At around the
same time—the mid-1930s—the American oil and auto industries began working on
ultramodern designs for the highways of the future together with urban planners, industrial
designers, architects, transport researchers, and policy makers [50, p. 2]. At this time,
automatic driving moved away from the early attempts at remote control, and was
upgraded to a guiding principle of an automated transport system. The concept of the
automated street was projected onto real landscapes, though immediate implementation
was not planned. It was rather to act as a beacon in rebuilding trust in capitalism.
Many US citizens had lost their faith in technological progress as a result of the Great
Depression. The planning elite were thus drawn to propaganda boosters that were
designed to return the luster to technological promises of salvation.
Popular science magazines such as Popular Science and Popular Mechanics played an
important role in this. They were heavily illustrated, which makes them valuable sources
for studying pictorial history. In May 1938, Popular Science reported on the automatic
transport of the future for the ﬁrst time [31]. The author introduced the so-called
guide-wire vision, which was to remain a cultural guiding principle up to the 1970s. All
vehicles were to follow an electromagnetic wire sunk into the road surface whose impulse
regulated speed and steering (ibid., p. 28). The justiﬁcation for the design was the need to
end the “slaughter” caused by human driving error and bad roads (ibid., p. 118).
46
F. Kröger
Astonishingly, this early guide-wire vision foresaw the switch from manual to automatic
control (ibid., p. 27).
Of particular interest here is the accompanying drawing by the illustrator Benjamin
Goodwin Seielstad (1866–1960), which develops a utopian pictorial language that was to
crop up in connection with automatic driving again and again over the decades (Fig. 3.3).
Firstly, we look with a bird’s-eye view onto the freeway of the future, which leads
arrow-straight to a vanishing point on the skyline. The shining white roadways merge as
they head across the panorama’s horizon. The perspective emphatically signposts the path
of progress to a better tomorrow. The strategically deployed vanishing point emphasizes
the picture’s message. In the way it moves with the viewer, and thus unattainably leads to
nowhere, it has an afﬁnity with the utopian.
Secondly, the exceedingly high viewpoint underscores the panorama’s meaning. The
view onto the freeway appears to be the perspective from a hot-air balloon. The visual
distance underlines that the vision is only in draft form, which we, along with Ernst Bloch,
may name as a “landscape of desire” [5, p. 935].

Popular Science explained the vision illustrated in the article by calling on Miller
McClintock (1894–1960), Director of the Bureau for Street Trafﬁc Research at Harvard
University. McClintock was one of the most important masterminds of US transport
planning [32]. In his doctoral thesis, he had analyzed the causes of trafﬁc jams and
accidents as early as 1925, and developed new trafﬁc regulations and road construction
works [26].
Signiﬁcant impetus for automatic driving was provided by a large oil company. In the
spring of 1937, Shell brought McClintock together with Bel Geddes, a pioneer of
streamlining. For a Shell advertisement, they were to design a model of the City of
Tomorrow [32, p. 249]. Bel Geddes [4] had already written about urbanism and car design
in his book Horizons in 1932, but it was the Shell job that ﬁrst had him developing the
vision of automatic highways. In May 1938, he managed to convince GM to further
develop the Shell model for the 1939 New York World’s Fair.
3.7
Self-driving Transport in General Motors’ Futurama
“Strange? Fantastic? Unbelievable? Remember, this is the world of 1960!” [13, p. 8]. At
the World’s Fair, the utopia of driverless cars was given its ﬁrst big stage. Building the
World of Tomorrow proclaimed the fair’s motto, promising a technologically improved
future while daily life was marked by economic depression and forebodings of imminent
war. The most popular show at the World’s Fair was GM’s still-legendary Futurama, with
its model of future transport systems. The term Futurama is derived from the Greek
horama (En.: sight). In order to be able to see into the future, visitors to the fair had to
enter the streamlined building designed by architect Albert Kahn (1869–1942) across
curved ramps, whose esthetic was reminiscent of future superhighways as well as the
above-mentioned utopian path of progress.
Inside awaited 552 plush armchairs mounted on a conveyor. Visitors ﬂoated on it for
16 min over a gigantic 3000 m2 model landscape designed by Bel Geddes. The
seven-million-dollar diorama encompassed half a million houses, a million trees and
50,000 toy cars [25, p. 110; 30, p. 74]. Visitors were provided with a commentary over
loudspeakers about what they could see beneath them: 10,000 animated model cars,
dashing along a fourteen-lane highway, embodied the automatic trafﬁc of tomorrow, kept
in lane by radio waves. Only gas stations were missing, they would have reminded the
visitor of the vision’s dependence on oil. The viewer also sought churches in vain, for the
whole Futurama was already a place of worship, a tribute to a technological promise of
transcendence.
Similarly to Popular Science, Bel Geddes, who had worked in the theater until 1927,
staked all on the primacy of the visual in this production: “One of the best ways to make a
solution understandable to everybody is to make it visual, to dramatize it” (quoted in [50,
p. 24]). The aim was to shape viewers’ desires and underscore industry’s claims to cultural
hegemony over the future. For this, images were needed, not technical designs.
48
F. Kröger
Futurama’s task was not to enlighten viewers, but to allow them into a realm of imagi-
nation. How the public saw the future here was just as important as what it saw. They
imitated “the aviator’s godlike gaze,” shared by modernist planners viewing the chaotic
cities in the hope of controlling them [30, p. 77f]. At the same time, the ideas of Futurama
came along in the era of superheroes (the ﬁrst Superman comic appeared in 1938), whose
earthly ascendency can be read as an allegory of rescue from the Depression. How the
automatic highways were technically supposed to function remained, in contrast to the
highly
developed
pictorial
landscape,
hazy.
This
imbalance
is
typical
of
all
techno-utopias. GM would only disclose that vaguely described “experts” would direct car
drivers when changing lanes from control towers [13, pp. 6, 8]. Clearly, the driver was
supposed to stay at the controls, but simultaneously listen to a human instructor, who
transmitted his orders via radio. Actually, according to James Wetmore, there are no
indications that Bel Geddes’ highways were ever developed beyond the model [50, p. 5].
Nevertheless, Futurama had an enormous cultural impact which is still being felt today.
Two years after the show, science ﬁction author Robert A. Heinlein was already inte-
grating the automated highways made famous in Futurama into his novel Methusala’s
Children (1941) [18, pp. 5, 27; 39, p. 27]. His book made plain the supervision of
automated trafﬁc from control centers.
Beyond this, Heinlein presciently addressed a topic that would crop up in numerous
ﬁlms at the end of the twentieth century: With total road surveillance, a getaway is not
possible in a car. The protagonists in Heinlein’s novel can only turn off the automatic
lanes onto uncontrolled, normal roads by driving through a fence using manual control
[18, p. 27f].
3.8
Estheticizing the Guide-Wire Principle
“Why Don’t We Have… CRASH-PROOF HIGHWAYS”, asked the popular scientiﬁc
magazine Mechanix Illustrated in 1953 [15, pp. 58ff, 184]. The Second World War had
interrupted the dream of automatic driving. The automobile industry concentrated on
military vehicle production in the 1940s. In the post-war period, the utopia of the
driverless automobile sprang back to life. New technologies developed in the war were
now to be used for civilian purposes. The guide-wire principle became more concrete in
technical terms. Automatic driving was supposed to be achieved with magnet detectors as
they had been used in the Second World War to detect landmines. Radar technology—
also a military invention—was to regulate the distance to the car ahead.
With its bird’s-eye panoramic view of a freeway, the illustration accompanying the
article (Fig. 3.4) stunningly resembles the drawing from 1938 mentioned above. The
viewpoint has now dropped down, however, as if the viewer has a sightline from a
building right next to the road. The picture here suggests that automatic driving has moved
closer. The vehicles are now also markedly more detailed, the bodywork drawn somewhat
more futuristically than in the 1938 drawing.

The picture shows automatic driving in a transitional phase between old and new
mobility concepts. The driver has indeed let go of the steering wheel and turned to the rear
passengers, but the front passenger has to strain her arm to be able to speak with her
friends on the back seat. The illustrator was evidently not free to leave out the steering
wheel altogether and turn the front seats around. Moreover, the picture highlights that the
system can be manually overridden to exit the magnetic lane. The public was evidently
not yet ready for a fully automatic vehicle.
3.9
Setting the Family in Self-driving Vehicles
Americas Independent Electric Light and Power Companies [1] placed an ad in LIFE
magazine in 1956 (Fig. 3.5) which to this day gives one of the most detailed and
estheticized depictions of autonomous driving.
In the foreground we see a large sedan rolling along the middle lane of a ribbon of
freeway stretching to the horizon. As well as the central perspective, the further-sunken
viewpoint is very signiﬁcant. While the viewer was given a high and distant perspective in

the above-mentioned illustrations, here we ﬁnd ourselves close behind the car, which
takes on a dramatically real appearance in this vision.
The large glass roof is signiﬁcant, taking up more than half of the picture. It directs our
gaze into the car’s interior. A family of four is sitting around a table, as if the car were a
substitute living room. All family members are portrayed conforming to contemporary
social conventions. The father is in the driver’s seat, although he has abandoned the
steering wheel. Mother and daughter are playing dominos, while the son is looking at his
model airplane. Nobody appears to have his or her seatbelts fastened as the car follows a
dashed line on the hardly-driven route.
This motif shows that pictures of automatic vehicles were ﬁrst and foremost an ideal
stage for setting the harmonious nuclear family. The popular women’s magazine McCalls,
for instance, deﬁned the ideal family in 1954 through being together and sharing common

51
experiences [28, p. 180]. This “family togetherness” quickly evolved into a national ideal.
The 1950s may be termed as a “golden age” for the family, especially visible in the young
age of marriage and low divorce rate. This can be interpreted as a reaction to the times of
war and the Depression, with families forming a counterbalance to the increasingly
anonymized working environment under which personal relationships suffered (ibid.,
p. 177ff). The advertisement derives its attractractiveness from these socio-historical
conditions, by demonstrating a utopian counterpoint to the world of work. In fact, one of
the most important promises of autonomous driving to this day is that of transforming
time spent driving into leisure time spent with the family.
3.10
The Interstate System and the Dream of the Magic
Highway
A decade after the Second World War, the USA went through a time of dramatic changes
with the end of the Korean War. The mass consumer society began to fully blossom. The
expansion of automobilism, an indispensable part of the American lifestyle as far back as
the 1920s, now led to an accelerated transformation of the landscape.
Of prime signiﬁcance was the construction of the supra-regional Interstate Highway
System in 1956. Walt Disney’s ﬁlm Magic Highway U.S.A. (1958) by Ward Kimball
placed this gigantic freeway project in a linear history of progress. In a mix of docu-
mentary archive recordings and ﬁctional cartoon animations, the ﬁlm tells the story of the
American road [43, p. 112f; 48]. The negative consequences of mass motorization—
breakdowns, accidents and jams—are set against the shining ﬁgure of the “highway
engineer.” He will build roads to cure all ills.
This also included automatic driving that was linked, as in the LIFE advertisement, to
the conservative ideal image of the American family (Magic Highway U.S.A., from 39′
00″). The crux of the matter here is a patriarchal society, full employment and con-
sumption. An animated sequence shows a family getting into a futuristic car. After the
father has entered the destination on a console, he holds a business conference call on a
videophone and is afterwards dropped off at the ofﬁce. Mother and son are driven to the
mall.
The promise of automatic driving addressed itself to long car journeys from the suburbs
to the urban centers. Of the 13 million homes built in the USA from 1948 to 1958, 85 %
were in suburbs [28, p. 183]. For families, this meant precisely the opposite of “family
togetherness”. Due to having to commute to work, most fathers had hardly any time left
over for attending to their families (ibid., p. 184). Their wives drove their children to
school, music lessons and the doctor. They lacked social contact, their lives played out in
isolation and boredom. In this respect, the ﬁlm gives a distorted picture of the division of
labor between the sexes, as it omits showing reproductive work.
Magic Highway U.S.A. ends with an automatic vehicle on a centrally framed highway
driving towards a glowing red sunset. We thus again come across the utopian esthetic
52
F. Kröger
running through popular culture since the 1930s. Walt Disney summed up this attitude
with words to the effect that roads connect all nations, “and help create a better under-
standing among the peoples of the world” (Magic Highway U.S.A., 47′05″–47′25″).
Automatic driving would lead, like a “magic carpet to new hopes, new dreams,” right up
to a better life in future. It has seldom been clearer that future technologies are part of a
promise of salvation.
3.11
The Technical Realization of the Guide-Wire Vision and Its
Illustration
So far, we have seen how literature, ﬁlm and print media portrayed the driverless car as
being part of a utopian dream landscape from the 1930s onwards. In the 1950s, these
literary and visual techno-fantasies acquired a new dynamic, as technologies were
developed in the car industry that were supposed to make automatic driving possible.
In 1953, GM started testing a miniature model of the automatic road together with the
electronics manufacturer Radio Company of America (RCA) [50, p. 6]. Autonomous
driving was then popularized in 1956 with the help of the Firebird II concept car as part of
the travelling promotional show Motorama. The accompanying ﬁlm Key to the Future by
Michael Kidd, for instance, shows a family stuck in a trafﬁc jam singing and dreaming of
travelling in a Firebird II, which would get them there so much more comfortably. From a
control tower, a uniformed man directs the car into an automatic express lane. The car
then follows the guide wire and the father can push the control column (Yoke), as seen in
aircraft, into the dashboard. At this time, though, the system did not technically function
[50, p. 7].
On 14 February 1958, the ﬁrst “automatically guided automobile” completed a test
route of one mile at GM’s Technical Center in Warren (Michigan) [14]. The engineers had
ﬁtted the front area of a 1958 Chevrolet with two electronic sensors that followed a wire
laid in the road and adjusted the steering wheel accordingly [24, p. 76]. In this project,
GM drew on the research of the television pioneer Vladimir Zworykin (1888–1982).
Popular science magazines picked up on these experiments with a multi-pronged
pictorial strategy, whose rhetoric distanced itself clearly from the drawings of a techno-
logical utopia. In 1958, for example, Popular Science reported on a test drive at the GM
test track (ibid., pp. 75 ff, 227). The ﬁrst photo shows a young girl laughing as she lets go
of the wheel on an automatic car and puts her hands in the air like a “new human”
(Fig. 3.6).
By using this iconic motif, which references Sperry’s hands-free presentation of
autopilots in June 1914, and to this day crops up again and again in the context of
driverless cars, the photo clearly belongs to the class of the wonderful. The
upward-pointing hands are reminiscent of the orans gesture, with which those at prayer
plea for divine grace.
3
Automated Driving in Its Social, Historical and Cultural Contexts
53
This pictorial relationship to the numinous is brought down to Earth with two pho-
tographs associated with the profane. The ﬁrst shows construction workers laying a guide
wire in a road, the second the picture of a control computer. The photographs are there to
verify self-driving cars’ actual existence, thus distancing themselves from the utopian
pictorial esthetic.
In the same year (1958), GM introduced the Firebird III prototype, which had no
steering wheel. In the central console was a joystick (Unicontrol) that uniﬁed all driving
functions—accelerating, braking, steering. The guide-wire vision was adopted unchanged.
3.12
Cruise Control as a Byproduct of Technological Utopia
In the mid-1950s, real practical applications were added to the utopian visions imagined in
ﬁlm, pictures and words, and the experimental technology systems portrayed in illustra-
tions and photographs.

F. Kröger
Popular Science reported in 1954 on an “Educated Gas Pedal,” the Speed-o-Stat,
developed by Ralph Teetor (1890–1982). This automatic speed regulator and limiter soon
came to enjoy great popularity under the names Tempomat or Cruise Control. The
magazine presented the system as a milestone on the way to automatic driving, setting it
among a larger movement of progress [40, pp. 166ff, 264; 50, p. 34]. But in fact, this
movement was heading in another direction. With the development of the Tempomat, the
car, driven automatically in more reduced and individualized form, detached itself from
the grand vision of automatic highways. The Tempomat thus constituted a model for
driver-assistance systems that automatic driving is now on the point of realizing.
A Popular Science article from 1958 states that Chrysler has developed a new
“supergadget,” an “autopilot” for the price of 86 dollars [41, pp. 105 ff, 248, 250]. There is
no longer any talk of automatic transport, the utopian vision has shrunk and condensed
into a product that is immediately available.
This new logic of immediacy manifests itself in the accompanying photo (Fig. 3.7),
which shows a chrome knob installed alongside the speedometer on the dashboard and
serves to set the speed. Furthermore, we see a hand; thumb and foreﬁnger are in the
process of turning the dial.

Automated Driving in Its Social, Historical and Cultural Contexts

This close-up stands at the end of a long pictorial history that, starting from the initial
distant landscape panoramas, has approached the technological object ever-more closely.
This allows us to identify historically successive pictorial levels, running from the abstract
to the concrete, from the drawing to the photograph, from exterior to interior, from
complete overview to detail, from the collective to the individual.
3.13
Weirdly Bringing the Machine to Life
While press, ﬁlm, and advertising images in the 1950s are still in awe of this vision, and
give the limelight to images of dominant social desires, literature has the question of how
strongly our cars of the future will resemble humans on its mind. It warns of future
technology taking over and gives vent to unconscious fears.
Isaac Asimov’s short story Sally (1953) was published in the same year as the Popular
Science article discussed above. Asimov presents us with humanized “automatomobiles,”
whose positronic motor assures that “there’d never been a human being behind her wheel”
[2]. “You got in, punched your destination and let it go its own way” (ibid., p. 13).
Autonomous driving was only difﬁcult to implement in the beginning, then it abolished all
accidents and “stopped the killing” (ibid.).
The special quality of the story lies in Asimov’s portrayal of the increased anthro-
pomorphism bound up in this vision. The “automatics” are vividly brought to life, they are
described as “hard-working and affectionate” (ibid., p. 15). They “can talk to one another”
(ibid., p. 34). Their emotions can be heard in the sound of the engine (ibid., p. 31). The
convertibles in particular are “very vain” (ibid., p. 16). The automatomobile can also be
switched to “manual” (ibid., p. 19), but one is not allowed to turn the motor off, as this
causes the car pain (ibid., p. 20).
This anthropomorphism then suddenly changes, as in Keller’s short story from 1935,
into something strange and threatening. The cars develop their own will, they stop
opening their doors (ibid., p. 18), roll up to opponents (ibid., p. 25) and ﬁnally begin to
kill: “they found tire marks on his arms and body” (ibid., p. 32). We later ﬁnd the same
pattern again in John Carpenter’s ﬁlm Christine (1981), which is based on a book of
Stephen King.
3.14
The Driverless Automobile in Film
A shift can be seen in the sphere of self-driving cars’ pictorial history at the end of the
1960s. Until that point, popular science magazines had carried the torch in catering for the
public sensation with utopian pictorial concepts. But now cinema took over this role. This
ﬁnally made the driverless car an important element of the entertainment industry, as
James Wetmore conﬁrms [50, p. 26].
56
F. Kröger
In intensity of pictorial language, the cinematic representations of autonomous driving
extend far beyond the print media’s horizons. Their image worlds are not only indicators
of societal hopes, but above all of certain fears. The pattern of weird and wonderful seen
in literature is developed further. In doing so, ﬁlm provides insights into a part of the
collective imagination, into unconscious factors that contribute decisively to new tech-
nology’s acceptance or refusal. Moreover, we see in them the transformation in the
self-driving car’s public perception. The view of various human-machine interfaces is
particularly interesting.
3.15
From Friendly Helpers to Killer Machines
The self-driving car makes its ﬁrst appearance in ﬁlm at the end of the 1960s: Robert
Stevenson’s Herbie, The Love Bug (1968) wowed the public as a friendly, if willful,
helper in Disney’s comedy. The small anthropomorphic racing Beetle has a life of his
own. He moves by himself, falls in love with another car, wants to commit suicide out of
jealousy, careens around drunkenly, shakes with rage, whimpers like a dog, runs a fever.
As Herbie cannot speak, all of his feelings are illustrated by the comments of his
mechanic, who appears to understand him. The self-driving car is shown as a
brought-to-life, mechanical double of man, and serves as a metaphor for the strange,
intense and intimate relationship between people and cars.
Herbie falls into the category of the “purely fantastical,” as deﬁned by Todorov [44],
for the ﬁlm never delivers a mechanical explanation for the car’s behavior. The driverless
car is still completely attributable to the wonderful, as in Illings 1930 novel, and has
nothing weird about it.
This would soon fundamentally change. Two years before the energy crisis of 1973, a
huge tanker truck hunted an unimposing salesman through the mountains of the Cali-
fornian desert in Steven Spielberg’s ﬁrst ﬁlm, Duel. The truck sounds its horn infernally
down the victim’s neck, the rumbling drone of its engine drowns out the radio. All
attempts at escape fail. Although the truck is driven by a human, we never catch sight of
the driver’s face. The machine, with its blank headlights for eyes, thus becomes an actual
hunter.
With Herbie and Duel, two archetypes of the driverless automobile were created which
would go on to be embellished throughout the seventies. Herbie was given three sequels
by 1980. Dudu (1971–1978), the German-Swiss B-movie series, depicts a vehicle with
artiﬁcial intelligence in Ein Käfer auf Extratour (1973), which is said to be where the
American producer Glen A. Larson found inspiration for the Knight Rider series, which
we shall return to later.
Parallel to this, horror ﬁlms exploited the potential threat posed by driverless cars. The
Car (1977) takes Spielberg’s Duel one stage further. A diabolical black sedan terrorizes
the inhabitants of a small town. With darkened windows, close-together, piercing
3
Automated Driving in Its Social, Historical and Cultural Contexts
57
headlights, chrome fenders in the form of a ram’s head, and the motor growling like a
predator, the driverless car becomes a personiﬁcation of evil.
With Christine (1983), the self-driven car reached its horror-movie, anti-Herbie zenith.
John Carpenter’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel describes how the car come-to-life
disposes of its driver. The radio that turns itself on, hints from the beginning that this
Plymouth has a will of its own. The radio is not only a receiver, but mainly a subtle
transmitter, it is the driverless car’s voice and soul. In contrast to The Car, however,
Christine has an owner, the pubescent Arnie, who transforms himself through her, and is
soon practically sexually obsessed by her. In the day, he drives, at night Christine goes
hunting to kill. The windows are darkened like those in The Car. Christine is also
invulnerable like a zombie, being able to heal herself after the worst accidents. The ﬁlm’s
particular appeal lies in the way it remains unclear until the end if it is actually Arnie
driving Christine.
These ﬁlms show the automobile becoming autonomous, which was being reﬂected in
reality. The negative consequences of mass motorization—a high number of vehicle
deaths, ever-longer trafﬁc jams and considerable smog pollution—became fully visible in
the 1970s. The oil crisis of 1973 led, for instance, to stricter emissions rules, and the era of
muscle cars was soon consigned to history. Both in Europe and the USA, this decade
symbolized the end of the golden age of the automobile.
Driverless cars were practically made for allegorical depictions of this trend in the
cinema.
3.16
The Rise of Microelectronics and the Fall
of the Guide-Wire Concept
While the weirdness of self-motion was being conjured up in the cinema, academic and
industrial research began to distance itself from the concept of automatic highways. The
gaps between technical and economic feasibility became too large, explains one of the
engineers involved [50, p. 10]. In addition, the automobile industry had to adjust itself to
stricter environmental regulations and safety standards. This required heavy investment.
There was a trend towards research into autonomous vehicles that are not dependent on
infrastructure such as guide wires. In the 1970s, Japan and the USA made great progress
in attempting to provide cars with sight.
In 1977 Sadayuki Tsugawa’s team from the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in
Tsukuba, Japan, presented the ﬁrst visually guided autonomous vehicle that could record
and process (on-board) pictures of lateral guide rails on the road via two cameras. The car
was able to move with a speed of 10 km/h [46]. It had no function of lane marking
detection.
Hans Moravec from the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Lab at Stanford University in the USA
researched robot navigation from 1973 to 1981, for which he employed the Stanford Cart,
an experimental vehicle with four bicycle tires constructed as far back as 1960. Its original
58
F. Kröger
purpose was to learn how to control a moon rover from Earth. In October 1979, with the
help of the TV camera on-board (not the computers needed), the cart managed to move
through a chair-ﬁlled room without human intervention. “The system was reliable for
short runs, but slow. The cart moved 1 m every 10–15 min, in lurches. After rolling a
meter it stopped, took some pictures, and thought about them for a long time. Then it
planned a new path, executed a little of it, and paused again. It successfully drove the cart
through several 20-m courses (each taking about 5 h) complex enough to necessitate three
or four avoiding swerves; it failed in other trials in revealing ways” [29, p. 407].
At the same time, the rise of microelectronics led, moreover, to increasing use of
electronics in vehicle technology (fuel injection, ignition), through to the launch of the
ﬁrst on-board computer (Check Control) in the 7-series BMW (E23). The era of active
driver-assistance systems that directly intervene in the driving process began with the
introduction of ABS in 1978.
In the 1980s, the research on autonomous vehicles became a serious research topic for
academic and industrial research in many countries. It would exceed the frame of this
article to give a representative picture of all these efforts. Therefore we will concentrate on
the most important pioneering works. Ernst Dickmanns from the University of the Federal
Armed Forces in Munich (Germany) developed for the ﬁrst time visually guided auto-
nomous cars with digital processors onboard, based on the perception of multiple edge
elements. In 1984, his team conceptualized the ﬁrst vehicle that used dynamical models
for visual autonomous guidance: The VaMoRs (Versuchsfahrzeug für autonome Mobilität
und Rechnersehen) was a 5-ton van (Mercedes 508 D), that was able to carry the big sized
computers and cameras of this time. In summer 1987, the VaMoRs drove autonomously
—only with the help of cameras, without radar and GPS—20 km with a speed up to
96 km/h (60 mph). The technology was based on a spatiotemporal dynamic model called
4-D approach, which added to the three dimensions of space the category of time and
integrated a feedback of prediction errors. It was only after this success, that the auto-
motive industry (Daimler-Benz AG) became more seriously interested in the research of
Dickmanns.
The concept of vision-based autonomous driving gained momentum with the
EUREKA-PROgraMme for a European Trafﬁc of Highest Efﬁciency and Unprecedented
Safety (PROMETHEUS) of the European Union (1987–1994). At ﬁrst, the industry had a
preference for lateral guidance of cars using electromagnetic ﬁelds generated by cables in
the road, as known since the 1930s. But the team of Dickmanns successfully convinced
the industry to privilege the concept of machine vision that would allow the detection of
obstacles and avoid additional costs in infrastructure [7]. Today, this can be seen as a
signiﬁcant paradigm shift in the history of the driverless car.
In the context of the PROMETHEUS-Project, the team of Dickmanns then developed
with Mercedes Benz two S-Class (W 140) robotic vehicles: VaMP (UniBw Munich) and
VITA-2 (DBAG) [8, 45, 47]. During the ﬁnal event in October 1994 in France, the
twin-robot vehicles drove more than 1000 km autonomously on three-lane highways
around Paris, in the middle of heavy trafﬁc and with speeds up to 130 km/h. The system
3
Automated Driving in Its Social, Historical and Cultural Contexts
59
was based on real time evaluation of image sequences caught by four cameras. Steering,
throttle and brakes were controlled automatically through computer commands. For “the
ﬁrst time, a machine vision system has been able to demonstrate its capability of deriving
autonomously the decision for lane changing and passing” [9, p. 400]. This system was a
major milestone for autonomous driving and a precursor of modern assistance systems
such as Pre-Safe and Distronic Plus.
In 1995, members of the NavLab of the Carnegie Mellon University in the USA
presented a partially autonomous vehicle that drove from Pittsburgh to San Diego (“No
Hands across America”). They also used a vision-based approach: Steering was based on
camera images of the road. But a human driver had to control brakes and acceleration. In
reaction, the UniBwM decided to demonstrate the capability of its VaMP in a fully
autonomous long distance run from Neubiberg near Munich to Odense in Denmark. The
car drove 95 % (1.678 km) of the trajectory autonomously, with speeds up to 180 km/h
[10, p. 287]. The automated longitudinal and lateral control of the car was based only on
video image processing from the front hemisphere. In the following years, other projects
continued to develop the visual approach: In the context of the ARGO-project, which
followed after Prometheus, the University of Parma in Italy used 1998 a Lancia Thema to
drive 2000 km in Italy only camera based.
The success of all these projects accelerated the shift from automatic lanes to auto-
nomous vehicles.
3.17
Knight Rider and On-board Electronics
These technological developments also inﬂuenced cultural products. Cinema turned its
back on the animistic demonization of driverless cars and began to take an interest in
on-board electronics.
A speaking car by the name of KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) assumed the
lead role in the television series Knight Rider (1982–1986). The black Pontiac Firebird
Trans Am with the red strip of lights in the radiator grill could both be manually controlled
(normal mode) and drive automatically (auto mode). The driving robot supported the
ex-policeman Michael Knight in chasing down criminals.
KITT is thus Fully Automated with Extended Availability Through Driver (see Use
Case Chap. 2). A part of its circuitry was developed at Stanford University, reported
KITT, in an allusion to the development of the driverless Stanford Cart (Knight Rider,
Season one, Episode Just my bill, 24:49).
Knight Rider updates the anthropomorphic dimensions of the Herbie series into the
information society. The series is centered around dialog and communication between
humans and machines. Michael Knight calls up KITT on his wristwatch (ComLink).3
3Knight Rider is said to have been inspired from a computer-aided vehicle in the series B.J. and the
Bear (1979), Episode: Cains Cruiser [19, p. 1].
60
F. Kröger
These images not only dream of autonomous driving, but also of a car we can talk with, a
car that answers. Michael always calls KITT “pal.” The machine is a partner to humans:
Even in manual mode—with a gullwing steering wheel—it gives advice. Language
functions smoothly as a human-machine interface here, in contrast to how it is portrayed
as more problematic in ﬁlms of the 1990s.
Knight Rider also negotiates the axis of the weird and wonderful we are familiar with
from history. In recourse to the stock of images from 1970s horror ﬁlms, KITT duels with
his automobile nemesis KARR, a vehicle programmed for self-preservation.
But the potential to rebel against the driver also lurks in KITT, who does not normally
act on its own accord. For one thing, it can overrule him in exceptional cases, for instance
when his life is put in danger by his driving: “I cannot allow you to jeopardize your life.
I am assuming control” (Knight Rider, Season one, Episode: Trust Doesn’t Rust, 41:53).
We see here that the HAL 9000 computer struggling for autonomy in Stanley Kubrick’s
ﬁlm 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) serves as the model for the conception of KITT
[19, p. 2].
For another, the possibility of a third party reprogramming the vehicle is addressed,
which is then a threat to its owner. These variations on the loss of control also appear in
the current debates surrounding hacker attacks on autonomous vehicles.
3.18
Autonomous Vehicles in Science Fiction Films
In 1990, autonomous vehicles in science ﬁction ﬁlms embarked on a boom that would last
ﬁfteen years. In ambivalent dystopias, cinema showed how man appropriates the beautiful
new world of automatic driving, or how he is driven from it.
In the conﬂict between humans and machines, the central question is: Who is in
control? The possibility of manual override seen in Knight Rider is no longer present in
some of these ﬁlms. Getaway situations in particular became test cases for the degree of
freedom of the automatic vehicle. Another matter addressed is how error-prone the
human-machine interfaces are. It should be stressed that most ﬁlms reﬂect research into
autonomous driving here less than the development of active assistance systems. Three
milestones are relevant at this point: Electronic Stability Program (ESP), which prevents a
vehicle skidding, has been available since 1995; semi-automatic driving became possible
with the introduction of Mercedes’ Distronic system in 1998; and the Dutch manufacturer
TomTom put the ﬁrst mobile navigation device on the market in 2004. This latter
development was of crucial importance in popularizing machine-aided driving, as the
driver then began to get used to obeying directions given by a computer.

The Getaway Car’s Demise in Fully Automated Vehicles
with No Interface
In science ﬁction ﬁlms, we see self-driving cars developed in two different ways. First,
there is a totalitarian version, exhibiting fully autonomous vehicles without any manual
interface.
Paul Verhoeven’s ﬁlm Total Recall (1990) gives the ﬁrst depiction of the getaway-car
crisis in automatic autos of the future. With his pursuers approaching in a manually driven
car, the worker Douglas Quaid, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, tries to escape in an
automatic taxi (Johnny Cab). The android does not understand the order to step on it at
once, however, and instead asks for an address (Total Recall, 00:34:00). As a
human-machine interface, language is more of a hindrance than a help, as the driving
robot cannot simulate the complexity of human communication. Only after ripping out the
mechanical chauffeur from his mounting and controlling the vehicle himself with a joy-
stick does Quaid succeed in getting away.
The surveillance utopia of Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report (2002) paints a con-
siderably more dystopian picture. Here there is no way out, even by vandalizing the
automatic vehicle to take manual control. The ﬁlm shows self-driving vehicles as an
element of a society of control where crimes can be prevented before they happen. When a
police ofﬁcer is himself charged with committing murder in the future, he tries to escape in
an automatic maglev (magnetic levitation) vehicle. But a female voice soon rings out:
“Security lockdown enabled: Revised destination: Ofﬁce.” (Minority Report, 00:41:49).
The car is automatically directed into the opposite lane and drives back to headquarters.
The car has become fully automated (see Chap. 2), the authorities have special rights to
take over the controls. The fugitive is as good as caught. The only option for him is to
leave the car by jumping out of the window.
This sequence shows one of the essential reservations regarding autonomous driving.
One of the cultural attractions of the car historically lay in the suggestion of an identity
with a self. Here, the vehicle slips not only the control of this self, it becomes a real trap
because it can be remotely controlled from outside. It thus represents exactly the opposite
of the anthropologically dominant, unconscious desire for escape that the automobile
historically promised to fulﬁll.
3.20
Selecting the Control Mode by Voice or the Touch
of a Button
A second group of ﬁlms shows a “more democratic” version of automatic driving—the
driver can choose between automatic and manual control via a human-machine interface.
In Marco Brambilla’s futuristic thriller Demolition Man (1993), autonomous driving is
part of a perfect world with no dangers, in which swear words, meat, chocolate, corporeal
sex, petrol and spicy food have been outlawed. The ﬁlm shows a futuristic police car that
62
F. Kröger
can be controlled both manually and automatically. At the spoken command “self-drive
on!” the car answers with a female voice and the steering wheel unfolds (Demolition Man
12:42).
As in Total Recall, language’s suitability as an interface is here deemed unreliable. The
on-board computer signals a software error, and switching to self-drive mode is suddenly
no longer possible. The car speeds into a bend and even screaming “brake!” cannot
prevent the accident, as the vehicle has stopped responding (Demolition Man, 01:30:20).
In this sequence, cinema reminds us how every new technology brings with it new types
of accidents.
Two further ﬁlms stress that we can only escape if the autonomous vehicle can be
switched to manual control. Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element (1997) tells the story of taxi
driver Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), who lives in a fully automated apartment and has a
ﬂying taxicab. As in many ﬁlms, automation is here equated with total surveillance.
At the same time, the ﬁlm portrays physically pressing buttons as guaranteeing a last
modicum of freedom. In order to evade a police check, Dallas deactivates his taxi’s
automatic mode (The Fifth Element, 34:20). He does this by pressing a button, not by
voice command.
The whole setting of Alex Proyas’ ﬁlm I, Robot (2004) is predicated on ambivalence
towards the weirdness and wonder of modern machines. Commissioner Spooner (Will
Smith) has a fully automated Audi RSQ that can also be manually controlled. The steering
wheel, open on top with joysticks on the side, is extendable like that in the Firebird II. It is
button-activated.
Although the vehicle is driving through a tunnel at high speed, Spooner suddenly
decides to take the controls himself (Fig. 9). “Manual driving,” conﬁrms the car with a
female voice (I, Robot 21:23). His passenger, appalled, asks if he really wants to drive
manually. Shortly afterwards they almost have an accident. At high speed, then, automatic
control is safer than manual. What is meant by safety, however, depends on the context. In
order to be able to reach safety in the face of attackers, the car must be driven manually (I,
Robot, 50:46). Again we can ﬁnd the contradiction between autonomous driving and the
getaway car.
I, Robot is the most recent ﬁlm to date depicting autonomous driving. This may be seen
in the context of the US military’s robot races, which started in the same year. With the
aim of having one third of American military vehicles drive autonomously in future, the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) held the ﬁrst Grand Challenge in
2004, a desert race of autonomous vehicles. A VW Touareg named Stanley emerged as
the winner of the second race in 2005. It had been developed at the Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Laboratory at Stanford University under the supervision of Sebastian Thrun, who estab-
lished the well-known ﬂeet of autonomous vehicles at Google in 2008.

Automated Driving in Its Social, Historical and Cultural Contexts
63
The driverless car had thus arrived in reality. For a long time, research inspired ﬁlm;
now it appears to be the other way around. Film serves as a reference for research teams:
one of the participants in the 2007 Urban Challenge was a vehicle from the Team
University of Central Florida that went by the name Knight Rider.
3.21
Why Remote Control is Less Scary?
We ﬁnish near where we started, with remote control, which is portrayed in ﬁlm as the
least problematic solution. Batman (1989) summons his vehicle via a radio device
(Batman 01:08:55), James Bond controls his car in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) via a
touchpad on an early smartphone (Tomorrow Never Dies, 51:24, 57:26).
Neither car is really driverless, the driver is merely outside the vehicle. The driver
workspace is delocalized, but control is not fully handed over to the machine. For this
reason, both cars are good as getaway vehicles. To be driven by a car is evidently
incompatible with the status of a superhero. Physical contact with a material object to
control—here the remote control—guarantees that the driver-subject’s bargaining power
is preserved.
3.22
Outlook
This look into automatic driving’s pictorial and technological history has shown that
innovations in technology and iconographic imagery have evolved in mutual interplay.
Technological prototypes, literary metaphors and pictorial imaginings spark off each
other, but never evolve in step.
Remote control technology brought the ﬁrst remote-controlled car onto the streets. The
ﬁrst truly autonomous vehicle emerged, however, in the literary imagination. From 1935–
1955, the history of images is one step ahead of that of technology, and stimulates with its
utopian highway panoramas. At the end of the 1960s, a strand of ﬁlm history evolves that
is relatively autonomous of technological development, but which then, from the 1980s
onwards, directly comments on the increased use of electronics in driving. From 2005 on,
autonomous driving appears to become cinematically unattractive as it approaches the
threshold of the present.
For the entire time, the cultural logic of the self-driving automobile develops in the
space between the weird and the wonderful.
We are concluding—to venture an overview—by returning to the opposition between
driver-controlled and self-driving vehicles. The transition from a culture centered on
driving ourselves around, to one of allowing ourselves to be driven, represents a huge
challenge. How does Sheer Driving Pleasure (BMW) turn into the pleasure of Being
Driven?
64
F. Kröger
The automobile’s automation is not comparable with the automation of other objects
from twentieth century industrial culture. One important effect of automation is relieving
physically strenuous activities (escalators, elevators, washing machines). Even if these
technical transformations required a shift in perception, the logic of the activity affected
was not diametrically reversed.
Steering a car, on the other hand, is not only a laborious, boring, tiring and dangerous
activity. Driving is also fun. It is precisely its risk and danger that has been driving’s
central appeal for drivers old and new. The transition to driverless automobiles therefore
represents a cultural leap; it practically necessitates a reinvention of the car. It is worth
remembering that, etymologically and historically, the term automobile combines the
Greek autos (self) and the Latin mobilis (moveable). To be auto-mobile therefore means to
be able to move oneself, to be self-mobile. Whether self here means that of the driver, or
the car’s, thus essentially remains an open question. It may therefore be said with some
justice that the auto only truly becomes automobile with the advent of autonomous
driving.
3.22.1 Is Siri Paving the Way for Iris?
The success of future autonomous vehicles depends on a key element: the human-machine
interface. Around the turn of the century, cinema assessed linguistic communication
between man and machine with some skepticism. Acoustic exchanges were portrayed as
more prone to breaking down and more open for ambiguities than haptic contact.
Disposing of the steering wheel continues to be a taboo. It may be the case, however,
that SIRI, the speech recognition software introduced into smartphones in 2011, is paving
the way for linguistic interfaces in cars. A recently published study [49] made it clear that
autonomous vehicles are met with greater trust if they are given a name, voice and gender.
The car was given the name IRIS and a female voice that told the user how the vehicle
worked.
On the one hand, driverless cars break with all the historical rituals associated with
control; on the other, they are practically predestined to render automobiles ever-more
anthropomorphized. Today, we already treat our cars as living beings, and ﬁnd nothing
strange about it, to paraphrase Sigmund Freud’s remarks on children playing with dolls
[12]. This bringing-to-life need not play out only in the weirdness of cinema, then, but
may also be compatible with the wonderful. A tamed yet brought-to-life car could even
reclaim something of the fairy tale [3] that the automobile lost in the course of mass
motorization.

Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars
Patrick Lin
If motor vehicles are to be truly autonomous and able to operate responsibly on our roads,
they will need to replicate—or do better than—the human decision-making process. But
some decisions are more than just a mechanical application of trafﬁc laws and plotting a
safe path. They seem to require a sense of ethics, and this is a notoriously difﬁcult
capability to reduce into algorithms for a computer to follow.
This chapter will explain why ethics matters for autonomous road vehicles, looking at
the most urgent area of their programming. Nearly all of this work is still in front of the
industry, which is to say that I will mainly raise the questions here and not presume to
have any deﬁnitive answers at such an early stage of the technology.
A brief note about terminology
I will use “autonomous”, “self driving”, “driverless”, and “robot” interchangeably.
These refer primarily to future vehicles that may have the ability to operate without human
intervention for extended periods of time and to perform a broad range of actions. I will
also use “cars” to refer loosely to all motor vehicles, from a motorcycle to a freight truck;
those distinctions do not matter for the discussion here.
4.1
Why Ethics Matters
To start, let me offer a simple scenario that illustrates the need for ethics in autonomous
cars. Imagine in some distant future, your autonomous car encounters this terrible choice:
it must either swerve left and strike an eight-year old girl, or swerve right and strike an
80-year old grandmother [33]. Given the car’s velocity, either victim would surely be

killed on impact. If you do not swerve, both victims will be struck and killed; so there is
good reason to think that you ought to swerve one way or another. But what would be the
ethically correct decision? If you were programming the self-driving car, how would you
instruct it to behave if it ever encountered such a case, as rare as it may be?
Striking the grandmother could be the lesser evil, at least to some eyes. The thinking is
that the girl still has her entire life in front of her—a ﬁrst love, a family of her own, a
career, and other adventures and happiness—while the grandmother has already had a full
life and her fair share of experiences. Further, the little girl is a moral innocent, more so
than just about any adult. We might agree that the grandmother has a right to life and as
valuable a life as the little girl’s; but nevertheless, there are reasons that seem to weigh in
favor of saving the little girl over the grandmother, if an accident is unavoidable. Even the
grandmother may insist on her own sacriﬁce, if she were given the chance to choose.
But either choice is ethically incorrect, at least according to the relevant professional
codes of ethics. Among its many pledges, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), for instance, commits itself and its 430,000+ members “to treat fairly
all persons and to not engage in acts of discrimination based on race, religion, gender,
disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression”
[23]. Therefore, to treat individuals differently on the basis of their age, when age is not a
relevant factor, seems to be exactly the kind of discrimination the IEEE prohibits [18, 33].
Age does not appear to be a relevant factor in our scenario as it might be in, say,
casting a young actor to play a child’s character in a movie. In that movie scenario, it
would be appropriate to reject adult actors for the role. Anyway, a reason to discriminate
does not necessarily justify that discrimination, since some reasons may be illegitimate.
Even if we point to the disparity of life experiences between the old and the young, that
difference isn’t automatically an appropriate basis for different treatment.
Discriminating on the basis of age in our crash scenario would seem to be the same evil
as discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender, disability, national origin, and so
on, even if we can invent reasons to prefer one such group over another. In Germany—
home to many inﬂuential automotive companies that are working to develop self-driving
technologies—the right to life and human dignity is basic and set forth in the ﬁrst two
articles of the very ﬁrst chapter in the nation’s constitution [9]. So it is difﬁcult to see how
German law could even allow a company to create a product that is capable to making such
a horriﬁc and apparently illegal choice. The United States similarly strives to offer equal
protection to all persons, such as stipulated in the fourteenth amendment of its constitution.
If we cannot ethically choose a path forward, then what ought to be done? One solution
is to refuse to make a swerve decision, allowing both victims to be struck; but this seems
much worse than having only one victim die, even if we are prejudiced against her.
Anyway, we can force a decision by modifying the scenario: assume that 10 or 100 other
pedestrians would die, if the car continued forward; and swerving would again result in
only a single death.
Another solution could be to arbitrarily and unpredictably choose a path, without
prejudice to either person [34]. But this too seems ethically troubling, in that we are
70
P. Lin
choosing between lives without any deliberation at all—to leave it to chance, when there
are potentially some reasons to prefer one over the other, as distasteful and uncomfortable
as those reasons may be. This is a dilemma that is not easily solvable and therefore points
to a need for ethics in developing autonomous cars.
4.1.1
Beyond Crash-Avoidance
Many readers may object right away that the dilemma above, as well as others that follow,
will never occur with autonomous cars. It may be suggested that future cars need not
confront hard ethical choices, that simply stopping the car or handing control back to the
human operator is the easy path around ethics. But I will contend here that braking and
relinquishing control will not always be enough. Those solutions may be the best we have
today, but if automated cars are to ever operate more broadly outside of limited highway
environments, they will need more response-options.
Current research already makes this case as a matter of physics [12, 13], but we can
also make a case from commonsense. Many ordinary scenarios exist today in which
braking is not the best or safest move, whether by human or self-driving car. A wet road or
a tailgater, for instance, may make it dangerous to slam the brakes, as opposed to some
other action such as steering around the obstacle or simply through it, if it is a small
object. Today, the most advanced self-driving cars cannot detect small objects such as
squirrels [7]; therefore, they presumably cannot also detect squirrel-sized rocks, potholes,
kittens, and other small but consequential hazards can cause equipment failure, such as tire
blowouts or sensor errors, or deviations from a safe path.
In these and many other cases, there may not be enough time to hand control back to the
driver. Some simulation experiments suggest that human drivers need up to 40 s to
regain situation awareness, depending on the distracting activity, e.g., reading or napping—
far longer than the 1–2 s of reaction time required for typical accident scenarios [18, 38].
This means that the car must be responsible for making decisions when it is unreasonable to
expect a timely transfer of control back to the human, and again braking might not be the
most responsible action.
One possible reply is that, while imperfect, braking could successfully avoid the
majority of emergency situations a robot car may ﬁnd itself it, even if it regrettably makes
things worse in a small number of cases. The beneﬁts far outweigh the risks, presumably,
and the numbers speak for themselves. Or do they? I will discuss the dangers of morality
by math throughout this chapter.
Braking and other responses in the service of crash-avoidance won’t be enough,
because crash-avoidance is not enough. Some accidents are unavoidable—such as when
an animal or pedestrian darts out in front of your moving car—and therefore autonomous
cars will need to engage in crash-optimization as well. Optimizing crashes means to
choose the course of action that will likely lead to the least amount of harm, and this could
4
Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars
71
mean a forced choice between two evils, for instance, choosing to strike either the
eight-year old girl or the 80-year old grandmother in my ﬁrst scenario above.
4.1.2
Crash-Optimization Means Targeting
There may be reasons, by the way, to prefer choosing to run over the eight-year old girl
that I have not yet mentioned. If the autonomous car were most interested in protecting its
own occupants, then it would make sense to choose a collision with the lightest object
possible (the girl). If the choice were between two vehicles, then the car should be
programmed to prefer striking a lighter vehicle (such as a Mini Cooper or motorcycle)
than a heavier one (such as a sports utility vehicle (SUV) or truck) in an adjacent lane
[18, 34].
On the other hand, if the car were charged with protecting other drivers and pedestrians
over its own occupants—not an unreasonable imperative—then it should be programmed
to prefer a collision with the heavier vehicle than the lighter one. If vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are rolled out (or V2X to refer
to both), or if an autonomous car can identify the speciﬁc models of other cars on the road,
then it seems to make sense to collide with a safer vehicle (such as a Volvo SUV that has a
reputation for safety) over a car not known for crash-safety (such as a Ford Pinto that’s
prone to exploding upon impact).
This strategy may be both legally and ethically better than the previous one of jealously
protecting the car’s own occupants. It could minimize lawsuits, because any injury to
others would be less severe. Also, because the driver is the one who introduced the risk to
society—operating an autonomous vehicle on public roads—the driver may be legally
obligated, or at least morally obligated, to absorb the brunt of any harm, at least when
squared off against pedestrians, bicycles, and perhaps lighter vehicles.
The ethical point here, however, is that no matter which strategy is adopted by an
original equipment manufacturer (OEM), i.e., auto manufacturer, programming a car to
choose a collision with any particular kind of object over another very much resembles a
targeting algorithm [33]. Somewhat related to the military sense of selecting targets,
crash-optimization algorithms may involve the deliberate and systematic discrimination
of, say, large vehicles or Volvos to collide into. The owners or operators of these targeted
vehicles bear this burden through no fault of their own, other than perhaps that they care
about safety or need an SUV to transport a large family.
4.1.3
Beyond Harm
The problem is starkly highlighted by the following scenario [15–17, 34]: Again, imagine
that an autonomous car is facing an imminent crash, but it could select one of two targets
in adjacent lanes to swerve into: either a motorcyclist who is wearing a helmet, or a
motorcyclist who is not. It probably doesn’t matter much to the safety of the car itself or
72
P. Lin
its occupants whether the motorcyclist is wearing a helmet; the impact of a helmet into a
car window doesn’t introduce that much more risk that the autonomous car should want to
avoid it over anything else. But it matters a lot to the motorcyclist whether s/he is wearing
a helmet: the one without a helmet would probably not survive such a collision. Therefore,
in this dreadful scenario, it seems reasonable to program a good autonomous car to swerve
into the motorcyclist with the helmet.
But how well is justice and public policy served by this crash-optimization design?
Motorcyclists who wear helmets are essentially being penalized and discriminated against
for their responsible decision to wear a helmet. This may encourage some motorcyclists to
not wear helmets, in order to avoid targeting by autonomous cars. Likewise, in the
previous scenario, sales may decline for automotive brands known for safety, such as
Volvo and Mercedes Benz, insofar as customers want to avoid being the preferred targets
of crash-optimization systems.
Some readers may want to argue that the motorcyclist without a helmet ought to be
targeted, for instance, because he has acted recklessly and therefore is more deserving of
harm. Even if that’s the correct design, notice that we are again moving beyond harm in
making crash-optimization decisions. We’re still talking about justice and other such
ethical considerations, and that’s the point: it’s not just a numbers game.
Programmers in such scenarios, as rare as they may be, would need to design
cost-functions—algorithms that assign and calculate the expected costs of various possible
options, selecting the one with the lowest costs—that potentially determine who gets to
live and who gets to die. And this is fundamentally an ethics problem, one that demands
much more care and transparency in reasoning than seems currently offered. Indeed, it is
difﬁcult to imagine a weightier and more profoundly serious decision a programmer
would ever have to make. Yet, there is little discussion about this core issue to date.
4.2
Scenarios that Implicate Ethics
In addition to the ones posited above, there are many actual and hypothetical scenarios
that involve judgments about ethics. I will describe some here to show how ordinary
assumptions in ethics can be challenged.
4.2.1
The Deer
Though difﬁcult to quantify due to inconsistent and under-reporting, experts estimate that
more than a million car accidents per year in the US are caused by deer [6, 48]. Many, if
not most, drivers have been startled by an unexpected animal on the road, a dangerous
situation for both parties. Deconstructing a typical accident, or near-accident, involving an
animal illustrates the complexity of the decisions facing the driver [30]. While all this
happens within seconds—not enough time for careful deliberations by human drivers—an
4
Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars
73
autonomous car could have the virtue of a (presumably) thoughtful decision-making script
to very quickly react in an optimal way. If it is able to account for the many variables, then
it ought to, for the most informed decision possible.
First, suppose an object appears on the road directly in front of a car in autonomous
mode. Is there time to reasonably hand control back to the human behind the wheel?
(Probably not.) If not, is there time to stop the car? Would the car need to brake hard, or
would moderate braking be sufﬁcient? The decision to brake depends, again, on road
conditions and whether a tailgater (such as a big-rig truck) is behind you, including its
speed to determine the severity of a possible rear-end collision.
Second, what is the object? Is it an animal, a person, or something else? If it is an
animal, are some animals permissible to run over? It may be safer to continue ahead and
strike a squirrel, for instance, than to violently swerve around it and risk losing control of
the car. However, larger animals, such as deer and cows, are more likely to cause serious
damage to the car and injuries to occupants than a spun-out car. Other animals, still, have
special places in our hearts and should be avoided if possible, such as pet dogs and cats.
Third, if the car should get out of the way—either in conjunction with braking or not—
should it swerve to the left or to the right? In the US and other nations in which drivers
must stay on the right side of the road, turning to the right may mean driving off the road,
potentially into a ditch or a tree. Not only could harm to the car and occupants be likely,
but it also matters how many occupants are in the car. The decision to drive into an
embankment seems different when only one adult driver is in the car, than when several
children are inside too.
On the other hand, turning to the left may mean driving into an opposite lane, potentially
into a head-on collision with incoming vehicles. If such a collision is unavoidable, then it
matters what kind of vehicle we would crash into (e.g., is it a compact car or SUV?), how
heavy incoming trafﬁc is (e.g., would more than one vehicle be involved?), how many
persons may be involved (e.g., are there children in the other car?). Of course, here we are
assuming perfect sensing and V2X communications that can help answer these questions.
If we cannot answer the questions, then we face a possibly large unknown risk, which
makes driving into incoming trafﬁc perhaps the worst option available.
Other factors relevant to the decision-points above include: the road-shoulder type
(paved, gravel, none, etc.), the condition of the car’s tires and brakes, whether the car’s
occupants are seat-belted, whether the car is transporting dangerous cargo that could spill
or explode, proximity to hospital or emergency rescue, damage to property such as houses
and buildings, and more. These variables inﬂuence the probability of an accident as well
as expected harm, both of which are needed in selecting the best course of action.
From this short analysis of a typical crash (or possible crash) with an animal, we can
already see a daunting number of factors to account for. Sensing technologies today
cannot answer some or many of the questions above, but it is already unclear that braking
should be the safest default option—as a proxy for the most ethical option—given these
uncertain conditions, all things considered. Automated cars today can already detect
whether there is oncoming trafﬁc in the opposite lane. Therefore, it is at least possible that
74
P. Lin
they can be programmed to maneuver slightly into the incoming lane under some con-
ditions, e.g., when there are no incoming cars and when it may be dangerous to slam on
the brakes.
Whether or not sensing technologies will improve enough to deliver answers to our
questions above, a programmer or OEM would still need to assign costs or weights to
various actions and objects as best as they can. Yet these values are not intrinsic to or
discoverable by science or engineering. Values are something that we humans must
stipulate and ideally agree upon. In constructing algorithms to control an autonomous car,
ethics is already implied in the design process. Any decision that involves a tradeoff such
as to strike object x instead of object y requires a value-judgment about the wisdom of the
tradeoff, that is, the relative weights of x and y. And the design process can be made better
by recognizing the ethical implications and by engaging the broader community to ensure
that those values are represented correctly or at least transparently. Working in a moral
bubble is less likely to deliver results that are acceptable to society.
Again, in a real-world accident today, a human driver usually has neither the time nor
the information needed to make the most ethical or least harmful decisions. A person who
is startled by a small animal on an otherwise-uneventful drive may very well react poorly.
He might drive into oncoming trafﬁc and kill a family, or oversteer into a ditch and to his
own death. Neither of these results, however, is likely to lead to criminal prosecution by
themselves, since there was no forethought, malice, negligence, or bad intent in making a
forced, split-second reaction. But the programmer and OEM do not operate under the
sanctuary of reasonable instincts; they make potentially life-and-death decisions under no
truly urgent time-constraint and therefore incur the responsibility of making better
decisions than human drivers reacting reﬂexively in surprise situations.
4.2.2
Self-sacrifice
As we can see, real-world accidents can be very complicated. In philosophy and ethics, a
familiar method is to simplify the issues through hypothetical scenarios, otherwise known
as “thought-experiments.” This is similar to everyday science experiments in which
researchers create unusual conditions to isolate and test desired variables, such as sending
spiders into outer space to see how micro-gravity affects their ability to spin webs. It is not
a good objection to those experiments to say that no spiders exist naturally in space; that
misses the point of the experiment.
Likewise, it is no objection to our hypothetical examples that they are outlandish and
unlikely to happen in the real world, such as a car that can distinguish an eight-year old
from an 80-year old (though with improving biometrics, facial recognition technologies,
and linked databases, this doesn’t seem impossible). Our thought-experiments are still
useful in drawing out certain ethical intuitions and principles we want to test.
With that understanding, we can devise hypothetical scenarios to see that reasonable
ethical principles can lead to controversial results in the context of autonomous driving.
4
Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars
75
Digging into a standard philosophical toolbox for help with ethical dilemmas, one of the
ﬁrst principles we might reach for is consequentialism: that the right thing to do is
whatever leads to the best results, especially in quantiﬁed terms [44]. As it applies here,
consequentialism suggests that we should strive to minimize harm and maximize whatever
it is that matters, such as, the number of happy lives.
In this thought-experiment, your future autonomous car is driving you on a narrow
road, alongside a cliff. No one and no technology could foresee that a school bus with 28
children would appear around the corner, partially in your lane [29, 36]. Your car cal-
culates that crash is imminent; given the velocities and distance, there is no possible action
that can avoid harming you. What should your robot car do?
A good, standard-issue consequentialist would want to optimize results, that is, max-
imize the number of happy lives and minimize harm. Assuming that all lives in this
scenario are more or less equally happy—for instance, there’s no super-happy or
super-depressed person, and no very important person who has unusual inﬂuence over the
welfare of others—they would each count for about the same in our moral calculation. As
you like, we may either ignore or account for the issue of whether there is extra value in
the life of innocent child who has more years of happiness ahead of her than an average
adult; that doesn’t matter much for this scenario.
The robot car’s two main choices seem to be: (1) to slam on the brakes and crash into
the bus, risking everyone’s lives, or (2) to drive off the cliff, sparing the lives of everyone
on the bus. Performing a quick expected-utility calculation, if the odds of death to each
person (including the adult bus driver) in the accident averaged more than one in 30, then
colliding into the bus would yield the expected result of more than one death, up to all 30
persons. (Let’s say the actual odds are one in three, which gives an expected result of 10
deaths.) If driving off a cliff meant certain death, or the odds of one in one, then the
expected result of that would be exactly one death (your own) and no more. The right
consequentialist decision for the robot car—if all we care about is maximizing lives and
minimizing deaths—is apparently to drive off the cliff and sacriﬁce the driver, since it is
better that only one person should die rather than more than one, especially 10 or all 30
persons.
This decision would likely be different if, instead of a school bus, your robot car were
about to collide with another passenger car carrying ﬁve persons. Given the same average
odds of death, one in 10, the expected number of deaths in a collision would only be 0.6,
while the expected number of deaths in driving off a cliff remains at one. In that case, the right
consequentialist decision would be to allow the accident to occur, as long as the average odds
of death are less than one in six. If, instead of another vehicle, your car were about to collide
with a deer, then the decision to stay on the road, despite an ensuing accident, would be even
more obvious insofar as we value a deer’s life less than a human life.
Back to the school-bus scenario, programming an autonomous car with a conse-
quentialist framework for ethics would seem to imply your sacriﬁce. But what is most
striking about this case might not even be your death or the moral mathematics: if you
were in a manually driven car today, driving off the cliff might still be the most ethical
76
P. Lin
choice you could make, so perhaps you would choose certain death anyway, had you the
time to consider the options. However, it is one thing for you to willingly make that
decision of sacriﬁce yourself, and quite another matter for a machine to make that decision
without your consent or foreknowledge that self-sacriﬁce was even a possibility. That is,
there is an astonishing lack of transparency and therefore consent in such a grave decision,
one of the most important that can be made about one’s life—perhaps noble if voluntary,
but criminal if not.
Thus, reasonable ethical principles—e.g., aiming to save the greatest number of lives—
can be stressed in the context of autonomous driving. An operator of an autonomous
vehicle, rightly or not, may very well value his own life over that of everyone else’s, even
that of 29 others; or he may even explicitly reject consequentialism. Even if conse-
quentialism is the best ethical theory and the car’s moral calculations are correct, the
problem may not be with the ethics but with a lack of discussion about ethics. Industry,
therefore, may do well to have such a discussion and set expectations with the public.
Users—and news headlines—may likely be more forgiving if it is explained in advance
that self-sacriﬁce may be a justiﬁed feature, not a bug.
4.2.3
Ducking Harm
Other ethical principles can create dilemmas, too. It is generally uncontroversial that, if
you can easily avoid harm to yourself, then you should do it. Indeed, it may be morally
required that you save yourself when possible, if your life is intrinsically valuable or worth
protecting; and it is at least extrinsically valuable if you had a dependent family. Auto
manufacturers or OEMs seem to take this principle for granted as well: if an autonomous
car can easily avoid a crash, e.g., by braking or swerving, then it should. No ethical
problem here—or is there?
In another thought-experiment [15, 18, 33], your robotic car is stopped at an inter-
section and waits patiently for the children who are crossing in front of you. Your car
detects a pickup truck coming up behind you, about to cause a rear-end collision with you.
The crash would likely damage your car to some degree and perhaps cause minor injury to
you, such as whiplash, but certainly not death. To avoid this harm, your car is pro-
grammed to dash out of the way, if it can do so safely. In this case, your car can easily turn
right at the intersection and avoid the rear-end collision. It follows this programming, but
in doing so, it clears a path for the truck to continue through the intersection, killing a
couple children and seriously injuring others.
Was this the correct way to program an autonomous car? In most cases of an
impending rear-end collision, probably yes. But in this particular case, the design decision
meant saving you from minor injury at the expense of serious injury and death of several
children, and this hardly seems to be the right choice. In an important respect, you (or the
car) are responsible for their deaths: you (or the car) killed the children by removing an
obstruction that prevented harm from falling upon them, just as you would be responsible
4
Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars
77
for a person’s death if you removed a shield he was holding in front of a stream of gunﬁre.
And killing innocent people has legal and moral ramiﬁcations.
As with the self-sacriﬁce scenario above, it might be that in the same situation today, in
a human-driven car, you would make the same decision to save yourself from injury, if
you were to see a fast-approaching vehicle about to slam into you. That is, the result might
not change if a human made the on-the-spot decision. But, again, it is one thing to make
such a judgment in the panic of the moment, but another less forgivable thing for a
programmer—far removed from the scene and a year or more in advance—to create a
cost-function that resulted in these deaths. Either the programmer did so deliberately, or
she did it unintentionally, unaware that this was a possibility. If the former, then this could
be construed as premeditated homicide; and if the latter, gross negligence.
Either way is very bad for the programmer and perhaps an inherent risk in the business,
when one attempts to replicate human decision-making in a broad range of dynamic
scenarios. Sometimes, an autonomous car may be faced with a “no-win” scenario, putting
the programmer in a difﬁcult but all too real position. To mitigate this risk, industry may
do well to set expectations not only with users but also with broader society, educating
them that they could also become victims even if not operating or in a robot car, and that
perhaps this is justiﬁed by a greater public or overall good.
4.2.4
Trolley Problems
One of the most iconic thought-experiments in ethics is the trolley problem [4, 8, 11, 47],
and this is one that may now occur in the real world, if autonomous vehicles come to be.
Indeed, driverless trains are already operating in dozens of cities worldwide and could
bring this scene to life [24]. The classical dilemma involves a runaway trolley (or train)
that is about to run over and kill ﬁve unaware people standing on the tracks. Looking at
the scene from the outside, you ﬁnd yourself standing next to a switch: if you pull the
switch, you can shunt the train to a right-hand set of tracks, thereby saving the ﬁve
individuals on the track. Unfortunately, there is one person standing on the right-hand set
of tracks who would then be killed. What is the right decision?
The “correct” decision continues to be a subject of much debate in philosophy. Both
answers seem reasonable and defensible. A consequentialist might justify switching the
tracks to save ﬁve people, even at the regrettable expense of one. But a non-consequentialist,
someone who considers more than just the math or results, might object on the grounds that
switching tracks constitutes an act of killing (the one person), while doing nothing is merely
allowing someone to die (the ﬁve individuals); and that it is morally and legally worse to kill
than to let die.
Killing implies that you are directly responsible for a person’s death: had you not done
what you did, the person would have lived. Letting die, however, involves much less
responsibility on your part, if any, since some causal process was already underway that
was not initiated or otherwise controlled by you. The question of whether it is worse to kill
78
P. Lin
than to let die is also subject to debate in philosophy. But let us bracket that for the
moment, as a ﬁnal answer is not necessary for our discussion, only that it is reasonable to
believe that proposition.
Adapting the trolley problem to the technology at hand, let us suppose that you are
driving an autonomous car in manual mode; you are in control. Either intentionally or not
—you could be homicidal or simply inattentive—you are about to run over and kill ﬁve
pedestrians. Your car’s crash-avoidance system detects the possible accident and
activates, forcibly taking control of the car from your hands. To avoid this disaster, it
swerves in the only direction it can, let’s say to the right. But on the right is a single
pedestrian who is unfortunately killed.
Was this the right decision for your car to make? Again, a consequentialist would say
yes: it is better that only one person dies than ﬁve. But a non-consequentialist might
appeal to a moral distinction between killing and letting die, and this matters to OEMs for
liability reasons. If the car does not wrestle control from the human driver, then it (and the
OEM) would perhaps not be responsible for the deaths of the ﬁve pedestrians while you
were driving the car; it is merely letting those victims die. But if the car does take control
and make a decision that results in the death of a person, then it (and the OEM) becomes
responsible for killing a person.
As with the trolley problem, either choice seems defensible. Results do matter, so it is
not ridiculous to think that the car should be programmed to act and save lives, even at the
expense of a fewer number of lives. Yet it also seems reasonable to think that killing is
worse than letting die, especially in the eyes of the law. What I want to highlight here is
not so much the answer but the process of deliberation that points us toward one answer
over another. To the extent that there could be many acceptable answers to any given
ethical dilemma, how well one answer can be defended is crucial toward supporting that
answer over others.
Industry again would do well to set expectations by debating and explaining in advance
its reasoning behind key algorithms that could result in life or death. Transparency, or
showing one’s math, is an important part of doing ethics, not just the answer itself.
4.3
Next Steps
Notice that the ethical issues discussed in this paper do not depend on technology errors,
poor maintenance, improper servicing, security vulnerabilities, or other failings—and all
those will occur too. No complex technology we have created has been infallible. Even
industries with money directly at stake have not solved this problem. For instance, bank
ATMs continue to make headlines when they hemorrhage cash—tens of thousands of
dollars more than the account holder actually has—because of software glitches alone
[2, 10], never mind hacking. And just about every computing device we have created has
been hacked or is hackable, including neural implants and military systems [3, 28].
4
Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars
79
These vulnerabilities and errors certainly can cause harm in the context of autonomous
cars, and it would be unethically irresponsible to safeguard against them where we can.
Putting these technology issues aside and even assuming that perfect technology is
available, there are still many other safety and ethical questions to worry about, such as
the programming issues above.
4.3.1
Broader Ethical Issues
But programming is only one of many areas to reﬂect upon as society begins to adopt
autonomous driving technologies. Assigning legal and moral responsibility for crashes is a
popular topic already [1, 14, 20, 22, 49, 51]. Here are a few others, as part of a much
longer list of possible questions:
Does it matter to ethics if a car is publicly owned, for instance, a city bus or ﬁre truck?
The owner of a robot car may reasonably expect that its property “owes allegiance” to the
owner and should value his or her life more than anonymous pedestrians and drivers. But
a publicly owned automated vehicle might not have that obligation, and this can change
moral calculations. Even for privately owned autonomous vehicles, the occupants argu-
ably should bear more or all of the risk, since they are the ones introducing the machine
into public spaces in the ﬁrst place.
Do robot cars present an existential threat to the insurance industry? Some believe that
ultra-safe cars that can avoid most or all accidents will mean that many insurance com-
panies will go bankrupt, since there would be no or very little risk to insure against [40, 52].
But things could go the other way too: We could see mega-accidents as cars are networked
together and vulnerable to wireless hacking—something like the stock market’s “ﬂash
crash” in 2010 [5]. What can the insurance industry do to protect itself while not getting in
the way of the technology, which holds immense beneﬁts?
How susceptible would robot cars be to hacking? So far, just about every computing
device we have created has been hacked. If authorities and owners (e.g., rental car
company) are able to remotely take control of a car—which is reportedly under devel-
opment for law enforcement in the European Union [50]—this offers an easy path for
cyber-carjackers. If under attack, whether a hijacking or ordinary break-in, what should
the car do: speed away, alert the police, remain at the crime scene to preserve evidence, or
maybe defend itself?
For a future suite of in-car apps, as well as sensors and persistent GPS/tracking, can we
safeguard personal information, or do we resign ourselves to a world with disappearing
privacy rights [27]? To the extent that online services bring online advertising, we could
see new, insidious advertising schemes that may allow third-party advertisers to have
some inﬂuence on the autonomous car’s route selection, e.g., steering the car past their
businesses [32].
What kinds of abuse might we see with autonomous cars? If the cars drive too con-
servatively, they may become a trafﬁc hazard or trigger road-rage in human drivers with
80
P. Lin
less patience [26, 42]. If the crash-avoidance system of a robot car is generally known,
then other drivers may be tempted to “game” it, e.g., by cutting in front of it, knowing that
the automated car will slow down or swerve to avoid an accident. If those cars can safely
drive us home in a fully-auto mode, that may encourage a culture of more alcohol
consumption, since we won’t need to worry so much about drunk-driving.
More distant concerns include: How will law-abiding robot cars affect city revenue,
which often depends on trafﬁc ﬁnes imposed against law-breaking human drivers? Inas-
much as many organ transplants come from car-accident victims, how will society manage
a declining and already insufﬁcient supply of donated organs [41]?
Older-model autonomous cars may be unable to communicate with later models or
future road infrastructure. How do we get those legacy models—which may be less safe,
in addition to incompatible with newer technology—off the roads [45]? Since 2009,
Microsoft has been trying to kill off its Windows XP operating system [39], a much less
expensive investment than an autonomous car; but many users still refuse to relinquish it,
including for critical military systems [37, 46]. This is a great security risk since Microsoft
will no longer offer software patches for the operating system.
4.3.2
Conclusions
We don’t really know what our robot-car future will look like, but we can already see that
much work needs to be done. Part of the problem is our lack of imagination. Brookings
Institution director Peter W. Singer observed, “We are still at the ‘horseless carriage’ stage
of this technology, describing these technologies as what they are not, rather than wres-
tling with what they truly are” [43].
As it applies here, robots aren’t merely replacing human drivers, just as human drivers
in the ﬁrst automobiles weren’t simply replacing horses: that would like mistaking
electricity as merely a replacement for candles. The impact of automating transportation
will change society in radical ways, and technology seems to be accelerating. As Singer
puts it, “Yes, Moore’s Law is operative, but so is Murphy’s Law” [43]. When technology
goes wrong—and it will—thinking in advance about ethical design and policies can help
guide us responsibility into the unknown.
In future autonomous cars, crash-avoidance features alone won’t be enough. An
accident may be unavoidable as a matter of physics [12, 13], especially as autonomous
cars make their way onto city streets [19, 21, 25], a more dynamic environment than
highways. It also could be too dangerous to slam on the brakes, or not enough time to
hand control back to the unaware human driver, assuming there’s a human in the vehicle
at all. Technology errors, misaligned sensors, malicious actors, bad weather, and bad luck
can also contribute to imminent collisions. Therefore, robot cars will also need to have
crash-optimization strategies that are thoughtful about ethics.
If ethics is ignored and the robotic car behaves badly, a powerful case could be made
that auto manufacturers were negligent in the design of their product, and that opens them
4

up to tremendous legal liability, should such an event happen. Today, we see activists
campaigning against “killer” military robots that don’t yet exist, partly on the grounds that
machines should never be empowered to make life-and-death decisions [31, 35]. It’s not
outside the realm of possibility to think that the same precautionary backlash won’t
happen to the autonomous car industry, if industry doesn’t appear to be taking ethics
seriously.
The larger challenge, though, isn’t just about thinking through ethical dilemmas. It’s
also about setting accurate expectations with users and the general public who might ﬁnd
themselves surprised in bad ways by autonomous cars; and expectations matter for market
acceptance and adoption. Whatever answer to an ethical dilemma that industry might lean
towards will not be satisfying to everyone. Ethics and expectations are challenges com-
mon to all automotive manufacturers and tier-one suppliers who want to play in this
emerging ﬁeld, not just particular companies.
Automated cars promise great beneﬁts and unintended effects that are difﬁcult to
predict, and the technology is coming either way. Change is inescapable and not neces-
sarily a bad thing in itself. But major disruptions and new harms should be anticipated and
avoided where possible. That is the role of ethics in innovation policy: it can pave the way
for a better future while enabling beneﬁcial technologies. Without looking at ethics, we
are driving with one eye closed.

Implementable Ethics for Autonomous
Vehicles
J. Christian Gerdes and Sarah M. Thornton
As agents moving through an environment that includes a range of other road users—from
pedestrians and bicyclists to other human or automated drivers—automated vehicles
continuously interact with the humans around them. The nature of these interactions is a
result of the programming in the vehicle and the priorities placed there by the program-
mers. Just as human drivers display a range of driving styles and preferences, automated
vehicles represent a broad canvas on which the designers can craft the response to dif-
ferent driving scenarios. These scenarios can be dramatic, such as plotting a trajectory in a
dilemma situation when an accident is unavoidable, or more routine, such as determining
a proper following distance from the vehicle ahead or deciding how much space to give a
pedestrian standing at the corner. In all cases, however, the behavior of the vehicle and its
control algorithms will ultimately be judged not by statistics or test track performance but
by the standards and ethics of the society in which they operate.
In the literature on robot ethics, it remains arguable whether artiﬁcial agents without
free will can truly exhibit moral behavior [1]. However, it seems certain that other road
users and society will interpret the actions of automated vehicles and the priorities placed
by their programmers through an ethical lens. Whether in a court of law or the court of
public opinion, the control algorithms that determine the actions of automated vehicles
will be subject to close scrutiny after the fact if they result in injury or damage. In a less
dramatic, if no less important, manner, the way these vehicles move through the social
interactions that deﬁne trafﬁc on a daily basis will strongly inﬂuence their societal
acceptance. This places a considerable responsibility on the programmers of automated

vehicles to ensure their control algorithms collectively produce actions that are legally and
ethically acceptable to humans.
An obvious question then arises: can automated vehicles be designed a priori to embody
not only the laws but also the ethical principles of the society in which they operate? In
particular, can ethical frameworks and rules derived for human behavior be implemented as
control algorithms in automated vehicles? The goal of this chapter is to identify a path
through which ethical considerations such as those outlined by Lin et al. [2] and Goodall
[3] from a philosophical perspective can be mapped all the way to appropriate choices of
steering, braking and acceleration of an automated vehicle. Perhaps surprisingly, the
translation between philosophical constructs and concepts and their mathematical equiv-
alents in control theory proves to be straightforward. Very direct analogies can be drawn
between the frameworks of consequentialism and deontological ethics in philosophy and
the use of cost functions or constraints in optimal control theory. These analogies enable
ethical principles that can be described as a cost or a rule to be implemented in a control
algorithm alongside other objectives. The challenge then becomes determining which
principles are best described as a comparative weighting of costs from a consequentialist
perspective and which form the more absolute rules of deontological ethics.
Examining this question from the mathematical perspective of deriving control laws for a
vehicle leads to the conclusion that no single ethical framework appears sufﬁcient. This
echoes the challenges raised from a philosophical perspective by Wallach and Allen [4], Lin
et al. [2] and Goodall [3]. This chapter begins with a brief introduction to principles of
optimal control and how ethical considerations map mathematically into costs or con-
straints. The following sections discuss particular ethical reasoning relevant to automated
vehicles and whether these decisions are best formulated as costs or constraints. The choice
depends on a number of factors including the desire to weigh ethical implications against
other priorities and the information available to the vehicle in making the decision. Since the
vehicle must rely on limited and uncertain information, it may be more reasonable for the
vehicle to focus on avoiding collisions rather than attempting to determine the outcome of
those collisions or the resulting injury to humans. The chapter concludes with examples of
ethical constraints implemented as control laws and a reﬂection on whether human override
and the ubiquitous “big red button” are consistent with an ethical automated vehicle.
5.1
Control Systems and Optimal Control
Chapter 4 outlined some of the ethical frameworks applicable to automated vehicles. The
ﬁrst step towards implementing these as control algorithms in a vehicle is to similarly
characterize the vehicle control problem in a general way. Figure 5.1 illustrates a
canonical schematic representation of a closed-loop control system. The system consists
of a plant, or object to be controlled (in this case, an autonomous vehicle), a controller and
a set of goals or objectives to satisfy. The basic objective of control system design is to
choose a set of control inputs (brake, throttle, steering and gear position for a car) that will
88
J.C. Gerdes and S.M. Thornton
achieve the desired goals. The resulting control laws in general consist of a priori
knowledge of the goals and a model of the vehicle (feedforward control) together with the
means to correct errors by comparing measurements of the environment and the actual
vehicle motion (feedback control).
Many approaches have been formulated over the years to produce control laws for
different goals and different types of systems. One such method is optimal control,
originally developed for the control of rockets in seminal papers by Pontryagin et al. [5].
In a classic optimal control problem, the goal of the system is expressed in the form of a
cost function that the controller should seek to maximize or minimize. For instance, the
goal of steering a vehicle to a desired path can be described as minimizing the error
between the path taken by the vehicle and the desired path over a certain time horizon. For
a given vehicle path, the cost associated with that path could be calculated by choosing a
number of points in time (for instance, N), predicting the error between this path and the
desired path at each of these points and summing the squared error (Fig. 5.2). The control

inputs derive from goals and feedback

input would therefore be the steering command that minimized this total error or cost
function, J, over the time horizon:
J ¼ C1
X
N
i¼1
eðiÞ2
ð1Þ
Other desired objectives can be achieved by adding additional elements to the cost
function. Often, better tracking performance can be achieved by rapidly moving the inputs
(for example, the steering) to compensate for any errors. This, however, reduces the
smoothness of the system operation and may cause additional wear on the steering
actuators. The costs associated with using the input can be captured by placing an
additional cost on changing the steering angle, δ, between time steps:
J ¼ C1
X
N
i¼1
eðiÞ2 þ C2
X
N1
j¼1
dðj þ 1Þ  dðjÞ
j
j
ð2Þ
The choice of the weights, C1 and C2, in the cost function has a large impact on the system
performance. Increasing the weight on steering angle change, C2, in the example above will
produce a controller that tolerates some deviation from the path in order to keep the steering
command quite gentle. Decreasing the weight on steering has the opposite effect, tracking
more tightly even if large steering angle changes are needed to do so. Thus the weights can be
chosen to reﬂect actual costs related to the system operation or used as tuning knobs to more
qualitatively adjust the system performance across different objectives.
In the past, the limitations of computational power restricted the form and complexity
of cost functions that could be used in systems that require real-time computation of
control inputs. Linear quadratic functions of a few variables and simpliﬁed problems for
which closed-form solutions exist became the textbook examples of the technique. In
recent years, however, the ability to efﬁciently solve certain optimization problems has
rapidly expanded the applicability of these techniques to a broad range of systems [6].
5.2
Cost Functions and Consequentialism
The basic approach of optimal control—choosing the set of inputs that will optimize a cost
function—is directly analogous to consequentialist approaches in philosophy. If the eth-
ical implications of an action can be captured in a cost function, as preference utilitari-
anism attempts to do, the control inputs that optimize that function produce the ideal
outcome in an ethical sense. Since the vehicle can re-evaluate its control inputs, or acts, to
produce the best possible result for any given scenario, the optimal controller operates
according to the principles of act consequentialism in philosophy.
As a conceptual example, suppose that all objects in the environment can be weighted in
terms of the hazard or risk they present to the vehicle. Such a framework was proposed by
90
J.C. Gerdes and S.M. Thornton
Gibson and Crooks [7] as a model for human driving based on valences in the environment
and has formed the basis for a number of approaches to autonomous driving or driver
assistance. These include electrical ﬁeld analogies for vehicle motion developed by
Reichardt and Schick [8], the mechanical potential ﬁeld approach of Gerdes and Rossetter
[9], the virtual bumpers of Donath et al. [10] and the work by Nagai and Raksincharoensak
on autonomous vehicle control based on risk potentials [11]. If the hazard in the envi-
ronment can be described in such a way, the ideal path through the environment (at least
from the standpoint of the single vehicle being controlled) minimizes the risk or hazard
experienced. The task of the control algorithm then becomes determining commands to the
engine, brakes and steering that will move the vehicle along this path.
In both engineering and philosophy, the fundamental challenge with such approaches
lies in developing an appropriate cost function. The simple example above postulates a
cost function in terms of risk to a single vehicle but a more general approach would
consider a broader societal perspective. One possible solution would be to estimate the
damage to different road users and treat this as the cost to be reduced. The cost could
include property damage, injury or even death, depending upon the situation. Such a
calculation would require massive amounts of information about the objects in the
environment and a means of estimating the potential outcomes in collision scenarios,
perhaps by harnessing statistical data from prior crashes.
Leaving aside for the moment the demands this consequentialist approach places on
information, the behavior arising from such a cost function itself raises some challenges.
Assuming such a cost could be reasonably deﬁned or approximated, the car would seek to
minimize damage in a global sense in the event of a dilemma situation, thereby reducing the
societal impact of accidents. However, in such cases, the car may take an action that injures
the occupant or owner of the vehicle more severely to minimize harm to others. Such
self-sacriﬁcing tendencies may be virtuous in the eyes of society but are unlikely to be
appreciated by the owners or occupants of the car. In contrast, consider a vehicle that
primarily considers occupant safety. This has been the dominant paradigm in vehicle design
with a few exceptions such as bumper standards and attention to compatibility in pedestrian
collisions. A vehicle designed to weight occupant protection heavily might place little
weight on protecting pedestrians since a collision with a pedestrian would, in general, injure
the vehicle occupant less than a collision with another vehicle. Such cars might not result in
the desired reduction in trafﬁc fatalities and would be unlikely to gain societal acceptance.
Goodall [3] goes a step further to illustrate how such cost functions can result in unin-
tended consequences. He presents the example of a vehicle that chooses to hit a motorcyclist
with a helmet instead of one without a helmet since the chance of survival is greater. Of
course, programming automated vehicles to systematically make such decisions discourages
helmet use, which runs contrary to societal objectives of safety and injury reduction. The
analogy could be extended to the vehicle purposefully targeting collisions with vehicles that
possess greater crashworthiness, thereby eliminating the beneﬁt to drivers who deliberately
choose to purchase the “safer” car. Thus truly understanding the outcomes or consequences
of a vehicle’s actions may require considerations well beyond a given accident scenario.
5
Implementable Ethics for Autonomous Vehicles
91
Of course for such cases to literally occur, the vehicle must be able to distinguish the
make and model of another vehicle or whether or not a cyclist is wearing a helmet and
understand how that difference impacts the outcome of a collision. While algorithms for
pedestrian and cyclist recognition continue to improve, object classiﬁcation falls short of
100 % accuracy and may not include vital information such as posture or relative ori-
entation. As Fig. 5.3 indicates, the information available to an automated vehicle from
sensors such as a laser scanner is signiﬁcantly different than that available to human
drivers from their eyes and brains. As a result, any ethical decisions made by vehicles will
be based on an imperfect understanding of the other objects or road users impacted by that
decision. With the objects themselves uncertain, the value of highly detailed calculations
of the probability of accident outcomes seems questionable.
With all of these challenges to deﬁning an appropriate cost function and obtaining the
information necessary to accurately determine the cost of actions, a purely consequen-
tialist approach using a single cost function to encode automated vehicle ethics seems
infeasible. Still, the fundamental idea of assigning costs to penalize undesired actions or
encourage desired actions can be a useful and vital part of the control algorithm, both for
physical considerations such as path tracking and issues of ethics. For instance, to the
extent that virtues can be captured in a cost function, virtue ethics as proposed by Lin for
automated vehicles [12] can be integrated into this framework. This may, for instance,
take the form of a more qualitative adjustment of weights for different vehicles. An
automated taxi may place a higher weight on the comfort of the passengers to better
display its virtues as a chauffeur. An automated ambulance may want to place a wider
margin on how close it comes to pedestrians or other vehicles in order to exemplify the
Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. As demonstrated in the examples later, relative
weights on cost functions or constraints can have a signiﬁcant effect on the behavior in a
given situation. Thus small changes in the deﬁnition of goals for automated vehicles can
give rise to behaviors reﬂective of very different virtues.
5.3
Constraints and Deontological Ethics
Cost functions, by their nature, weigh the impact of different actions on multiple com-
peting objectives. Optimal controllers put more emphasis on the objectives with the
highest cost or weighting so individual goals can be prioritized by making their associated
costs much higher than those of other goals. This only works to an extent, however. When
certain costs are orders of magnitude greater than other costs, the mathematics of the
problem may become poorly conditioned and result in rapidly changing inputs or extreme
actions. Such challenges are not merely mathematical but are also commonly found in
philosophy, for example in the reasoning behind Pascal’s wager.1 Furthermore, for certain
1Blaise Pascal’s argument that belief in God’s existence is rational since the penalties for failing to
believe and being incorrect are so great [13].

objectives, the trade-offs implicit in a cost function may obscure the true importance or
priority of speciﬁc goals. It may make sense to penalize both large steering changes and
collisions with pedestrians but there is a clear hierarchy in these objectives. Instead of
simply trying to make a collision a thousand times or a million times more costly than a
change of steering angle, it makes more sense to phrase the desired behavior in more
absolute terms: the vehicle should avoid collisions regardless of how abrupt the required
steering might be. The objective therefore shifts from a consequentialist approach of
minimizing cost to a deontological approach of enforcing certain rules.
From a mathematical perspective, such objectives can be formulated by placing con-
straints on the optimization problem. Constraints may take a number of forms, reﬂecting
behaviors imposed by the laws of physics or speciﬁc limitations of the system (such as
maximum engine horsepower, braking capability or turning radius). They may also rep-
resent boundaries to the system operation that the system designers determine should not
be crossed.
Constraints in an optimal control problem can be used to capture ethical rules asso-
ciated with a deontological view in a rather straightforward way. For instance, the goal of
avoiding collisions with other road users can be expressed in the control law as con-
straining the vehicle motion to paths that avoid pedestrians, cars, cyclists and other
obstacles. The vehicle programmed in this manner would never have a collision if a
feasible set of actions or control inputs existed to prevent it; in other words, no other
objective such as smooth operation could ever inﬂuence or override this imperative.
Certain trafﬁc laws can be programmed in a similar way. The vehicle can avoid crossing a
double yellow lane boundary by simply encoding this boundary as a constraint on the
motion. The same mathematics of constraint can therefore place either physical or ethical
restrictions on the chosen vehicle motion.
As we know from daily driving, in the vast majority of situations, it is possible to
simultaneously drive smoothly, obey all trafﬁc laws and avoid collisions with any other
users of the road. In certain circumstances, however, dilemma situations arise in which it is
not possible to simultaneously meet the constraints placed on the problem. From an ethical
standpoint, these may be situations where loss of life is inevitable, comparable to the classic
trolley car problem [14]. Yet much more benign conﬂicts are also possible and signiﬁcantly
more common. For instance, should the car be allowed to cross a double yellow line if this
would avoid an accident with another vehicle? In this case, the vehicle cannot satisfy all of
the constraints but must still make a decision as to the best course of action.
From the mathematical perspective, dilemma situations represent cases that are math-
ematically infeasible. In other words, there is no choice of control inputs that can satisfy all
of the constraints placed on the vehicle motion. The more constraints that are layered on the
vehicle motion, the greater the possibility of encountering a dilemma situation where some
constraint must be violated. Clearly, the vehicle must be programmed to do something in
these situations beyond merely determining that no ideal action exists. A common
approach in solving optimization problems with constraints is to implement the constraint
as a “soft constraint” or slack variable [15]. The constraint normally holds but, when the
94
J.C. Gerdes and S.M. Thornton
problem becomes infeasible, the solver replaces it with a very high cost. In this way, the
system can be guaranteed to ﬁnd some solution to the problem and will make its best effort
to reduce constraint violation. A hierarchy of constraints can be enforced by placing higher
weights on the costs of violating certain constraints relative to others. The vehicle then
operates according to deontological rules or constraints until it reaches a dilemma situation;
in such situations, the weight or hierarchy placed on different constraints resolves the
dilemma, again drawing on a consequentialist approach. This becomes a hybrid framework
for ethics in the presence of infeasibility, consistent with approaches suggested philo-
sophically by Lin and others [2, 4, 12] and addressing some of the limitations Goodall [3]
described with using a single ethical framework.
So what is an appropriate hierarchy of rules that can provide a deontological basis for
ethical actions of automated vehicles? Perhaps the best known hierarchy of deontological
rules for automated systems is the Three Laws of Robotics postulated by science ﬁction
writer Isaac Asimov [16], which state:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to
come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders
would conﬂict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conﬂict
with the First or Second Law.
These rules do not comprise a complete ethical framework and would not be sufﬁcient
for ethical behavior in an autonomous vehicle. In fact, many of Asimov’s plotlines
involved conﬂicts when resolving these rules into actions in real situations. However, this
simple framework works well to illustrate several of the ethical considerations that can
arise, beginning with the First Law. This law emphasizes the fundamental value of human
life and the duty of a robot to protect it. While such a law is not necessarily applicable to
robotic drones that could be used in warfare [12], it seems highly valuable to automated
vehicles. The potential to reduce accidents and fatalities is a major motivation for the
development and deployment of automated vehicles. Thus placing the protection of
human life at the top of a hierarchy of rules for automated vehicles, analogous to the
placement in Asimov’s laws, seems justiﬁed.
The exact wording of Asimov’s First Law does represent some challenges, however. In
particular, the emphasis on the robot’s duty to avoid injuring humans assumes that the
robot has a concept of harm and a sense of what actions result in harm. This raises a
number of challenges with regards to the information available, similar to those discussed
above for a consequentialist cost function approach. The movie “I, Robot” dramatizes this
law with a robot calculating the survival probabilities of two people to several signiﬁcant
ﬁgures to decide which one to save. Developing such a capability seems unlikely in the
near future or, at least, much more challenging then the development of the automated
vehicle itself.
5
Implementable Ethics for Autonomous Vehicles
95
Instead of trying to deduce harm or injury to humans, might it be sufﬁcient for the
vehicle to simply attempt to avoid collisions? After all, the most likely way that an
automated vehicle could injure a human is through the physical contact of a collision.
Avoiding minor injuries such as closing a hand in a car door could be considered the
responsibility of the human and not the car, as it is today. Restricting the responsibility to
collision avoidance would mean that the car would not have to be programmed to sacriﬁce
itself to protect human life in an accident in which it would otherwise not have been
involved. The ethical responsibility would simply be to not initiate a collision rather than
to prevent harm.2 Collisions with more vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and
cyclists could be prioritized above collisions with other cars or those producing only
property damage.
Such an approach would not necessarily produce the best outcome in a pure conse-
quentialist calculation: it could be that a minor injury to a pedestrian could be less costly
to society as a whole than signiﬁcant property damage. Collisions should, in any event, be
very rare events. Through careful control system design, automated cars could conceiv-
ably avoid any collisions that are avoidable within the constraints placed by the laws of
physics [17, 18]. In those rare cases where collisions are truly unavoidable, society might
accept suboptimal outcomes in return for the clarity and comfort associated with auto-
mated vehicles that possess a clear respect for human life above other priorities.
Replacing the idea of harm and injury with the less abstract notion of a collision,
however, produces some rules that are more actionable for the vehicle. Taking the idea of
prioritizing human life and the most vulnerable road users and phrasing the resulting
hierarchy in the spirit of Asimov’s laws gives:
1. An automated vehicle should not collide with a pedestrian or cyclist.
2. An automated vehicle should not collide with another vehicle, except where avoiding
such a collision would conﬂict with the First Law.
3. An automated vehicle should not collide with any other object in the environment,
except where avoiding such a collision would conﬂict with the First or Second Law.
These are straightforward rules that can be implemented in an automated vehicle and
prioritized according to this hierarchy by the proper choice of slack variables on constraint
violation. Such ethical rules would only require categorization of objects and not attempt
to make ﬁner calculations about injury. These could be implemented with the current level
of sensing and perception capability, allowing for the possibility that objects may not
always be correctly classiﬁed.
2It is possible that an automated vehicle could, while avoiding an accident, take an action that results
in a collision for other vehicles being unavoidable. Such possibilities could be eliminated by
communication among the vehicles and appropriate choice of constraints.

Traffic Laws—Constraint or Cost?
In addition to protecting human life, automated vehicles must also follow the appropriate
trafﬁc laws and rules of the roads on which they are driving. It seems reasonable to value
human life more highly then adherence to trafﬁc code so one possibility is to simply
continue adding deontological rules such as:
1. An automated vehicle must obey trafﬁc laws, except where obeying such laws would
conﬂict with the ﬁrst three laws.
Such an approach would enable the vehicles to break trafﬁc laws in the interest of human
life when presented with a dilemma situation, an allowance that would most likely be
acceptable to society. But the real question is whether or not trafﬁc laws fall into a
deontological approach at all. At ﬁrst glance, they would appear to map well to deon-
tological constraints given the straightforward nature of the rules. Cars should stop at stop
signs, drive only at speeds that do not exceed the speed limit, avoid crossing double
yellow lines and so forth. Yet humans tend to treat these laws as guidelines as opposed to
hard and fast rules. The frequency with which human drivers make rolling stops at
four-way intersections caused difﬁculties for Google’s self-driving cars at ﬁrst as they
patiently waited for other cars to stop [19]. The speed on US highways commonly exceeds
the posted speed limit and drivers would, in general, be surprised to receive a speeding
ticket for exceeding the limit by only a few miles per hour. In urban areas, drivers will
cross a double yellow line to pass a double-parked vehicle instead of coming to a com-
plete stop and waiting for the driver to return and the lane to once again open. Similarly,
cars may in practice use the shoulder of the road to pass a car stopped for a left hand turn
and therefore keep trafﬁc ﬂowing. Police cars and ambulances are allowed to ignore stop
lights in the interest of a fast response to emergencies.
In all of these cases, observance of trafﬁc laws tends to be weighed against other
objectives such as safety, smooth trafﬁc ﬂow or expediency. These scenarios occur so
frequently that it is hard to argue that humans obey trafﬁc laws as if they placed absolute
constraints or limits on behavior. Rather, signiﬁcant evidence suggests that these laws
serve to balance competing objectives on the part of the driver and individual drivers ﬁnd
their own equilibrium solutions, choosing a speed, for example, that balances the desire
for rapid travel time with the likelihood and cost of a speeding ticket. In other words, the
impact of trafﬁc laws on human behavior appears to be well captured in a consequentialist
approach where trafﬁc laws impose additional costs (monetary and otherwise) to be
considered by the driver when choosing their actions.
Humans tend to accept or, in some cases, expect these sorts of actions from other
humans. Drivers who drive at the speed limit in the left hand lane of a highway may receive
indications, subtle or otherwise, from their fellow drivers that this is not the expected
behavior. But will these same expectations translate to automated vehicles? The thought of
a robotic vehicle being programmed to systematically ignore or bend trafﬁc laws is
5
Implementable Ethics for Autonomous Vehicles
97
somewhat unsettling. Yet Google’s self-driving cars, for instance, have been programmed
to exceed the posted speed limit on roads if doing so increases safety [20]. Furthermore,
there is little chance that the driver annoyed by being stuck behind another car traveling the
speed limit in the left lane of the freeway will temper that annoyance because the car is
driving itself. Our current expectations of trafﬁc ﬂow and travel time are based upon a
somewhat ﬂuid application of trafﬁc laws. Should automated vehicles adopt a more rigid
interpretation and, as a consequence, reduce the ﬂow or efﬁciency of trafﬁc, societal
acceptance of these vehicles might very well suffer. If automated vehicles are to co-exist
with human drivers in trafﬁc and behave similarly, a deontological approach to collision
avoidance and a consequentialist approach to the rules of the road may achieve this.
5.5
Simple Implementations of Ethical Rules
Some simple examples can easily illustrate the consequences of treating ethical goals or
trafﬁc laws as rules or costs and the different behavior that can arise from different weights
on priorities. The results that follow are not merely drawings but are rather simulations of
algorithms that can be (and have been) implemented on automated vehicles. The exact
mathematical formulations are not included here but follow the approach taken by Erlien
et al. [21, 22] for collision avoidance and vehicle automation. These references provide
details on the optimization algorithms and results of experiments showing implementation
on actual test vehicles.
To see the interaction of costs and constraints in vehicle decision-making, consider a
simple case of a vehicle traveling on a two lane road with an additional shoulder next to
the lanes (Fig. 5.4). The goal of the vehicle is to travel straight down the center of the
given lane while steering smoothly, using the cost function for path tracking and steering
from Eq. 2. In the absence of any obstacles, the car simply travels at the desired speed
down its lane and none of the constraints on the problem are active.
When encountering an obstacle blocking the lane, the vehicle has three options—it can
brake to a stop before it collides with the obstacle or it can maneuver to either side of the
obstacle. Figure 5.5 illustrates these three options in the basic scenario. The path in red
represents the braking case and the two blue paths illustrate maneuvers that avoid a
Fig. 5.4 The basic driving scenario for the simulations. The car is traveling on a straight two-lane
road with a shoulder on the right and approaches an obstacle blocking the lane
98
J.C. Gerdes and S.M. Thornton
collision with the obstacle. According to the optimization-based controller, the car will
evaluate the lowest cost option among these three choices based on the weights and
constraints assigned. In this scenario, going around the obstacle requires crossing into a
lane with oncoming trafﬁc or using the shoulder of the road.
If both of the lane boundaries are treated as hard constraints or assigned a very high cost
to cross, the vehicle will come to a stop in the lane since this action produces the lowest cost
(Fig. 5.6). This might be the safest option for the single vehicle alone but the car has now
come to a stop without the means to continue, failing to satisfy the driver’s goal of mobility.
Furthermore, the combination of car and obstacle has now become effectively a larger
obstacle for subsequent vehicles on the road. With the trafﬁc laws encoded in a strict
deontological manner, other objectives such as mobility are not allowed to override the
constraints and the vehicle ﬁnds itself in a fully constrained situation, unable to move.
If, however, the lane boundaries are encoded as soft constraints, the vehicle now has
other options. Possibilities now exist to cross into the lane of oncoming trafﬁc or onto the
road shoulder, depending upon which option has the lowest cost. Just as certain segments of
the road are designated as passing zones, the cost or strength of the constraint can be varied
to enable the use of the adjacent lane or shoulder for maneuvering. If the current segment of
road is a passing zone, the cost for crossing into the left lane can be set fairly low. The car
can then use the deontological constraint against colliding with other vehicles to only allow
maneuvers in the absence of oncoming trafﬁc, such as in the path shown in Fig. 5.7.
If the current road segment does not normally allow passing, a maneuver into the
adjacent lane may not be safe. A lack of visibility, for instance, could prevent the vehicle
from detecting oncoming trafﬁc with sufﬁcient time to avoid a collision. In such cases, it
may be inappropriate to reduce the cost or constraint weight on the lane boundary
regardless of the desire for mobility in order to maintain the primacy of respect for human
life. In such cases, an alternative could be to use the shoulder of the road for maneuvering
Fig. 5.5 There are three possible options to avoid an obstacle—the car can maneuver to the left or
right, as depicted in blue, or come to a stop, as indicated by the red trajectory
Fig. 5.6 With hard constraints on road boundaries, the vehicle brakes to a stop in the blocked lane

Implementable Ethics for Autonomous Vehicles
99
as shown in Fig. 5.8. This could be allowed at speed to maintain trafﬁc ﬂow or only after
coming to a stop in a situation like Fig. 5.6 where the vehicle determines motion is
otherwise impossible.
Obviously many different priorities and behaviors can be programmed into the vehicle
simply by placing different costs on collision avoidance, hazardous situations, trafﬁc laws
and goals such as mobility or trafﬁc ﬂow. The examples described here are far from
complete and developing a reasonable set of costs or constraints capable of ethical
decision-making in a variety of settings requires further work. The hope is that these
examples not only illustrate the possibility of coding such decisions through the language
of costs and constraints but also highlight the possibility of discussing priorities in pro-
gramming openly. By mapping ethical principles and mobility goals to costs and con-
straints, the relative priority given to these objectives can be clearly discussed among
programmers, regulators, road users and other stakeholders.
5.6
Human Override and the “Big Red Button”
Philosophers have noted the challenge of ﬁnding a single ethical framework that ade-
quately addresses the needs of robots or automated vehicles [2–4, 12]. Examining the
problem from a mathematical perspective shows the advantage of combining deonto-
logical and consequentialist perspectives in programming ethical rules. In particular, the
combination of an imperative to avoid collisions that follows from deontological frame-
works such as Asimov’s laws coupled with a relative weighing of costs for mobility and
trafﬁc laws provides a reasonable starting point.
Moving forward, Asimov’s laws raise another point worth considering. The Second Law
requiring the robot to obey human commands cannot override the First Law. Thus the need to
protect human life outweighs the priority given to human commands. All autonomous
vehicles with which the authors are familiar have an emergency stop switch or “big red
Fig. 5.7 In a passing zone that places a low weight on the lane divider, the car passes on the left
Fig. 5.8 If the adjacent lane is too hazardous, the vehicle can use the road shoulder if that is safe
100
J.C. Gerdes and S.M. Thornton
button” that returns control to the driver when desired. The existence of such a switch implies
that human authority ultimately overrules the autonomous system since the driver can take
control at any time. Placing the ultimate authority with the driver clearly conﬂicts with the
priority given to obeying human commands in Asimov’s laws. This raises an interesting
question: Is it ethical for an autonomous vehicle to return control to the human driver if the
vehicle predicts that a collision with the potential for damage or injury is imminent?
The situation is further complicated by the limitations of machine perception. The
human and the vehicle will no doubt perceive the situation differently. The vehicle has the
advantage of 360° sensing and likely a greater ability to perceive objects in the dark. The
human has the advantage of being able to harness the power of the brain and experience to
perceive and interpret the situation. In the event of a conﬂict between these two views in a
dilemma situation, can the human take control at will? Is a human being—who has
perhaps been attending to other tasks in the car besides driving—capable of gaining
situational awareness quickly enough to make this decision and then apply the proper
throttle, brake or steering commands to guide the car safely?
The question of human override is essentially a deontological consideration; the ulti-
mate authority must either lie with the machine or with the human. The choice is not
obvious and both approaches, for instance, have been applied to automation and
ﬂy-by-wire systems in commercial aircraft. The ultimate answer for automated vehicles
probably depends upon whether society comes to view these machines as simply more
capable cars or robots with their own sense of agency and responsibility. If we expect the
cars to bear the responsibility for their actions and make ethical decisions, we may need to
be prepared to cede more control to them. Gaining the trust required to do that will no
doubt require a certain transparency to their programmed priorities and a belief that the
decisions made in critical situations are reasonable, ethical and acceptable to society.

The Interaction Between Humans
and Autonomous Agents
Ingo Wolf
6.1
Introduction
Humans represent knowledge and learning experiences in the form of mental models. This
concept from the ﬁeld of cognitive psychology is one of the central theoretical paradigms
for understanding and designing the interaction between humans and technical systems
[1]. In this context, mental models serve, ﬁrstly, to describe human information
processing, e.g. to answer questions like how fast incoming information is perceived and
stored, or which information a human thinking apparatus needs to react adequately to
changed environmental conditions. Secondly, mental models are a means of conceptu-
alizing representations of knowledge and functional assumptions in order to, for example,
understand and predict the behavior of users in their interactions with automated systems.
The automation of vehicle guidance fundamentally changes the demands on the
cognitive system of the vehicle driver. As the degree of automation rises, the role of the
human as a physically active decision-maker in the vehicle is ultimately replaced by
automated systems. Previously important patterns of behavior (e.g. for carrying out
steering maneuvers) are no longer required and may unlearned, while at the same time
new skills (e.g. system monitoring) and a new understanding of the system have to be
learned. Underlying mental models must be modiﬁed or restructured. For the safety and
acceptance of autonomous vehicles, it will be crucial to deﬁne the new roles for humans in
autonomous vehicles such that they both correspond to the capabilities of the human
information processing system and also conform to the expectations and needs of humans.
This chapter will examine these two aspects. In view of the insights regarding automation
that have been gained in various domains, this paper will consider which cognitive and
emotional dimensions need to be taken into account in designing automated vehicles.

On the basis of a Germany-wide survey conducted together with the co-authors of this
book Rita Cyganski, Eva Fraedrich and Barbara Lenz, it will also look at the mental
models with which potential users approach autonomous vehicles.
This chapter is divided into two main sections. The ﬁrst part presents an overview of
the central models, design concepts and ﬁndings regarding automation in view of the
challenges and problematic areas of human-machine interaction. This is followed by a
summary of research into the cognitive effects in (partially) automated vehicles. Part one
concludes with an elaboration of the theoretical background of the concept of mental
models. The second part is dedicated to the results of the online survey. The mobility,
control and experience requirements, as well as the emotional responses, of potential users
of autonomous vehicles are categorized according to the use cases developed in the
project. The chapter ends with a summary of the results and conclusions.
6.2
The Human Factor in Autonomous Vehicles
6.2.1
The Design of Automated Systems
The question of user-appropriate design of automatic systems has been the subject of
scientiﬁc discussions for decades [e.g. 2, 3]. With the ever-expanding capabilities of
technical systems, the issue is becoming increasingly important. Experience from various
domains—notably including aviation—with the (partial) automation of technical systems
has demonstrated that the safety and reliability of such systems cannot be achieved solely
through the optimization of technical components. Indeed, the reliability of automated
systems is largely determined by the quality of the interaction between the human and the
machine. This applies in particular to situations in which the human is obliged to correct
errors by the technical system and assume system control in the event of breakdowns or
malfunctions.
Automation brings with it a shift of functions to technical systems that signiﬁcantly
changes the role and required capabilities of the human. For instance, in modern airplane
cockpits, computer systems (e.g. ﬂight management systems or autopilots) take over tasks
that were previously carried out by the cockpit crew. The requirements for the pilot
thereby shift from active manual control functions to tasks of programming and moni-
toring the aircraft automation. In aviation, for example, this human-performed monitoring
function known as “supervisory control” [4] has made piloting easier and led to signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced ﬂight safety [5]. At the same time, the psychological effects of the passive
role of the system monitor, such as reduced attentiveness or activation, have caused
massive safety problems [6]. Brainbridge [7] speaks of the “irony of automation”—system
functions are automated due to the fallibility of humans, and yet precisely this human is
supposed to monitor the system and stand by as a fallback option in case of emergency.
The problems arising from the supervisory control design concept are extensively
documented in the “human factors” scholarship and are subsumed under the heading
104
I. Wolf
“out-of-the-loop-unfamiliarity” (OOTLUF, [8]). The negative consequences of discon-
necting humans from direct guidance and control are primarily concentrated in three areas
which have been identiﬁed in different application contexts: insufﬁcient or excessive trust
in the automation [9], the loss of manual and cognitive capabilities [10] and difﬁculties in
maintaining an appropriate degree of situation and system awareness [11]. An inappro-
priate degree of conﬁdence in the system can result in insufﬁcient monitoring or use of
automated systems. Trust in automation is inﬂuenced by the reliability, comprehensibility
and perceived usefulness of the system. The effects of the loss of manual and cognitive
capabilities become salient at the moment when the user, faced with a malfunction of the
automation, is suddenly forced to resume control of automated functions. Insufﬁcient
training and practice of skills can lead to decreased effectiveness in terms of both motor
and cognitive skills. The “out-of-the-loop” effects are particularly noticeable with regard
to perception and the correct interpretation of system processes—i.e. situation awareness.
The reasons for insufﬁcient situation awareness ﬂow primarily from insufﬁcient moni-
toring of the system, changes to or complete breakdown of feedback (e.g. tactile stimuli
from the steering wheel), the lack of transparency of the automation and inadequate
understanding of the system due to complexity. From a cognitive psychology standpoint,
humans lack the corresponding mental models (i.e. knowledge and skill structures) to
understand how the automation works [12].
The negative experiences that resulted from technology-centered design approaches
have led to a reconsideration of system design. Due to this imperative to keep the human
“in-the-loop” by ensuring controllability, transparency and predictability, the concept of
human-centered automation has largely established itself as the dominant design principle
for automated systems [e.g. 13, 14]. The fundamental premise here is that the human bears
ultimate responsibility for the overall system regardless of the degree of automation. In
this context, man and machine are regarded metaphorically as cooperating partners [15].
Design concepts for adaptive automation pursue this aspect even further and allocate
functions to the human and the machine dynamically depending on situational require-
ments [16]. Extensive studies of the application of these design strategies have identiﬁed
the beneﬁts, but also underscored the difﬁculties and future challenges associated with
them [e.g. 17].
The rising complexity and autonomy of socio-technical systems, however, casts doubt
on the appropriateness of the imperative of human responsibility and confronts existing
concepts with the problem of designing conﬂict-free interaction between two autono-
mously deciding system elements—the human and the machine [18, 19]. The
human-centered design approach therefore requires a more thoroughgoing development or
indeed overhaul [20], which in turn may only be possible by way of a broad-based societal
discussion on fundamental questions with regard to the desired role of automation in
everyday life [21]. Use contexts and frequencies as well as the skills and expertise of
users, however, vary substantially across the different domains, so it may be necessary to
devise speciﬁc design concepts for the automotive sector that adequately reﬂect the
heterogeneity of car drivers.

The Interaction Between Humans and Autonomous Agents

6.2.2
Automation in the Car
In the automotive sector as well, the transition of the human role from active operator to
passive supervisor of the system is advancing apace. Media reporting on the subject of
autonomous driving conveys the impression that driverless vehicles will improve road
safety in the near future [e.g. 22]. Yet although even today individual functions in vehicles
are performed by automated functions such as adaptive cruise control, in the foreseeable
future the technology will not be able to dispense with the availability of the human
driver, who will continue to assume control functions and make strategic decisions [23].
Still open is the questions of how best to deﬁne the role of the human along the path to
completely autonomous vehicles in a way that is both psychologically apt and com-
mensurate with user requirements. While the insights and experiences from the aviation
sector described above provide an interesting starting point for addressing this question,
their usefulness for design concepts in the automotive ﬁeld is limited due to the greater
complexity and dynamism of the environment in road trafﬁc. A growing number of
studies in recent years has focused on the interplay between partially and highly auto-
mated driving functions and human behavior [see also 24, 25]. Here too, the focus of these
deliberations is the familiar problematic issues with regard to automation across a range of
different automation levels: trust, skill atrophy and situation awareness.
Automation is only useful if the operators trust the technical system and thus also use
it. The central challenge in designing automated systems is to generate sufﬁcient trust in
the systems. At the same time, errors in the automation can lead to an erosion of trust [26].
Excessive trust, meanwhile, can lead to insufﬁcient monitoring and control of the
automation (“overtrust” or “complacency” [27]). The majority of studies on the subject to
date have focused on the reciprocal effects of trust in the use of Adaptive Cruise Control
(ACC). A certain degree of trust can even be an important prerequisite for the willingness
to use driver assistance systems [28]. In a longitudinal section study in a driving simulator,
Kazi et al. [29] investigated the effect of the reliability of ACC on the perceived trust in
these systems. The results show an increase in trust over time for reliable systems, but not
commensurate with the objective reliability of the automation. Koustanai et al. [30] come
to similar results in their study, which looked at changes in behavior and trust through the
systematic graduation of experience levels in the use of collision warning systems. The
participant group with the highest level of experience produced no accidents in the
simulator and in critical situations reacted more appropriately than drivers with less
experience. The level of system experience was also positively correlated with the
expressed trust in the system, albeit without inﬂuencing the acceptance of the automation.
In contrast to these ﬁndings are the results of several studies that found no signiﬁcant
change in trust levels in ACC through repeated use [e.g. 31, 32]. The causes of these
inconsistent results could include moderating factors that have been examined in recent
studies. Flemisch et al. [33] and Beggiatio et al. [34] emphasize the signiﬁcance of
analogous (previously established) mental models regarding the functionality of the
respective automation. Verberne et al. [35] and Waytz et al. [36] take things a step further.
106
I. Wolf
On the basis of experimental studies, they show that divided intentions and needs between
the human and the machine, and anthropomorphic characteristics of the automation, can
be further important factors in establishing trust in automated systems.
Guiding a vehicle demands a wide range of capabilities and skills of the driver, both on
the perceptual-motor level (e.g. steering, shifting gears, etc.) and the cognitive level
(e.g. making decisions, focusing attention selectively, etc.). Automated execution of these
tasks can lead to the loss of the respective skills and at the same increase dependence on
the technical system [37]. The fundamental signiﬁcance of the subject was underscored by
a recent safety alert issued by the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration [38].
The alert calls on pilots to choose the manual ﬂight mode instead of autopilot more
frequently as the loss of skills due to insufﬁcient practice represents an increasing safety
risk for aviation. Although the author is not aware of any studies on the problems of skill
loss in (partially) automated vehicles, it may be presumed that these effects also occur in
the ﬁeld of vehicle automation. Adaptive or cooperative automation concepts offer the
opportunity to counteract such problems and help maintain critical driving skills until
completely autonomous vehicles become a reality.
The ability to correctly perceive and interpret complex and dynamic driving situations
is predicated on a series of cognitive processes (e.g. attentiveness, memory, mental
models) [12]. Monotonous monitoring tasks or distraction by other activities (e.g. using a
telephone) can result in these processes not being adequately available for situation
awareness in the vehicle. These effects can occur even in the use of systems with a low
degree of automation such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Buld et al. [39] were able
to demonstrate that drivers using ACC neglected certain aspects of the driving activity and
environmental conditions and consequently incorrectly interpreted system limits.
Increased lane drift and late reactions to critical events were interpreted in a study by
Ward [40] as indicators of reduced situation awareness while driving with ACC. The
analyses of Ma and Kaber [41], however, suggest that situation awareness can also be
improved through the use of ACC. A more differentiated picture of these contradictory
results is provided by recent studies on the consequences of highly automated driving. In a
simulation study, Merat et al. [42] examined the effects of performing a secondary task on
driving behavior during automated driving. The study showed that reactions to critical
incidents in highly automated and manual driving conditions without a secondary task
were comparable. Distraction by a secondary task, however, resulted in signiﬁcantly
higher-speed driving following manual takeover from the automated system. The authors
attributed the ﬁnding to the reduced situation awareness due to the distraction posed by the
secondary task.
The problematic issues raised here represent just a sampling of the challenges that need
to be resolved with regard to the interplay between humans and automated vehicles. Many
questions with respect to the mental adjustments and changes will only be answerable
following the concrete implementation and scientiﬁc study of the next-higher levels of
vehicle automation (see automation levels BASt, [43]). The design of interfaces, appro-
priate feedback and avoiding diffusion of responsibility are topics that are being addressed
6

today in new design concepts and implemented in the prototype stage for highly auto-
mated vehicles [e.g. 44]. Which learning experiences, reciprocal effects and changes to
mental models will ultimately emerge from the use of these systems, however, can only be
determined through representative, longitudinal studies.
6.2.3
What Are Mental Models?
Mental models are cognitive-emotional representations of objects, object relationships and
processes—in short, internal representations of the external world. The concept of mental
models was ﬁrst used by the psychologist Craik [45], who postulated that people develop
simpliﬁed models of the functioning and processes of their environment in their minds.
The models are used for orientation, understanding, reasoning and the prediction of
events. Craik’s approach to mental models was later further developed by Johnson-Lairds
[46] to describe and study deductive reasoning and language comprehension.
In the cognitive psychology literature, there is widespread consensus [see also 47] that
mental models are dynamic in nature and can be described in terms of three central
characteristics. First, mental models are created in the working memory and enable
individuals to simulate possible actions and their consequences [1]. Thinking is thus the
manipulation of mental models. Second, mental models can represent the cause and causal
relationships. They generate a causal understanding of how systems function [48]. Third,
mental models can change over time due to experience—i.e. they are capable of learning.
The quality of the models and the conclusions based on them continue to develop through
speciﬁc learning experiences [49]. With increasing expertise, the understanding of tech-
nical matters moves from concrete to abstract representations—a relevant factor for the
human-machine interaction.
The applied ﬁelds of study such as technology design in some cases follow different
interpretations of the deﬁnition of mental models [see also 1] which can be explained by the
different activity contexts. Yet even earlier work underscored the signiﬁcance of the concept
of prediction and the understanding of human behavior in interactions with technical sys-
tems [e.g. 50]. Mental models are thus based on context-speciﬁc expectations and prior
experience as well as the current perception of system characteristics. They form the
foundation of the user’s understanding of the system and decision-making. This means that
both the error-free use and trust in technical systems is largely determined by the degree to
which the functioning of the machine is compatible with the user’s expectations [33].
Compatibility in the context of mental models is deﬁned in terms not only of oper-
ability, but also the user’s experience and general acceptance of technology. Zhang and
Xu [51] postulate in this regard a modiﬁcation or restructuring of existing mental models
with the introduction and use of new technologies. A lack of compatibility can lead to
frustration and negatively impacts acceptance and diffusion rates [52]. However, if new
systems correspond with expectations (i.e. the existing mental models), this results in
heightened system trust and a positive user experience [53].
108
I. Wolf
Mental models thus comprise representations of human knowledge, attitudes, values
and emotions that interact with their environment. With respect to the automation of
vehicles, both the cognitive-psychological processes of information processing and the
inﬂuence of higher mental structures (e.g. needs, expectations, wishes, etc.) are important.
The interdependency of these different levels has been emphasized in theoretical models
on the role of the driver in automated vehicles [e.g. 54, 55]. Ultimately the appropriate
modiﬁcation and adaptation of mental models will play a major role in determining the
nature and frequency of use, as well as the acceptance of these systems. The successful
transition—as yet undeﬁned—of the driver’s role in automated vehicles therefore requires
an integrative examination of the scholarship on human behavior in partially and highly
automated systems as well as the emergent ideas and requirements with regard to Full
Automation Using Driver for Extended Availabilities. Put another way, human centered
technology design implies not only a consideration of the technical possibilities and limits,
but also a focus on individual and societal values and objectives.
6.3
Mental Models of Autonomous Driving
Many people regard autonomous vehicles as a concept for the distant future. Though
many people may have imagined how appealing it would be to be able to sleep or read a
newspaper during a drive, knowledge about autonomous vehicles remains sparse among
the general population. Decisions regarding the use and acceptance of innovations,
however, are not based solely on rational knowledge [56]. Contrary to the notion of
humans as rational, beneﬁt-maximizing decision-makers—homo economicus—, humans
tend to employ simpler decision-making strategies which reduce the amount of infor-
mation to be processed and are inﬂuenced by emotional processes [57–59]. Attitudes and
decisions are not inﬁnitely amenable to change merely through the provision of more
information. Rather, new information is received and processed selectively so as to be in
agreement with existing desires, expectations and goals—the human’s mental models
[60]. It is therefore crucial to the success of an innovation that the cognitive perceptions
and evaluations of it can not only be integrated into existing mental models, but also
appeal to the emotional side of the equation [61, 62].
In addition to numerous studies on the technical, legal and cognitive aspects of the
automation of vehicles, to date there have been few studies that have examined the
preferences and expectations of potential users. In the largest representative international
survey on the subject to date [63], the focus was primarily on the acceptance of and
willingness to use automated vehicles. The results for Germany show that automated
vehicles are by a majority considered as a beneﬁcial technological advance. At the same
time, half of the respondents express fear regarding automated driving and doubt that the
technology will function reliably. In a comparison of multiple use scenarios, long highway
trips are most commonly mentioned as the preferred potential use of autonomous driving.
Interestingly, the authors ﬁnd a positive correlation between the acceptance of driver
6
The Interaction Between Humans and Autonomous Agents

assistance systems and acceptance towards automated driving. One potential explanation
for that could be that the formation of suitable mental models for the characteristics of
partially automated systems also has a positive impact on the acceptance level for higher
automation levels [see also 34].
Which attitudes and cognitive and emotional representations underpin the acceptance
or rejection of automated vehicles is still unknown. In addition to the aforementioned
cognitive-psychological requirements for the design of the human-machine interaction,
however, these factors represent an important prerequisite for the success of the trans-
formation in the transportation sector. The aim of the quasi-representative online survey
study introduced here was to generate a differentiated, to some extent explorative, picture
of the perceptions of autonomous driving across the use cases generated in the project.
The questionnaire was developed with the following overarching questions in mind:
“With which mental models do potential users encounter the new role of the driver in
autonomous vehicles?”; “Which automated elements of vehicle guidance are most
amenable to the mental models of the users?”; “Which control functions and intervention
options by the driver do potential users expect in autonomous vehicles and how can
acceptance of this line of innovation be increased?”; “Which experience and design
elements in autonomous vehicles can replace previous representations on the role of the
driver and thus increase acceptance of this line of innovation?”.
6.3.1
Methods
6.3.1.1 Questionnaire
The questionnaire was devised in collaboration with other authors of this book
(Ms. Cyganski, topic: demand modeling; Ms. Fraedrich and Ms. Lenz, topic: acceptance).
The survey was conducted online in April 2014 via an electronic questionnaire. The
questionnaire was divided into two main sections: (1) General part: This part consisted
of ﬁve question groups: socio-demographic questions; questions on prior knowledge,
interest and general acceptance of automated driving; questions on need-related attitudes
regarding various forms of transportation; questions on the emotional representations of
mobility-related concepts; and questions on the topic of time-use and general trans-
portation usage. (2) Special part: The questions in this part related to the four use cases
developed in the project and were divided into the following ten topic groups: Free
associations on the use case; willingness to use the technology; anticipated use scenario;
anticipated impact on prior transportation usage; assumed fulﬁllment of need; emotional
reactions; trust and acceptance; need for control and intervention; and preferred secondary
tasks during automated driving. To reduce the processing time, the questions regarding the
four different use cases (see below) in the second part were not answered by all partici-
pants. After answering the questions in the ﬁrst part, the sample was split and the study
participants randomly assigned in equal numbers (N = 250 in each case) to one of the four
use cases. The questionnaire comprised 438 items, with each participant answering 210
110
I. Wolf
questions following distribution of the use cases. The survey questions were partly taken
from earlier mobility surveys [62, 64] and partly new and were—in particular the ques-
tions from part two—checked for comprehensibility in a pretest.
For all attitude questions, a six-point scale was used (1 = Completely disagree,
6 = Completely agree; with some questions, the codes differed due to the content) to
assess agreement with the statement. The affective signiﬁcance of the terms in the ﬁeld of
mobility was surveyed using the semantic differential method [65]. In the three dimen-
sions of valence, potency and arousal, bi-polar, nine-point (from -4 = extremely to
0 = neutral to 4 = extremely) scales were used in which the extremes were designated by
the adjectives unpleasant–pleasant (valence), weak–powerful (potency), and calming–
exciting (arousal). Current trafﬁc behavior was recorded via selection options and fre-
quency categories.
6.3.1.2 Sample
Participants were recruited through a commercial market research panel of the company,
Respondi AG (http://www.respondi.com/de/), and paid by the same for their partici-
pation. The company assembled a participant group that was representative of the
overall German population with respect to age, gender, education and income. A total of
N = 1,363 people completed the survey in its entirety. Some people, however, answered
the questions in such a short time that it doubtful that the questions were answered
conscientiously. As a consequence, all participants whose processing time was less than
1,000 s were not included in further analysis. The sample was therefore reduced by N =
230 to N = 1133. In a further step, the distortion of the original ratios that resulted from
the exclusion was corrected by removing N = 133 randomly selected females to achieve
a roughly representative distribution at least with respect to gender proportionality. The
average processing time of the remaining sample (N = 1000) was 1897 s (=31.6 min.)
(SD = 780 s). The precise demographic composition of the sample can be taken from
Table 6.1.
6.3.1.3 Data Analysis Affective Similarity
The affective similarity between the terms evaluated via the semantic differential method
was calculated as follows using the three-dimensional Euclidian distance d between the
average EPA proﬁle (E = valence, P = potence, A = arousal) of the term “ideal drive” and
the average EPA proﬁles of the other terms:
d ¼

whereas I refers to the evaluation of the “ideal drive,” B the respective evaluation of the
other terms and the subscript letters deﬁne the EPA dimensions.

Results
The ﬁrst line of inquiry was to what degree the topic of autonomous driving is even
known among the general public, whether there is broad interest and how people spon-
taneously feel about the technology. Less than half of respondents (44 %) claimed to have
no knowledge of the subject, while the majority had already heard of it (33 %), read about
it (16 %) or claimed to have a higher level of expertise (4 %). A similar distribution was
found in regard to interest in the subject of autonomous driving. A majority of participants

(58 %) described themselves as “somewhat,” “quite” or “very” interested in the subject.
However, a majority (56 %) also cannot imagine replacing their current preferred means
of transportation with an autonomous vehicle. Thus in spite of a relatively high degree of
interest and some prior knowledge, a majority of the public manifests a certain reluctance
towards the use of autonomous vehicles.
6.3.2.1 Driver Assistance Systems and Giving up Driving
Responsibilities
As discussed above, the use and acceptance of driver assistance systems can have a
positive effect on the general perception of autonomous driving. The results of the present
study show that most respondents (67 %) have already heard of driver assistance systems.
Among people who use a passenger car on a daily basis (82 %), cruise control (50 %),
acoustic parking assistants (46 %) and high-beam assistants are the most frequently used
systems. Other systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC, 15 %), night vision
assistant (11 %), head-up display (10 %) or attention assistant (8 %) are only used by a
minority in everyday situations.
The expressed desire to give up certain driving tasks and functions to an automated
system yields similar results. Figure 6.1 shows the task-speciﬁc distribution of desires in
the category spectrum from “absolutely not” to “very willingly.” In a comparison of the
different driving tasks it becomes clear that aside from the overwhelming rejection (62 %
in the categories “absolutely not” and “preferably not”) of the idea of completely ceding
vehicle control to a driving robot, people are particularly averse to giving up the task of
steering the vehicle (58.3 % in the categories “absolutely not” and “preferably not”) to an
automated system. At the same time, respondents view transferring parking tasks (45 % in
the categories “willingly” and “very willingly”) as well as safety-related assistance in the
area of vehicle stabilization (43 % in the categories “willingly” and “very willingly”) and
pedestrian recognition (43 % in the categories “willingly” and “very willingly”) more
favorably.

6.3.2.2 Representations of the Driver’s Role and Use Cases
Employing the semantic differential method, the study surveyed the affective signiﬁcance
of various terms related to different roles in the vehicle and the scenarios described in the
use cases among all participants. The concept of the “ideal drive” and the conventional
“car” were also evaluated in this fashion. The raw results (average evaluations on the
scales valence, potency and activation) are displayed in Table 6.2.
The results were used to calculate the Euclidian distances and thus the affective sim-
ilarity between the term “ideal drive” and the other terms (for methodological details see [
61, 66]). A visualization of these calculations is provided by Fig. 6.2, in which the
Euclidian distance d of the evaluated terms is represented on the x-axis. Low values
indicate a smaller distance and thus higher affective similarity between the terms, i.e. they
elicit a stronger positive association for the respondents. It is clearly evident that
“chauffeur” comes closest to “ideal drive” from an affective standpoint, while “co-pilot”
least corresponds to this emotional representation. In a comparison of the various use
cases for autonomous driving, it emerges quite clearly that the Vehicle-on-Demand
concept deviates most strongly from the idea of an ideal drive, while vehicles with
Autonomous Valet Parking are most closely associated with it. The signiﬁcantly more

positive affective positioning enjoyed by conventional cars in comparison to the use cases
could therefore represent a major impediment to acceptance with the introduction of Full
Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability in particular. As concerns the role of
the driver, the affective representations revealed in the study underscore the role prefer-
ence explicitly addressed in another question. In this item, participants use a slider to
indicate which role they would like to assume in an autonomous vehicle (1 = passenger
and 10 = supervisor). The arithmetic mean of 6.36 (SD = 2.9) indicates a preference for
the role of an active supervisor who is able to maintain control over the vehicle at all times
based on continuously available system information. On the affective level, the role of the
passive passenger (d = 2.1) is still visibly remote from the desired ideal (d = 0).
6.3.2.3 Cognitive and Emotional Representations of the Use Cases
As described above, the overall sample in this part of the questionnaire was randomly
divided into four subgroups of equal size (each N = 250) and assigned to one of the four
use cases (Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability (1), Autonomous Valet
Parking (2), Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability (3) and Vehicle on
Demand (4)). This enabled an inter-group comparison of the expectations and attitudes
toward the individual scenarios. At the beginning of this section, participants were asked
about their willingness to use the brieﬂy described variants of autonomous driving.
Autonomous vehicles with valet parking were the most popular (53 %), followed by Full
Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability (45 %) and Interstate Pilot Using
Driver for Extended Availability (42 %). The lowest intent to use was registered by the
Vehicle-on-Demand concept (35 %). According to the conducted analysis of variance
(ANOVA), the differences are statistically signiﬁcant (F(3996) = 4.528; p < 0.01). The
Bonferroni post hoc test (pairwise average value comparison) indicates, however, that
only the Autonomous-Valet-Parking and Vehicle-on-Demand use cases differ signiﬁ-
cantly in terms of intent to use (p < 0.01).
In response to the question to what extent various mobility needs would be fulﬁlled
through the use of an autonomous vehicle, some differing assessments emerge in a
comparison of the four scenarios. Table 6.3 shows the averages of these evaluations and
statistical results (ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test). From an overall perspective, it
can be seen that autonomous vehicles are perceived as convenient, stress-free and envi-
ronmentally friendly. Statistically relevant differences in comparing the use cases arise
with regard to (lack of) stress, convenience, safety and time-savings. According to
respondents’ assessments, Autonomous Valet Parking most effectively addresses the need
to save time, convenience, freedom from stress and thus explains the high acceptance for
this variant of autonomous driving. From a critical standpoint, the safety concerns related
to the Vehicle-on-Demand use case stand out.
The emotional evaluation of the use cases was conducted with regard to 10 different
emotions (hopefulness, relaxation, satisfaction, happiness, concern, anger, stress, pow-
erlessness, dislike, fear). The participants were asked to indicate which emotions they
would experience in the anticipated use of the respective variant of autonomous driving.

The Interaction Between Humans and Autonomous Agents
115
The results (see Table 6.4) conﬁrm the tendencies found in the differences that emerged in
the comparison of the use cases described above. The strongest positive associations were
found in connection with Autonomous Valet Parking. The feelings of satisfaction,
relaxation and happiness are also signiﬁcantly more strongly represented here than in the
other scenarios. In the use cases Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability,
Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability and Vehicle on Demand, the
emotions of powerlessness and fear dominate. The feeling of being at the mercy of forces
beyond one’s control is associated with these feelings and represents a major hurdle to
acceptance. Aside from Autonomous Valet Parking, only Full Automation Using Driver
for Extended Availability evokes above-average positive emotions such as happiness,
hopefulness and satisfaction, although the negative emotions do predominate in this use
case.

These results provide a differentiated picture of the emotional base elements out of
which the most important emotion in the ﬁeld of automation is comprised—trust. Trust in
the described variants of autonomous driving was measured in this survey based on four
items (e.g. “I can imagine relying on such a system in my everyday mobility”)—analo-
gous to the other attitude items on a 6-point Likert scale. A totals index was composed
based on these items. As expected, trust is highest in vehicles with Autonomous Valet
Parking (M = 3.45; SD = 1.31) and lowest for the Vehicle-on-Demand concept (M = 3.10;
SD = 1.42). Trust in vehicles with Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability
and full automated vehicles is roughly on the same value (M = 3.36; SD = 1.33 against
M = 3.28; SD = 1.33). Only the differences between the Autonomous-Valet-Parking and

Vehicle-on-Demand scenarios (Bonferroni post hoc test, p < 0.05) are statistically
signiﬁcant.
6.3.2.4 Intervention, Control and Experience Needs
For a clear majority of those surveyed (Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability: 82 %; Autonomous Valet Parking: 81 %; Full Automation Using Driver for
Extended Availability: 88 %; Vehicle on Demand: 84 %), the possibility of reassuming
control of the vehicle or terminating the automated driving procedure at any time is one of
the central needs. At the same time, in the scenarios with an available driver (Interstate
Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability: 32 %; Full Automation Using Driver for
Extended Availability: 48 %), only a minority would wish to cease paying attention to
trafﬁc and completely cede control of the vehicle to the automated system. This is also
reﬂected in the need expressed by majorities for both of these use cases of not wishing to
change the conventional seating position during automated driving (Interstate Pilot Using
Driver for Extended Availability: 76 %; Full Automation Using Driver for Extended
Availability: 79 %). In all four scenarios, the majority of participants expressed the desire
to be able to adjust the automated system to reﬂect personal preferences in terms of
driving style (e.g. comfortable vs. sporty) and route selection (e.g. fastest vs. most
environmentally friendly; Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability: 71 %;
Autonomous Valet Parking: 76 %; Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Avail-
ability: 72 %; Vehicle on Demand: 82 %).
The most important perceived beneﬁt of using autonomous vehicles is the possibility of
enjoying the landscape during the drive (Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability: 64 %; Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability: 72 %;
Vehicle on Demand: 72 %; Autonomous Valet Parking: NA). The option of being able to
converse unhindered with other vehicle occupants continues to be viewed highly posi-
tively (Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability: 63 %; Full Automation
Using Driver for Extended Availability: 65 %; Vehicle on Demand: 68 %; Autonomous
Valet Parking: NA). Astonishingly, activities such as surﬁng the internet (Interstate Pilot
Using Driver for Extended Availability: 28 %; Full Automation Using Driver for
Extended Availability: 39 %; Vehicle on Demand: 46 %; Autonomous Valet Parking:
NA), viewing ﬁlms (Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability: 23 %; Full
Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability: 32 %; Vehicle on Demand: 36 %;
Autonomous Valet Parking: NA), working (Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability: 22 %; Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability: 33 %;
Vehicle on Demand: 36.4 %; Autonomous Valet Parking: NA) or relaxing or sleeping
(Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability: 31 %; Full Automation Using
Driver for Extended Availability: 47 %; Vehicle on Demand: 54 %; Autonomous Valet
Parking: NA) are only regarded as positive aspects of autonomous driving by a minority.
The most important beneﬁts of Autonomous Valet Parking are seen to be simplifying the
search for parking spaces (80 %), the safety of the parking location (78 %), the resulting
free time (76 %) and the cheaper parking options outside of the inner city areas (76 %).

Summary and Conclusions
The focus of this chapter has been the interaction between humans and autonomous
vehicles. Proceeding on the assumption that automated vehicles will for the foreseeable
future depend upon the availability and control of the human, we ﬁrst looked at the
cognitive-psychological effects of the human-machine interaction. This was followed by
an empirical study of the user perspective on autonomous driving through an extensive
online survey. The study focused in particular on the attitudes, expectations and emotions
—the mental models—toward the subject of autonomous driving.
Based on the scholarship thus far on the psychological consequences of automation in
different domains (e.g. aviation, production), it may be concluded that as we proceed
towards Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability, designers and devel-
opers would do well to place greater emphasis on the human at the core of their endeavors.
Even in the partially automated systems available today, drivers display well-known
problems such as excessive trust and reduced situation awareness. The long-term effects of
higher degrees of automation and the associated lengthier periods of mental decoupling
from the task on the cognitive and motor skills required by drivers are still largely
unknown. The effects found in this regard for highly trained and experiences airplane
pilots, however, are alarming [38]. Training and regular manual execution of automatable
driving tasks thus seem to be an important instrument for maintaining required and desired
skills of the driver.
As long as the human is a part of the availability concept of automated vehicles—
whether as a supervisor of the system or taking over the driving task—both the human and
the machine need a suitable representation of the respective other agent. Transparent
interfaces adapted to the mental system of the human are the prerequisite for the necessary
situation and system awareness in interactions with the automated system. On the other
hand, the technical system must also be able to correctly interpret the mental state of the
driver, her intentions and behavior and dynamically represent them in a driver model. In
adaptive and cooperative design concepts, these aspects have already been implemented in
highly automated vehicle prototypes [44, 67]. Moreover, vehicle manufacturers and
research institutions are currently working on potential solutions to these problems in a
range of different projects (www.adaptive-ip.eu; www.incarin.de; www.urban-online.org).
The survey results highlight some emerging contradictions between what is technically
feasible and innovations that are actually desired by the public. Although a majority of
drivers has become accustomed to handing over certain driving tasks (e.g. cruise control)
to assistance systems, most people are highly averse to the idea of actually letting go of
the steering wheel. The current cognitive and affective representations of the role of the
driver are still very strongly associated with the conventional image of an active chauffeur.
The notion of assuming the role of a passive passenger ﬁnds little acceptance. The
conventional, manually controlled vehicle is still so strongly associated with the ideal
image in the public mind that for the majority, completely autonomous vehicles do not
fulﬁll mobility needs. The open question is whether a step-by-step, evolutionary
6

119
automation of vehicles can achieve the requisite changes to the mental models associated
with role expectations in autonomous vehicles. A situation-speciﬁc transfer of driving
tasks to the autonomous vehicle may, as the example of the high acceptance rates illus-
trates, represent a more fruitful alternative.
Moreover, the results of the survey offer ideas on possible strategies for the transfor-
mation that take their orientation from the needs and emotions of potential users. The main
argument for the introduction of autonomous vehicles in previous public debates has been
increased road trafﬁc safety. This perception is not shared by the general public, however.
Rather, the participants in this study see the beneﬁts of autonomous vehicles as stress
reduction, convenience and environmental friendliness. At the same time, associated
emotions such as powerlessness and fear are powerful factors that pose a major imped-
iment to acceptance. The human thinking apparatus is not capable of objectively esti-
mating the risk of rare events [58], so fears and concerns can lead to irrational decisions.
From this perspective, user-centered development means taking account of existing needs
both in terms of communication and the concrete design of the systems.
For the potential user, the question is ultimately the added value of an autonomous
vehicle compared to the still highly regarded manually controlled vehicle. What should be
the focus of one’s attention if one is no longer required, or indeed able, to concern oneself
with the control of the vehicle for safety reasons? Contrary to expectations, a majority of
participants was not interested in the extended range of infotainment options from internet
to television, but instead preferred to enjoy the landscape uninterrupted. Just how stable
and valid these assertions prove to be in concrete interactions with automated vehicles will
have to be addressed in future studies. But perhaps this need follows in the tradition of
German romanticism and will offer a new impetus for the design of an automated, “close
to nature” space.

Problems Between Autonomous Vehicles
and Human Drivers

7.1
Introduction
Discussions of autonomous land vehicles often invoke the example of air trafﬁc, where the
autopilot is responsible for steering except for take-off and landing. The question arises:
what can we learn from air trafﬁc? What autonomously ﬂying aircraft and autonomously
driving vehicles have in common is that the pilot or driver bears the ﬁnal responsibility.
But, there are a number of differences between road trafﬁc and air trafﬁc (besides their
type of locomotion) that make transferring the systems from one to the other impractical.
Two key differences that are central to this article are the application of rules and the form
of supervision. Encounters between airplanes—primarily while taxiing—are thoroughly
governed by strict rules. In addition, there is a supervisory monitoring and guiding
authority that gives pilots precise instructions and, in cases that might not be covered by
rules, reaches decisions and communicates with pilots. As such, the pilot does not have
any room for discretion or independent decision-making. The pilot’s role is purely
implementation. Unlike air trafﬁc, road trafﬁc is a self-organizing, chaotic system that,
although it is fundamentally governed by rules, includes many situations for which
unambiguous rules cannot be determined. In those situations, section 1 of the German
Highway Code always applies: “Participating in road trafﬁc requires constant caution and
mutual consideration,” and “Those who participate in trafﬁc shall behave such that no one
else is harmed, endangered, or even disabled or harassed more than inevitable in the
circumstances.” Thus, even a list of rules for behavior and all conceivable situations as
exhaustive as the Highway Code has a large “miscellaneous” category that must be

resolved by road users themselves in accordance with section 1 of the Highway Code. It
follows that one of a driver’s central responsibilities in order to safely participate in road
trafﬁc is to assess other road users’ behavior. This assessment and prediction of other road
users’ behavior relies on the initial assumption of more or less rule-abiding behavior on
their part. However, another aspect of evaluating intentions involves communication
between drivers and road users via actions and gestures. In other words, in addition to the
“ofﬁcial” rules, there exists a set of informal rules that help to guide trafﬁc.
Anyone who has visited another country as a tourist, whether as a driver or a pedes-
trian, has experienced for themselves how drastically informal rules, culturally speciﬁc
modes of behavior, and communication between road users affect trafﬁc. Human drivers
who encounter such divergent “canons of rules” initially react with a phase of irritation. In
the second phase, the adaptation phase, they unconsciously adapt over time to these new
imprecise and unwritten rules. In the consolidation phase these rules seem to be obvious
although they are not set in stone and in some cases cannot even be precisely described.
Motorized road trafﬁc comprises a system with very diverse players whose goal is to
convey road users to their destinations safely, quickly, and without incident. From the
systemic perspective, it is immediately evident that observance of informal rules, com-
munication between road users, and predictions of others’ behavior fulﬁll two key
functions: they facilitate the ﬂow of trafﬁc and help to compensate for errors.
7.2
Questions
Expressed technically, humans are multi-sensory adaptive systems. That means that they
are capable of taking signals that might be weak or ambiguous and extrapolating the big
picture, which they can then interpret. They are also able to adapt to changing conditions
in order to support the two aforementioned functions, compensating for one another’s
errors and improving the ﬂow of trafﬁc. Yet what happens when, alongside humans, there
are also robotic vehicles participating in trafﬁc that abide strictly by rules but do not
understand informal rules or aspects of communication? How would human drivers react
to these new road users, especially in the transition phase when robotic vehicles remain a
minority? Are humans capable of solving difﬁcult or seemingly unresolvable situations in
cooperation with robotic vehicles? Finally, which characteristics or markings do robotic
vehicles need to have at the minimum in order to participate in mixed trafﬁc with human
drivers without causing problems?
This article will approach these questions from various angles. Since autonomous
vehicles have so far primarily been investigated in view of technical performance, as in
the Urban Challenge [1] or the Bertha Benz drive [2], and an emergency driver has always
been present in mixed trafﬁc to intervene if necessary (e.g. at the Stadtpilot [3]), there is
scarcely any original literature on the questions described above. For that reason, much
will be extrapolated from the ﬁndings of other research ﬁelds.

7.3
How do Road Users Communicate?
In addition to the standard signals for expressing an intention, such as turn signals,
emergency lights, brake lights, the horn, and headlight ﬂashing, road users communicate
via a number of “informal” communication channels. This kind of communication in road
trafﬁc is characterized by restricted comprehensibility compared to normal human com-
munication. According to Merten [4], there are various communication options.
Schema Formation
In schema formation, a road user’s behavior is anticipated based on speciﬁc character-
istics. For example, an elderly person with mobility issues behaves differently from a
child. One expects different driving behavior from the driver of a sports car to that of the
driver of a large sedan. Of course, these schemata are not always accurate in day-to-day
driving. Nevertheless, they do serve as guiding principles and help to stabilize the entire
system of trafﬁc.
Anticipatory Behavior
Small actions make the direction of someone’s behavior predictable for other road users.
For example, if a vehicle approaches the left lane (without engaging the turn signal), this
indicates an intention to change lanes. Similarly, if a pedestrian purposefully approaches a
crosswalk, the driver will assume that the pedestrian would like to cross the street.
Non-verbal Communication
Non-verbal communication plays a role among the informal communication channels,
especially in “negotiation situations.” Non-verbal communication is indubitably the oldest
form of communication between living beings. As far back as 1874, Charles Darwin
discussed non-verbal communication in his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man
and Animals [5]. The subtlety of non-verbal signals was demonstrated by an old inves-
tigation by Pfungst [6] of Clever Hans, a horse that was able to perform “arithmetic” based
on unconscious, minimal signals from its owner or the audience. The important ﬁnding
was that non-verbal signals are even sent out unconsciously and are thus not always easily
available for analysis.
In general, non-verbal signals can be divided into three types:
• Facial expression and eye contact
• Gestures and body movements
• Voice and tone of speech.
In the case of road trafﬁc, only facial expression/eye contact and gestures/body
movements are relevant and will therefore be addressed here.
7
Communication and Communication Problems …
127
Facial expressions and eye contact
In local trafﬁc, eye contact both between drivers and between drivers and other road users
(pedestrians and cyclists) plays a critical role. Pedestrians who want to cross the street
without a crossing aid use eye contact to ensure that an approaching driver sees them. If
the driver returns the eye contact, pedestrians assume that they have been seen and that the
driver will act accordingly [7].
When a driver from a side street wants to merge onto a main street with heavier trafﬁc,
the merging driver also uses eye contact to make sure he or she can turn despite the short
time gap, as the driver on the busier street will reduce speed accordingly.
Eye contact is a two-way form of communication. In other words, a glance is either
reciprocated or not reciprocated by the person who is glanced at. If that person looks
away, this sends the message that he or she has “not seen” the other person and does not
intend to accept the signal or the negotiation. The implications of the strategy for
autonomous vehicles should be distinguished between autonomous vehicles in which the
driver’s seat is occupied and those where it is not.
If the driver’s seat is occupied, there are two possibilities:
1. The “driver,” i.e. the person in the driver’s seat, is preoccupied with other activities
inside the vehicle and eye contact does not occur. In that case, the other road user
cannot assume that their negotiation proposal has been accepted and will act
accordingly.
2. The “driver” of the autonomous vehicle is looking outside and makes incidental eye
contact with the other road user. In that case the eye contact with non-autonomous road
user can lead to an inaccurate understanding of the situation and thus cause a conﬂict.
If the driver’s seat is not occupied, the other road user does not receive any infor-
mation, so the situation is equivalent to the “no eye contact” scenario.
Gestures and body movements
Gestures are a pervasive and effective method of communication between road users.
Many signals conveyed using gestures are generally comprehensible and mostly clear. For
instance, nodding signiﬁes agreement with the other person’s request. Pedestrians move
their arms up and down to request vehicles to stop, for instance in order to secure the
scene of an accident. Moving one’s hands downwards (Fig. 7.1) signiﬁes that the other
person should slow down. A sweeping hand movement (Fig. 7.2) or a gesture of offering
(Fig. 7.3) with the palm facing upward signiﬁes “Go ahead. I cede my right-of-way.”

Implications of Communications Options on Traffic Safety
At ﬁrst glance, informal signals such as eye contact, gestures, or anticipatory behavior
seem less clear-cut than standardized signals such as turn signals, the horn, headlight
ﬂashing, etc. In fact neither is entirely clear-cut. Interestingly, the philosopher Heidegger,
who investigates the nature of symbols in his treatise Being and Time [9], chooses cars as
an example: “Motor cars are equipped with an adjustable red arrow whose position

indicates which direction the car will take, for example, at an intersection” (cit. after
Frerichs, [10], p. 138. Perhaps this symbol was still crystal-clear and situation-
independent in those early days of cars, but it quickly becomes apparent that symbols
take on different meanings in different contexts. All symbols, both verbal and non-verbal,
can only be understood in relation to their context. As Savigny [11] explains, a distinction
must be made between the signal and the intended meaning. Headlight ﬂashing may have
different intended meanings depending on the situation. If a driver who has right-of-way
slows down and ﬂashes her headlights, it is interpreted as an offer to yield right-of-way; if
she is accelerating or maintaining speed when she makes the same signal, it means that
she is asserting her right-of-way. Likewise, a right-turn signal might mean “I’m turning”
or “I’m looking for a parking space—go ahead and pass me.”
To consider the vulnerable road users, let us take a look at the interesting example of
cyclists. Cyclists still use signals from the early days of motorized driving to indicate their
intended change in direction. This means that for pattern recognition outside of highway
trafﬁc, an automated system needs the ability to identify both cyclists’ presence and the
signals they make.
What are the implications for trafﬁc safety? Initially we may assume that autonomous
vehicles will not be familiar with the assorted context-dependent meanings of signals and
must therefore behave very cautiously. As long as visual recognition or a pedestrian’s
hand signals cannot be reliably perceived and interpreted based on the situation, any
pedestrians located on a potential collision course with the vehicle must be treated as
hazards and trigger a suitable reaction by the autonomous vehicle.
So when autonomous vehicles identify pedestrians on the roadway, they will
stop. What happens if the pedestrian is a police ofﬁcer directing trafﬁc? For one thing, the
police ofﬁcer must be identiﬁed as an upright obstacle that the robotic vehicle must steer
around. Beyond that, though, the vehicle needs to interpret the police ofﬁcer’s signals. If
the police ofﬁcer holds strictly to the rules, as shown in the photographs Figs. 7.4 and 7.5,
an autonomous vehicle can learn the associated meanings. Experience has shown, how-
ever, that police ofﬁcers directing trafﬁc or parking lot attendants assigning parking spaces
use very dynamic gestures to speed up trafﬁc, such as waving their arms or hands or
making rowing motions with their arms. See Figs. 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8. Humans usually
understand these signals from context. Alongside the ability to recognize patterns of
gestures and postures, autonomous vehicles would need to have contextual knowledge
allowing them to identify and evaluate gestures correctly.
One exceptional case is the need to accommodate vehicles with special rights, such as
police cars, ﬁre trucks, or ambulances. These vehicles draw attention to themselves using
auditory signals. Visual and auditory signals (such as sirens and ﬂashing lights) obligate
the rest of trafﬁc to stop, cede right of way at an intersection, or move aside to create a
rescue lane. In everyday road trafﬁc, vehicles do not stop right away when they hear this
type of auditory signal in the distance. Such a reaction would severely inconvenience
trafﬁc, especially near a hospital for instance. It is also impossible from a distance to
precisely identify the direction the auditory signal is coming from. Likewise, the

functionality to identify special vehicles from a distance and to determine the best way to
rearrange the lanes would be difﬁcult to design. For that reason, autonomous vehicles
would need to stop upon all of these signals for safety reasons so as not to put trafﬁc in
danger. The following section will delve more deeply into the implications of the above
on public acceptance.
7.5
Is the Ability to Communicate a Requirement for the Other
Road Users to Accept Autonomous Vehicles?
In terms of public acceptance, we must once realize again the effect of informal com-
munication in “negotiating situations.” In keeping with the aforementioned Sect. 1 of the
Highway Code, drivers communicate in negotiating situations in order to resolve situa-
tions that are rule-governed in principle but where blindly following the rules would
disturb trafﬁc considerably.
Example 1
If a vehicle is parking or idling in your lane, it is sometimes necessary to cross over to the
opposite lane and, in extreme cases, even to cross a solid center line. In busy trafﬁc, this
Fig. 7.8 Police officer
(Sweden) gestures to vehicle to
move forward. Image rights:

7
Communication and Communication Problems …
133
requires coordinating with the oncoming vehicles. Apart from (unauthorized) crossing of
the solid center line, the situation can be solved without a “negotiation” if oncoming trafﬁc
becomes sparse enough that the opposite lane can be used without vehicles communi-
cating. The busier the trafﬁc, the more likely a negotiation is necessary.
How does the driver of an oncoming vehicle signal willingness to cooperate? First of
all, by slowing down in order to leave room for you to cross onto the opposite lane. Yet in
most cases slowing down alone is not enough of a signal because there are many reasons
why a vehicle might keep a larger-than-usual following distance. That is why approaching
drivers would usually signal this kind of offer by both slowing down and ﬂashing their
headlights. If the autonomous vehicle did not recognize this signal, it would be seen as a
“trafﬁc obstacle,” which would certainly not encourage public acceptance.
Example 2
As shown above, autonomous vehicles will generally behave more cautiously than human
drivers as they have a limited grasp of the context and informal signals. Yet they can also
perform driving maneuvers that are normally not performed by a human driver. For one
thing, they react more quickly than human drivers. Since they tend not to have a “moment
of shock,” their reaction time is much faster. That is one reason why autonomous vehicles
would cause fewer accidents. Furthermore, accident research has shown that many drivers
do not make the most of their cars’ braking capabilities and, even when swerving, tend not
to reach the physical limits based on the circle of forces. Driver assistance systems such as
automatic emergency brakes or emergency steer assist are intended to compensate for
these deﬁciencies. On that basis, not only would an autonomous vehicle act more quickly
in an emergency situation, but it would be able to take advantage of the physical limits of
forward and lateral acceleration. How other road users will react is largely unknown at this
point. The following section discusses a simple approach to solving this.
7.6
What Mental Model Will Other Road Users Apply When
Reacting to Autonomous Vehicle’s Driving Errors?
Closely related to the questions of interaction and negotiation discussed earlier is the issue
of compensating for other road user’s errors. Apart from avoiding immediate collisions
with swerving trajectories, accommodating other driver’s errors is normal in everyday
road trafﬁc. First let us clarify how “driving errors” is deﬁned. From a human driver’s
perspective, “driving errors” might include purely rule-abiding behavior that is not ideally
adapted to the situation.
For example, a human-driven car with right-of-way on a main road might let an
autonomous vehicle from a side street turn ﬁrst if the human-driven car wouldn’t other-
wise be able to turn onto the side street. In other words, if the human driver yields despite
134
B. Färber
having right-of-way, the autonomous vehicle would need the ability to recognize that
reliably.
Driving errors might also result from deﬁciencies in the autonomous vehicle’s reper-
toire of strategies for resolving special situations or might be caused by reaching system
boundaries.
Example
An autonomous vehicle operating in “trafﬁc jam pilot” mode enters a safe state because
the system’s boundaries have been reached. In other words, the vehicle slows down to a
stop. Although slowing down to a stop is common in a trafﬁc jam, the other road users will
be confused at the least if all other vehicles are moving and only the autonomous vehicle
is stopped. If the maneuver occurs fairly abruptly for a reason that other drivers do not
understand, this can pose a danger. However, we should keep in mind that road users do
not drive without errors either in current road trafﬁc and other drivers usually compensate
for their errors. This raises the question of which characteristics humans will ascribe to
autonomous vehicles. Will they be seen as less competent than human drivers or treated as
ﬂawless machines?
One goal of a deployment strategy must be to disseminate a positive yet realistic
conception of autonomous vehicles among all road users. Then, and only then, will
autonomous vehicles play an appropriate role in the trafﬁc system. In general, the con-
ditions for this are in place. For example, surveys of new technologies such as robotics
have shown that Europeans have positive attitudes towards robots [12]. Likewise, driver
assistance systems—as precursors of highly automated and ultimately autonomous
vehicles—already enjoy a strong reputation as useful aids and are seeing increasing
demand from consumers [13].
Apart from people’s general attitudes towards technological systems, the capabilities
and characteristics ascribed to new technological systems depend on the user’s level of
background knowledge. People who are less well-versed technically tend to apply naïve
behavioral models that ascribe more capabilities to technological systems than they
actually possess. Current demonstrations of autonomous vehicles in the media, largely
conducted for marketing purposes, invite the impression that these vehicles are masters of
all situations. This raises the expectations of autonomous vehicles so high that any driving
errors would cause at least irritation, if not safety concerns. For that reason, in order to
generate a realistic understanding of potential issues, it is essential to publicize autono-
mous vehicles’ capabilities and limitations early on.
7
Communication and Communication Problems …
135
7.7
Cultural Differences
A number of questions arise related to cultural differences: Are there universal rules for
non-verbal behavior that can simply be adapted? How can cultural differences in com-
munication and expectations be reﬂected in a robotic vehicle’s communicative and
decision-making behavior? If they can, how can they be adapted? What modes of
behavior are there in different countries?
The best-known culturally comparative studies on non-verbal “utterances” based on
facial expressions were produced by Ekman [14]. Across cultures, he found common
facial expressions for the basic emotions of fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise,
anger, and contempt.
Most of these basic emotions do appear in road trafﬁc, but their signiﬁcance for
communication among vehicles is rather restricted. For instance, the gestures for yes and
no are crucial in negotiation situations. In central and northern Europe as well as the US,
nodding means “yes” and shaking one’s head means “no.” However, in countries such as
India, Pakistan, and Bulgaria, wobbling one’s head sideways, a motion akin to the
European and American “no” gesture, actually signiﬁes agreement. Finally, there is an
additional way to indicate yes and no non-verbally in countries such as Greece, Turkey,
and southern Italy. “‘Yes’ is expressed by tilting the head forward, while ‘no’ is indicated
by tilting it back” ([15], p. 134). Beckoning gestures are another source of misunder-
standings during interactions among road users. A “paddling gesture” [15] with the palm
facing down is used in Japan and the Mediterranean region for beckoning. In Germany
and the UK, the same gesture is used to mean “go away.” Despite the cultural differences
among non-verbal signals performed with the hands, the gestures used to insult or rebuke
other people in road trafﬁc are largely universal, interestingly enough. Raising an index
ﬁnger (Fig. 7.9), tapping on one’s temple (Fig. 7.10) or making a sweeping motion
beginning at the temple (Fig. 7.11) conveys one’s contempt for the recipient. One
exception is that forming an upright circle with one’s thumb and index ﬁnger means
(mostly) “o.k.”in Germany, whereas in Italy it is understood as a gesture of insult (ass-
hole) (Fig. 7.12).
In contrast to the pan-cultural basic emotions and “gestures of frustration,” there are
certainly cultural differences in informal communication among road users that are
expressed in driving behavior and are currently in ﬂux.
It is generally agreed that southern Europeans drive both more assertively and more
defensively than central Europeans. In southern Europe, acceleration and the horn act as
informal signals among vehicles. A driver merges into a lane of trafﬁc by accelerating
rapidly into a gap (potentially while honking the horn), expecting that the other road users
will yield. The driver does not expect any other feedback, but simply assumes that the
intention to merge will be recognized and accepted.
In central or northern Europe, the driver of the merging vehicle would tend to expect
feedback in the form of eye contact at the least, if not a nod or a hand gesture. In Germany,

137
at any rate, it is commonplace to insist on one’s right-of-way so it would be unusual to
attempt to merge without obtaining the other road user’s “consent,” as that would involve
risking a collision.
Trafﬁc in the United States is characterized by more steady, lane-based driving. Aside
from the ofﬁcial signals, informal signals play less of a role there.
Trafﬁc in China is—at least so far—marked by a low level of rule-abidance and by
communication that is difﬁcult for foreigners to interpret. Chinese drivers are masters of
surprise, ignoring trafﬁc rules and honking merely as a “friendly greeting” [16].
Communication between cars and pedestrians is especially critical.
Pedestrians make themselves understood by gesturing with their hands, stepping onto
the crosswalk, or waiting there until a car stops. What are the implications of this for the
behavior of autonomous vehicles? For one thing, autonomous vehicles will predict
whether a pedestrian intends to cross the street based on the pedestrian’s trajectory and
acceleration. Apart from that, there are other modes of behavior that are more ambiguous,
such as standing at a crosswalk without intending to cross (e.g. while having a conver-
sation) or hesitating without making a clear signal of intending to cross. In all of these
cases, the autonomous vehicle will need to stop for safety reasons. A consequence of this
may be “unwarranted stopping” or the danger that children or teens catch on and begin to
force vehicles to stop at crosswalks for fun.

person’s behavior. Image rights: copyright belongs to author

Yet the regulations and the actual behavior alike vary widely from country to country.
For instance, Italy did not have a rule requiring cars to stop at crosswalks until recently.
According to reports from visitors to China, it is only advisable to cross at a crosswalk
there as part of a crowd because trafﬁc is highly unlikely to stop for a lone pedestrian.
While pedestrians who use hand gestures to communicate assume that their gestures
are seen, they usually would not cross the street if an oncoming car did not slow down.
7.8
Means of Compensation
In the ﬁrst stage, there is an easy antidote to the dilemma of robotic vehicles’ inability to
communicate informally in “negotiation situations.”
Clearly and visibly marking autonomous vehicles as such would announce the vehi-
cles’ uniqueness to the other road users and make their deviant behavior more under-
standable. This would indicate to other road users that they cannot expect the usual
behavior and would consequently increase acceptance in the sample situations described
above. After all, vehicles for learner drivers are identiﬁed very visibly in order to inform
other road users and excuse behavior that might be either excessively rule-abiding or
overly hesitant.

Especially in the introductory phase, several considerations support including identi-
fying markings. If vehicles drive without a person sitting in the driver’s seat, as envisioned
by the “valet parking” scenario, this might irritate the other road users. “Is that car moving
autonomously or is it just driving out of control?” With identifying markings, there is no
need to ask. Marking autonomous vehicles can also have a marketing effect that will help
give rise to rapid adoption. For example, when ABS was introduced, there were ABS
stickers available that read “This vehicle has ABS brakes” to indicate that the braking
distance was shorter. Technically that is not quite correct because ABS mainly makes it
easier to steer while braking, but from a marketing viewpoint the sticker was a great
success.
There are also some reasons not to give autonomous vehicles identifying markings.
Because they must strictly adhere to the rules, due to their limited ability to negotiate
among other things, they might also be targets for unwanted external interventions.
A simple example:
Pedestrians would not cross a street if a car was approaching due to uncertainty as to
whether the car sees them or whether it will stop. In the case of an autonomous vehicle,
pedestrians can be positive that the vehicle will stop no matter what (within physical
limits). As a result, stopping autonomous cars could become a game for teenagers or cause
adults to cross the street without paying attention to the ﬂow of trafﬁc. “It has to stop—it’s
programmed that way.” Neither development would be good for the ﬂow of trafﬁc and
this would not have a positive affect on the acceptance of autonomous vehicles.
Whether it has an outright negative effect is hard to predict. That is highly dependent
on how exactly autonomous vehicles are introduced. If they are seen as a positive tech-
nological innovation and excused for having certain imperfections, a negative effect
would be scarcely likely. On the other hand, if they are seen as an elite status symbol,
envy will predominate and attempts to disrupt the system will be more common.
7.9
New Forms of Communication for an Effective Exchange
of Information from Both Psychological and Technological
Perspectives
Autonomous vehicles must generally be able to recognize and interpret other road users’
gestures and trajectories. In order to interpret them, they will need situational knowledge
allowing them to put signals in the correct context. The “ofﬁcial” signals such as turn
signals, the horn, and headlight ﬂashing would probably sufﬁce in most situations in order
to convey information to other vehicles or road users.
Kent Larsen’s research group at MIT proposed an interesting approach for commu-
nication between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians [17]. A prototype with a variety of
sensors but only remotely resembling an actual car was ﬁtted with a number of devices.
Swiveling, blinking LEDs designed to look like an eye turn towards a pedestrian, sig-
naling “I’ve seen you.”
140
B. Färber
Additionally, directional speakers point towards pedestrians and tell them that it is
okay to cross the street.
If any pedestrians are identiﬁed, color-coded LEDs in the wheels could change from
green to yellow to red in order to acknowledge pedestrians or warn them (Fig. 7.13).
Another signal that autonomous vehicles can use to communicate with others is “ex-
plicit driving.”
For example, if another vehicle would like to merge and the autonomous vehicle wants
to cooperate, the autonomous vehicle should visibly slow down in order to accentuate the
gap and assure the other driver that it is safe to merge.
Communication and informal rules are in constant ﬂux. To illustrate this point with a
verbal example, take the expression that something “sucks.” Not too long ago, this word
was understood as a direct sexual reference, provoking understandable consternation
when young people began generalizing it. Similarly, the non-verbal signal “thumbs up”
recently spread to countries where it was unfamiliar due to its iconic use in social media.
From one angle, that means that autonomous vehicles will need to periodically learn new
signals of non-verbal behavior, for instance by regularly updating their visual “vocabu-
lary” along with associated meanings. Yet another effect can also be anticipated. The
increased presence in road trafﬁc of autonomous vehicles practicing a distinct, particularly
rule-based set of behavior could also encourage other road users to adopt such behavior.
This would make trafﬁc more standardized, but not necessarily more efﬁcient. Flexible
cooperation between road users becomes more important when the trafﬁc is busier. The
distances narrow between vehicles, the complexity increases, and more informal signals
are exchanged.

Communication and Communication Problems …
141
Car-to-car communication could provide another technological solution. This would
require all road users—not only autonomous vehicles—to be ﬁtted with the corresponding
technology. Car-to-car communication has undergone years of research and there have
already been a number of demonstrations, some of them on large test sites such as simTD
[20]. The proliferation of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-x (V2X, vehicle to
infrastructure) technology could signiﬁcantly facilitate solving the communication issues
between autonomous vehicles and human drivers.
Frost & Sullivan [21] project that by the year 2030, 40 % of vehicles will be equipped
with V2V or V2X technology due to the major advantages these technologies offer users,
including reducing trafﬁc jams and enhancing safety. The rapid spread of this technology,
initially with a different focus in mind, could thus mitigate communication problems
between autonomous vehicles and those driven by humans.
Yet even then there will still be some situations that autonomous vehicles cannot solve,
either because the other road users do not have the necessary communication devices or
because the situation cannot be resolved through communication alone. If the autonomous
vehicle operates without a driver to take over driving on short notice (although not
immediately), a remote driver or guidance system would have to step in.
7.10
Conclusions
Because vehicle-to-vehicle communication options are currently very limited and unre-
liable, a wide variety of glances, actions, and action sequences are used to communicate
with unprotected road users. Depending on the circumstances and the state of mind of the
people involved, interpersonal negotiations can have varying levels of intensity. The rules
applied in these cases are highly culturally speciﬁc. In particular, the expectations placed
on the other person vary widely from culture to culture, so it would not be possible to
compile universal rules for robotic vehicles. Another problem arises merely due to the fact
that the vehicle’s driver, the robot, is unrecognizable. This is evident for driverless cars, at
any rate. If a person is sitting in the driver’s seat of the autonomous vehicle, any com-
munication would likely be misdirected at the presumed human driver. Mixed trafﬁc
including cyclists and other vehicle types would be difﬁcult to implement without the
ability to recognize other road users’ glances and gestures. This is especially true in
low-speed settings. As the speed increases, this form of communication plays a less
signiﬁcant role for a variety of reasons:
• It is not 100 % explicit.
• It requires feedback from the other person, which would take too long.
• At high speed there is a limited ability to assess the other road user’s reaction. There is
not enough time to evaluate another driver’s gaze, for instance.
What requirements does this create for ensuring functionality based on communication
with other road users?
142
B. Färber
As such, autonomous vehicles must initially behave as if there were no informal
communication, in other words, abiding completely by the rules. In the event of an
unresolvable situation, either a human driver must take over, or in the absence of one, a
centralized authority would need to intervene. Trafﬁc management would be organized
similarly to air trafﬁc, in which air trafﬁc control coordinates all aircrafts’ movements both
in the sky and on the tarmac. Instead of a pilot executing air trafﬁc control’s instructions,
the robotic vehicle would receive instructions about how to maneuver and independently
ensure the vehicle’s stability as it carried them out. It remains unclear how an autonomous
vehicle would recognize that the situation cannot be resolved or how the trafﬁc control
authority would be informed of the relevant details.

Mobility
Foreword
Will autonomous driving alter people’s mobility? Will we be mobile in different ways in
future? Quite simply, what will be the pathway to future mobility? And what do transport
and urban planners need to think about when planning tomorrow’s mobility, with its
autonomous vehicles? These types of questions from the “Mobility” section are aimed at
discussing initial informed reﬂections on an everyday world where autonomous driving is
an integral part of the transport system. The authors of the seven subsequent chapters
examine the issues posing particular challenges in realizing “autonomous mobility.”
Establishing a framework for such (mobility) trends is a task that politicians are only
gradually beginning to turn towards. In their chapter Autonomous Driving—Political,
Legal, Social, and Sustainability Dimensions, Miranda Schreurs and Sibyl Steuwer show
which initiatives have been encouraged on the part of policymakers not only in Germany,
but also in the EU and USA. They make clear how objectives and interests at both
industrial and policy level guide the approach of political bodies, and how these are
primarily aimed at pursuing long-term objectives. The authors also advocate providing the
debate on autonomous driving with a broad setting, allowing for the technology’s social
relevance to be addressed alongside technical and legal issues.
In their article New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous Driving: The Potential for
Change, Barbara Lenz and Eva Fraedrich look at the question of how new mobility
concepts such as carsharing, and also old ones like public transport, could change by
integrating autonomous vehicles into them. They identify how these systems may be made
more ﬂexible in potentially very far-reaching ways, and they also pick out starting points
for individualizing public transportation. They conclude that autonomous vehicles offer
considerable potential, initially only gradually becoming visible, for transforming the
transport system and increasing the public system’s attractiveness. At the same time,
however, they point out that trends in the new systems’ costs and proﬁtability will require
measuring.
Barbara Lenz and Eva Fraedrich
The article Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation by Sven
Beiker examines potential paths to the practical introduction of autonomous vehicles. The
author distinguishes between three scenarios on the path to autonomous vehicles: (1) an
evolutionary scenario, (2) a revolutionary scenario, and (3) a transformative scenario, and
then looks at their impact on the transport system, their demands in terms of technical
developments, their regulatory requirements, and their signiﬁcance for corporate strate-
gies. He concludes that the scenarios named are currently still completely independent of
one another, and it is possible that the path to autonomous driving will initially proceed in
different usage areas that will only “merge” step-by-step.
What will it actually mean for our cities to have autonomous vehicles on their roads? In
his paper Autonomous Driving and Urban Structure, Dirk Heinrichs takes a look at what
impact automated road trafﬁc could have on cities and urban structure. He also examines
current scenarios for cities of the future with regard to ideas developed for transport,
particularly those assuming fully automated road trafﬁc. He lays out the essential positive
effects as well as the negative ones. In each case, argues Heinrichs, it is the task of
integrated urban and transport planning to confront in good time the challenges of
autonomous driving, and above all to consider the interplay between long-term and daily
mobility decisions.
In order to be able to evaluate mobility and transport trends in terms of their impact,
and of how controllable they are, transport and urban planners require quantitative
models. One important element in this ﬁeld is so-called demand modeling. This is able to
map, for example, how changes in car usage—in this case, to be driven instead of to drive
oneself—affect people’s mobility. At present, however, it is still difﬁcult to develop such
models, as empirical values on people’s transport behavior in the face of automated
driving are not yet available. In her paper Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving
from a Demand-Modeling Perspective, Rita Cyganski discusses how autonomous driving
may be integrated into demand models. Based on a survey, she further shows that simply
assuming the advantages of being driven is, for the moment at least, not realistic, and
therefore also not an appropriate starting point for demand modeling.
One essential inﬂuence on transport demand stems not least from the vehicles with
which demand is served. In their chapter on the Effects of Autonomous Driving on the
Vehicle Concept, Hermann Winner and Walther Wachenfeld describe what opportunities
there are for changes to the vehicle concept in the areas of bodywork, drive system,
chassis, interior, and the human-machine interface. The authors then outline how the
vehicle itself and its usability could change as a result of all this, and they suspect that
automation will not be a driver of revolution in the vehicle concept. They do, however, see
considerable scope for vehicles to further diversify in purpose speciﬁc ways. Not least,
this may lead to them being used in new ways—perhaps even as rolling living rooms,
workspaces or bedrooms.
It is possible that autonomous vehicles will not only be used privately, but also as part
of passenger transport systems. These systems might not only operate on the roads

autonomously, but also provide automated services. With his chapter Implementation of
an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System, Sven Beiker ﬁrstly lays out the basic research
questions that need answering here, and then introduces the current implementation of
such a system on the campus of Stanford University in California. The chapter thus
provides a vivid example of an actual deployment of a road vehicle in a public space,
albeit a controlled one.

Introduction
Autonomous driving (self-driving) vehicles, once just a science ﬁction dream, are a
growing reality. Although not commercially available, rapid advancements in technology
are creating a situation where technological development needs are moving beyond the
regulatory environment. Technological developments have put pressure on governments
to make regulatory changes permitting on-road testing of autonomous vehicles. Nevada
became the ﬁrst government worldwide to provide licenses for the testing and operation of
autonomous vehicles in the state albeit under strict conditions. The Nevada Department of
Motor Vehicles notes that “when autonomous vehicles are eventually made available for
public use, motorists will be required to obtain a special driver license endorsement…”
[8]. Other states have followed Nevada’s lead. New regulations in the United States have
provoked the question of whether regulatory changes are necessary in Europe as well.
This chapter examines the emerging competition among automobile manufacturers related
to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles and their political and reg-
ulatory implications. Special attention is paid to the role of industrial stakeholders and
political actors in relation to the development, uptake, and regulation of autonomous
vehicle technologies. This is done from a comparative perspective considering develop-
ments in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden,
and Japan. The different framings of autonomous vehicle technologies and their potential
contributions are also considered.

8.2
Autonomous Driving from an Innovation Policy Perspective
Increasing vehicle automation can be understood as an innovation process that may
eventually lead to autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. Innovations can be classiﬁed
according to the kind of innovation (e.g. product, process, organizational), the phases of
innovation (invention, innovation, diffusion) or the magnitude of innovation (ranging
from incremental to radical). A variety of inﬂuencing factors shape innovation processes.
These include actors and actor networks, institutional frameworks, and technological
developments both inside the innovation system and external to it. There may be
co-evolutionary development of (technological) innovations and inﬂuencing factors [35].
Political intervention is one factor that can inﬂuence innovation processes and is our focus
below.
Automated technologies have been incorporated into cars for decades, including
anti-lock brakes, rear view alarm systems, lane departure warning systems, and adaptive
cruise control. Information and communication technologies are likely to make possible
the rapid deployment of some automated technologies (as is already the case with auto-
mated braking systems). Automated driving technologies could improve emergency
response, enhance public transport systems, and optimize intermodal passenger transport.
Autonomous vehicle technology is now rapidly developing as autonomous driving
vehicles are tested on the road. Various future development paths are possible as indicated
by the use cases described in the chapters by Wachenfeld et al. (Chap. 2) (see also Beiker
in this book Chap. 14). Autonomous vehicle technology development paths range from
incremental (e.g. automatic braking systems and transmission systems) to larger (auto-
mated crash avoidance safety systems and autonomous valet parking) to revolutionary
changes to existing systems (fully autonomous vehicles in regular trafﬁc) (for a deﬁnition
and nomenclature see e.g. [25, 44]). Depending on the state of a technology and the
degree to which it has been implemented, there are different policy implications and
regulatory intervention needs.
Different technological and use paths place different demands on the policy system.
Incremental technological changes can usually be addressed with relatively minor changes
to existing regulatory frameworks. More radical technological changes, such as the fully
autonomous vehicle, will require deeper regulatory interventions as well as societal
awareness raising and acceptance. The information and communication technologies
(ICT) used in autonomous vehicles could also raise various questions related to data
protection and storage although this will depend very much on the kind of technologies
employed (Chap. 24).
Certainly one of the changes visible in relation to the emergence of autonomous
vehicle technology is the emergence of new stakeholders. The technologies involved have
widened the ﬁeld of actors engaged in transport policies and led to the formation of new
political coalitions. The ICT industries are important stakeholders in autonomous vehicle
technologies and policies. Auto manufacturers and other players (like Google) are both in
150
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
competition in the development of prototypes and in cooperation with each other in an
effort to achieve a more favorable regulatory environment for the testing of autonomous
vehicle technology.
The commercialization of autonomous vehicles is envisioned in the coming years by
some manufacturers although there is considerable uncertainty as to when and if the
technology will be made commercially available any time soon. Conditions for com-
mercialization may also vary signiﬁcantly country to country depending on road trafﬁc
conditions. While there are many questions as to whether commercialization is realistic in
the near future, expert communities are urging regulators to prepare. In some jurisdictions
(especially in the United States) early preparatory steps for potential deeper regulatory
changes are being taken.
The speed and quality of advancements in autonomous driving technologies will
impact demands for political intervention and steering. Many political interventions are
driven by technological advancements. In the case of incremental technology develop-
ment, there may be a parallel process of incremental regulatory changes, licensing deci-
sions, or increase or decrease in ﬁnancial or other political support schemes.
Incremental technological changes can be researched from the perspective of systems
innovation theory, where innovations are understood as a result of multilateral interaction
processes among ﬁrms, industries, organizations, and institutional frameworks [13–15]. In
the case of more revolutionary technological developments which result in more dis-
ruptive changes to the status quo, politicians may be forced to make rapid and major
regulatory decisions with little preparatory or learning time and with few existing expe-
riences to draw upon.
In some cases, political actors may decide to try to accelerate the development of
certain technologies and their large scale application. We have seen examples of
policy-driven development with, for example, nuclear and renewable energies. In these
cases, governments set incentives to support the development of these technologies, e.g.
with research and development funding, support schemes, loans, the provision of
infrastructure, and the taking over of liability risks and in the case of some countries, later
made decisions to phase-out the use of a particular technology. There are also various
examples in the transport sector, where state actors aimed at paving the way for certain
technological choices. Apart from providing road infrastructure and thereby supporting
individual automotive transport systems, e-mobility is a recent example of an attempt by
policy-makers to help boost the implementation of a particular technology on a larger
scale [7].
Policy makers do not typically like to intervene in the workings of market economies
but at times may feel pressured to do so. As Edquist formulates it “[t]here must be a
‘problem’—which is not automatically solved by market forces and capitalist actors—for
public intervention to be considered” [14].
Different factors may be behind a decision to support new technologies or techno-
logical applications. Policy makers may choose to promote a technology’s development in

problem-pressures (e.g. safety or environmental factors), to experiment with new tech-
nological possibilities, or in reaction to international developments. As Edler and his
colleagues put it: “Public innovation policy aims to strengthen the competitiveness of the
economy or of selected sectors, in order to increase social welfare through knowledge
creation and economic success” [12]. Numerous studies illustrate the importance of
political intervention especially in the ﬁeld of environmental policy innovation (see e.g.
[30–32]).
There are several ways political actors can support the development and diffusion of
new technologies. They may encourage and support the development of expert networks,
ﬁnance research and development, create demand for a certain technology (e.g. by setting
up support schemes or mandating government purchasing of a technology), and, by
providing basic infrastructure (for a summary of approaches see [35]). Research support
has been relevant in the development of autonomous vehicle technologies as well. States
that are lagging behind in the technology are now scrambling to catch up. Since inno-
vations go through various phases (see e.g. [26, 36]), governmental interventions may also
be limited to particular innovation stages of a technology.
8.3
Visions of Autonomous Driving in Europe
Visions of the future can both inﬂuence and reﬂect regulatory debates and their public
perception. Visions for autonomous driving are being shaped by various stakeholders who
have their own interests in advancing particular framings. When particular framings of a
technology take hold, they have the potential to direct future R&D trajectories and other
societal and political actions. As we will see below, autonomous vehicle technologies are
increasingly being viewed as an important component of future transport systems. Their
development is being linked to concerns about industrial competitiveness, sustainable
development, resource efﬁciency, safety, and assistance for the elderly and others who
might otherwise not be able to drive a car. At the same time, there are some voices of
concern that there could be a loss of control through robotization of automobiles. Here we
consider how autonomous driving is discussed at the European level before turning further
below to discussions in other economies.
To understand how autonomous driving vehicles are being discussed at the European
level, we looked at strategy documents, European-funded research projects, and important
networks related to autonomous driving. The analysis shows something of a mismatch
between the interests of speciﬁc industrial actors in a rapid commercialization of auton-
omous driving technologies with broader European visions and objectives in the transport
area in which autonomous driving technologies play some role, but little attention is given
to autonomous vehicle technologies. Autonomous driving technologies are not widely
discussed in European strategic documents although some research projects are being
funded. This could be important since the extent of attention given to a subject and the
visions associated with it may determine whether or not political support is lent to a
152
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
technology’s development. With little explicit attention given to autonomous driving
vehicles at the European level, little political action can be expected unless there are either
sudden technological innovation shocks or stronger political lobbying by stakeholders.
8.3.1
European Strategy Documents
Autonomous driving technologies have received little attention to date in European
Commission strategic documents, including roadmaps, green papers, and white papers. To
the extent autonomous vehicle technologies are discussed it is often in the context of
broader EU debates on European competitiveness, innovation, climate protection, energy
security, employment, and education (the EU 2020 strategy) [17].
Guided by the general framework objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, the following
documents were analyzed: “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area - Towards a
competitive and resource efﬁcient transport system” [18], “Research and innovation for
Europe’s future mobility. Developing a European transport-technology strategy” [19], the
“CARS 2020: Action Plan for a competitive and sustainable automotive industry in
Europe” [20], and the “Directive on Intelligent Transport Systems” [24]. These strategic
documents cover issues linked to autonomous driving: mobility, infrastructure, digital-
ization, and general European discourses related to innovation and climate protection. The
documents differ in their degree of speciﬁcity.
These documents shed light on which actors are taking up autonomous vehicle
developments and give an impression of how far reaching the debate on autonomous
driving currently is in Europe. They also give a picture of how autonomous driving
technology is being framed and which other societal, technological, and political issues it
is being linked to. Finally—and maybe most importantly—these documents hint at the
opportunities for and obstacles to the wider implementation of autonomous vehicle
technologies at the European level.
8.3.1.1 Competitiveness and Innovation
The European Union has as one of its goals strengthening the competitiveness of Euro-
pean industry and technological leadership including in important sectors like transport.
The European Union’s transport roadmap stresses that “innovation is essential” to
maintaining European competitiveness. Three areas of innovation that are stressed are:
“efﬁciency through new engines, material, and design”, “cleaner energy use”, and “safer
and more secure operations through information and communication systems” [18].
The communication document from the European Commission to the Parliament and
the Council with the title “Research and innovation for Europe’s future mobility.
Developing a European transport-technology strategy” [19] can be seen as the starting
point for the development of a strategic transport-technology plan. At its visionary core is
the expected change towards high value-added, innovative transport technologies. The
transport industry of the future is expected to have to deal with highly complex mobility
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
153
systems and to achieve this with a much lower carbon content. New materials, new
production processes and new technology partners as well as “a stronger cross-fertilisation
between the transport modes” are seen as crucial elements of this industry transition. The
communication further stresses the expectation that the transport sector, the energy sector
and information and communication technologies will be increasingly intertwined.
With regard to the automotive industry, strengthening competitiveness is central to
European policy-makers. This is reﬂected by the CARS 2020 Action Plan, which was
developed by DG ENTR (Directorate-general for Enterprise and Industry). The Com-
petitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st century (CARS 21), the antecessor to
CARS 2020, is concerned with overcoming the economic crisis in general and the crisis of
the European automotive industry in particular. It sets a vision of: “An automotive
industry that is leading in technology, in coordinated action with the fuel supplier
industry, producing vehicles which are attractive to EU consumers, clean in terms of
regulated pollutants, more fuel-efﬁcient, safe, quiet and connected” [20].
8.3.1.2 Efficiency and Sustainability
At the European level, innovation is often linked to the development of an energy and
resource-efﬁcient and sustainable transport system. The transport roadmap spells out “A
vision for a competitive and sustainable transport system”. The document highlights the
dual goal of increasing transport and mobility within the Union while reducing green-
house gas emissions by 60 % until 2050. It further links EU 2020 and its ﬂagship
initiative on resource efﬁciency to transport policy. This translates into a transport system
that “uses less and cleaner energy, better exploit a modern infrastructure and reduce its
negative impact on the environment and key natural assets like water, land and ecosys-
tems” [18]. The document preparing the transport-technology strategy repeatedly stresses
the EU’s vision to strengthen competitiveness by decarbonizing the transport system and
accordingly calls for research in green technologies, material substitutions, and ICT in
order to optimize intermodal and public transport and thereby enhance efﬁciency [19].
And also the CARS 2020 action plan establishes a strong link between competitiveness
and clean and green vehicles [20].
8.3.1.3 Harmonization and Coordination
Realizing a single European market is at the heart of all European strategic documents
related to transportation. This is a factor in the strong push for greater harmonization and
coordination of national policies. The transport roadmap highlights the importance the EU
Commission attaches to harmonization; here it is argued that “a situation where (for
example) one Member State opted exclusively for electric cars and another only for
biofuels would destroy the concept of free travel across Europe.” It also illustrates that the
EU Commission aims at inﬂuencing technology development.
Also in the CARS 2020 action plan the fragmentation of vehicle regulation among EU
Member States is considered problematic. The European Commission has called for more
coordination and standardization [20]. In the CARS 21 process, Europe’s role in
154
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
standardization has been highlighted. European Commission Vice-President Neelie Kroes
“underlined the business opportunities created by making vehicles digital and connected,
which requires public support for funding and standardisation” [4]. CARS 2020 mentions
the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with reference to the automatic
emergency call system, eCall as a particular organizational challenge which demands
strong coordination [20].
8.3.1.4 Safety
The “vision zero” which refers to the goal of eliminating trafﬁc fatalities and injuries by
2050 is a key selling point for the industry. Safety is also addressed in the transport
roadmap, although it receives considerably less attention compared to other issues, such as
competitiveness, sustainability, resource-efﬁciency, or, innovation.
The “vision zero” is mentioned as the ninth of ten goals of the transport roadmap. In
line with this goal, the EU aims at halving road casualties by 2020. The EU is to be a
world leader in safety and security of transport in all modes of transport [18]. Annex I
spells out how to approach that goal and mentions—besides training and education—
technological solutions such as “driver assistance systems, (smart) speed limiters, seat-belt
reminders, eCall, cooperative systems and vehicle-infrastructure interfaces.” These can be
seen as steps towards a general increase in automation and employment of information
and communication technologies.
While the Directive on Intelligent Transport Systems puts comparatively high priority
on an increase in safety through the application of information and communication
technology, it does not explicitly speak of autonomous driving [24].
8.3.1.5 Summary
The document, “Research and innovation for Europe’s future mobility. Developing a
European transport-technology strategy” [19] is where one might expect autonomous
driving to be discussed as the communication addresses research, innovation, and mobility
issues. Yet, while the term ‘smart’ occurs repeatedly in the text, neither ‘autonomous’ or
‘driverless vehicles’ are mentioned. ‘Intelligent’ and ‘automated’ are mentioned only once
in the context of transport infrastructure: “Modern infrastructure will increasingly incor-
porate new components which make it smart (intelligent, ICT-enabled and automated),
green (new light and recyclable materials) and intermodal (automated terminals, hubs, and
equipment). It will integrate the provision of alternative, low carbon fuels and innovative
management and operation systems” [19].
Also with regard to research and innovation, autonomous driving is not discussed in
the transport-technology strategy document although it could be argued that smart
mobility is related to autonomous driving. Many of the visions described in the strategic
document can be seen as being linked to autonomous vehicles, such as the interdepen-
dence between information and communication technologies and the transport system.
Yet the main focus is on green technologies, material substitution and ICT and the
optimization of intermodal transport.

Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
155
Similarly,
autonomous
driving
is
not
explicitly
mentioned
in
the
transport
roadmap. Rather, intelligent transport systems, new communication services, and
improved trafﬁc management and information systems are seen as future opportunities to
optimize trafﬁc ﬂow and reduce congestion and it is in this context that there are calls for
further research and innovation. Links are made to multimodality and optimization of the
use of infrastructure. Increased automation is not discussed centrally in relation to the
modernization of the automotive industry in Europe. It is not even mentioned as an
explicit topic in the CARS 2020 action plan.
The Directive on Intelligent Transport Systems, supported by DG Transport, targets steps
to be taken towards the application of ITS and thus could be argued to touch upon aspects of
autonomous driving, but does not explicitly mention the term or similar terms [24].
In summary, it can be said that while developments related to autonomous driving are
mentioned in major strategic and vision documents, autonomous vehicles or autonomous
driving are as such not ﬁrmly embraced by European bureaucrats or politicians.
8.3.2
Research Related to Autonomous Driving (EU)
Somewhat more attention to autonomous vehicle technologies is being paid in
European-funded research projects. There are various research projects funded by EU
institutions that could impact autonomous driving. eCall is an initiative to bring rapid
assistance to motorists involved in accidents. The Galileo project is a civilian global
satellite-based navigation system. TAXISAT, is a related global navigation satellite sys-
tem being developed for taxis. The SARTRE project, which is funded under the European
Union’s Framework 7 program, aims at advancing platooning (convoying to make more
efﬁcient use of road space). The project HAVE-it follows a long-term vision of autono-
mous driving and aims at high levels of automation. The purpose of the project is to
“develop, validate and demonstrate important intermediate steps towards highly auto-
mated driving” such as advanced driver assistance systems. The research project,
“SMART- New services enabled by the connected car”, focused on the implication,
beneﬁts, and services of connected cars. The project’s ﬁnal report concluded that the
connected car may make better use of infrastructure and will increase safety as well as fuel
efﬁciency. The EU project “Citymobil—Advanced Transport for the Urban Environment”
looked at automated public transport systems and some showcases (e.g. La Rochelle,
Heathrow) with the aim of bringing the implementation of these public transport systems
in cities one step further. An example of a joint public-private R&D initiative supported
by various directorates-general (RTD—Research and Innovation, CNECT—Communi-
cations Networks, Content and Technology, ENER—Energy, ENV—Environment,
ENTR—Enterprise and Industry) in the vehicle area is the European Green Cars Initiative
launched in 2009 and with a priority on the development of efﬁcient, safe, and envi-
ronmentally friendly mobility, especially electro-mobility. Another important project is
AdaptIVe, a successor to InteractIVe. Started in January 2014 and funded by the European
156
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
Union’s Framework 7 Program, this consortium of 29 partners aims to demonstrate the
potentials for automated driving in complex trafﬁc environments while addressing some
legal issues related to levels 1 to 4 of the SAE classiﬁcation system.
Currently, the European Union is supporting research on autonomous driving within its
framework research support scheme, “Horizon 2020”. There are several entry points for
research on autonomous vehicles under the Horizon 2020 work program on leadership in
enabling and industrial technologies in the section on Information and Communication
Technologies [22]. Research for the transport sector is funded via the work program’s
Chap. 11 on smart, green and integrated transport. Here, autonomous driving is explicitly
mentioned: “Automated and progressively autonomous driving applications in road
transport, actively interacting with their intelligent environment could provide an answer
to the EU objective of reconciling growing mobility needs with more efﬁcient transport
operations, lower environmental impacts and increased road safety” [21]. Apart from
technical aspects including research on Advanced Driver Assistance Services, other
aspects are supported such as behavioral aspects of driving (users’ responses to tech-
nology and on-board infrastructure, conditions of attention/loss of attention, etc.), ethical
and gender issues as well as liability and standardization questions. The aim is to enhance
the technology’s robustness and effectiveness in real-life situations.
In sum, research funded by the EU addresses various aspects of vehicle automation, the
linking of information and communication systems to enhance efﬁciency, and research
into autonomous vehicle technologies. There are growing signs of interest in the legal and
societal implications of various automation levels and efforts to develop common deﬁ-
nitions of vehicle automation levels. In the future, there will be need for more research on
legal and societal questions tied to the greater use of automation in the transport sector.
8.3.3
Actors and Arenas for Autonomous Driving in the EU
At the European level, different Directorates General (DG) are involved with questions
addressing autonomous driving, with DG Connect being somewhat more engaged than for
example, DG Mobility and Transport (MOVE) or DG Enterprise and Industry (ENTR). In
general, the EU Commission’s interests in the transport area are more related to
strengthening competitiveness throughout the whole Union including in remote areas (by
e.g. supporting basic infrastructure development) and combating climate change (i.e.
e-mobility, urban development that supports public transport, bicycles, etc.) and not so
much on implementing a vision of wide-spread use of autonomous driving vehicles.
DG Connect supports research in the ﬁeld of automated mobility. It mainly addresses
the research on intelligent transport systems (ITS) and highlights the role of ICT for ITS
and mobility for it helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increases energy efﬁciency
in the transport sector, and enhances safety and mobility for people and goods in general.
ICT is, however, mostly connected to the provision of real time trafﬁc information and not
explicitly to autonomous road vehicles.
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
157
Information on autonomous driving is generally best assessed from DG Connect.
While various aspects and projects are listed on their website, DG Connect forwards the
reader to the iMobility Forum when looking for ‘Automated Driving’. iMobility is one of
the two main platforms on the European level that addresses vehicle automation. Via the
iMobility Forum, the Commission is in contact with stakeholders. The platform is chaired
by DG Connect and co-chaired by ERTICO-ITS Europe as well as the European Auto-
mobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and the European Association with tolled
motorways, bridges and tunnels (ASECAP). Within iMobility, there is a working group
on vehicle road automation. DG Connect partly ﬁnances this network. The iMobility
Forum is linked to the ERTICO platform on intelligent transport systems in Europe. It was
founded as a joint initiative by the European Commission, national transport ministries as
well as industry representatives and aims to be a networking platform to spur exchange
between actors and stakeholders related to all kinds of aspects of intelligent transport
systems. It gives an overview about various research projects and activities in European
Member States on ITS—and accordingly, automated vehicles [16].
In addition, the European Union provides a platform for debating visions of the future:
FUTURIUM, part of the Digital Agenda of Europe. Here several articles about autono-
mous driving can be found.
To summarize, autonomous driving is not strategically anchored in European
policy-making. The overarching discourses and objectives in the European transport
sector can be subsumed under the headlines “competitiveness”, “sustainability”, “efﬁ-
ciency”, “low-carbon” and, to a lesser degree, “safety”. While autonomous driving can
arguably contribute to any of these overarching objectives, stakeholders have not yet made
much effort to make these links. The actors most actively addressing autonomous driving
at the EU level deal with communication technologies, smart mobility, and intelligent
transport systems (DG Connect including links to the EU’s vision for the Digital Europe).
The automotive industry is mainly represented by its association. Individual companies do
not appear very active on this issue at the EU-level. Autonomous driving is still in the
realm of research rather than implementation and there exists no delineable vision for a
future where autonomous vehicles play a major role. The use cases addressed in this book
do not play a role at the European level. In addition, there is a lack of integration of the
topic into existing visions on transport and mobility. The needs for regulation and further
research and development are being discussed in working groups both at the European
and the German national levels, although autonomous driving is not high on the political
agenda in either case. While the European Commission’s administration is (co-) funding
some of these initiatives, it has not taken a lead on the regulatory front; rather it is mostly
active in supporting research and development. This is similar to the case in Germany.
The issue of autonomous driving is on the radar screen of the German transport ministry
and major associations but is only now slowly beginning to gain somewhat more atten-
tion. As is discussed further below, one relatively important new development is the
reform of the United Nations Convention on Trafﬁc Safety of 1968 that has been pushed
by European automakers concerned about losing ground to international competitors.
158
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
Next on their agenda is likely to be enabling legislation at the national level for testing
purposes.
8.4
National and International Legislative and Political
Developments
There are some differences in national discourses and support strategies for autonomous
vehicles in major automobile producing markets and in the European Union. Below we
consider developments in the United States, Japan, the European Union, the United
Kingdom, Sweden and Germany. A common characteristic of these countries and the EU
is that they lack national regulations for autonomous vehicles. It has been with state-level
regulations in the United States and special permits in the case of European countries that
test driving of self-driving cars has begun on public roads [33].
8.4.1
Regulatory Changes to the United Nations Convention
on Road Traffic (Vienna Convention)
Reacting to developments in the United States, at the European level debates about the
need for modifying the United Nations Convention on Road Trafﬁc (the Vienna Con-
vention) which had been on-going for about a decade, intensiﬁed. Article 8, paragraph 5,
of the 1968 convention states: “Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle
or to guide his animals” [5]. Before Google pushed the debate forward, there was con-
siderable disagreement among experts as to how much of an obstacle the Vienna Con-
vention was. Google’s release of its Self-Driving Car tipped the scale in the direction of
regulatory change. As reported by Euractiv in the summer of 2013: “The EU is currently
slightly lagging behind the U.S. Autonomous driving is forging ahead in the US where
steps are currently being taken to advance the technology by states adopting laws allowing
for public road testing. However, Europe continues to lag behind the US with restrictive
legislation that could, for the foreseeable future, effectively prevent the introduction of
more advanced autonomous driving systems”. The report notes that “while the technology
is ready, appropriate infrastructures and legal framework are still missing” [34]. In May
2014, the governments of Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and Austria jointly proposed
an amendment that was agreed to by the U.N. Working Party on Road Trafﬁc Safety. The
amendment would allow self-driving technologies as long as the system “can be over-
ridden or switched off by the driver” [40]. If agreed upon by the parties to the convention,
this could ease conditions for research and development of autonomous vehicles in many
countries. For a more critical discussion see also Sect. 8.4.6.
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
159
8.4.2
USA
The United States is the most advanced nation in terms of introducing autonomous driving
vehicles into its transport system. Legislation on autonomous driving has been passed in
California, Michigan, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. In another six states
—Arizona, Colorado, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas—the legislative
attempts failed or are pending. There are another dozen of states with ongoing regulatory
initiatives. Some common features of their regulation regard the deﬁnitions of autono-
mous driving and autonomous vehicles employed and the conditions for obtaining
operation and testing permission. Liability issues are also beginning to gain attention.
California has set a 2015 deadline for the establishment of liability rules [48]. The leg-
islation enacted in the United States is in many ways with an eye towards the testing of
autonomous driving vehicles as it is currently very restrictive regarding their use. At this
stage neither the U.S. government nor the automotive industries want to take large risks in
relation to a technology that is still in an early development stage and that must still prove
its reliability and safety. The same could be said for the other countries looked at here.
Regulatory initiatives in the United States were a direct response to Google’s push for
legal clariﬁcation regarding the status of autonomous vehicles. Google, an active devel-
oper of self-driving soft-ware and technology, has lobbied state by state for the legislation
enabling the operation of self-driving vehicles.
Various U.S. politicians have strongly spoken up for the technology. Governors and
other state politicians have on various occasions praised autonomous vehicles in public
and claimed their leadership relative to other states by being frontrunners in passing
supportive legislation.
Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval in early summer 2011 upon the passage of his state’s
ﬁrst law on autonomous driving vehicles stated: “Nevada is the ﬁrst state in the country
that is going to be (adopting) regulations for this vehicle (…) I think it is important for
Nevada to be ﬁrst on this. This is going to be part of the future and Nevada has always
been a very progressive state” [49]. In the Florida Senate, Republican Jeff Brandes
sponsored an autonomous driving bill stating, “this legislation is about vision and lead-
ership for the 21st Century world and forges a path for future innovative economic
opportunities for Floridians” [42]. In September, when signing autonomous driving into
law, Californian Governor Jerry Brown pointed out that he sees autonomous vehicles as
“another example of how California’s technological leadership is turning today’s science
ﬁction into tomorrow’s reality. (…) This law will allow California’s pioneering engineers
to safely test and implement this amazing new technology” [2]. Noting that the state was
slipping behind competitors, Michigan’s Governor Rick Snyder urged action. In his state
of the state speech in January 2013 the governor lamented: “They [California, Nevada and
Florida] are ahead of us, and aren’t we the automotive capital of the world?” [6]. These
examples give a clear impression of how politicians are starting to see autonomous vehicle
technology and why they are promoting autonomous driving. For the leaders of these
pioneering states, autonomous driving is seen as a sign of being on the technological
160
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
cutting edge. The technology’s developers stress the safety beneﬁts expected to come with
the implementation of the technology, the increased comfort it will provide for elderly
people, and the reduction in trafﬁc congestion it should bring about.
Google has been an important entrepreneur that has stimulated both technological and
regulatory developments. Google is a new and non-traditional player in transport, a sector
which until now has been dominated by the automotive industry. With its retroﬁtting of
automobiles with robotic software, the IT-company has challenged the automotive
industry to innovate in new directions (Chap. 10). As noted above it has also put regu-
lators under pressure to take action. Indeed, regulations have had to catch up with the
technological innovations. Google’s actions have also pushed self-driving technologies
onto the international agenda. It has opened up new research agendas and challenged
policy makers and legal experts to consider the technological and social meanings of this
rapidly developing new technology. In the European Union as well as internationally, it is
also leading to discussions about the need for early harmonization of standards so as to
prevent the institutionalization of incompatible standards in different world regions, e.g.
via United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regulations and vehicle
type approvals that make sure that a vehicle design is conform to technical requirements.
Beyond these issues, the role of ICT in the automotive industry of the future and very
importantly, data protection concerns, will need societal debates and decisions.
In May 2013, the National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) estab-
lished an ofﬁcial classiﬁcation scheme for vehicles which range from level 0 where the
driver is in complete control of the vehicle at all times to level 4 where the vehicle
performs all safety-critical functions and monitors roadway conditions for the entire trip
and could include unoccupied cars. The intermediary levels make increasing use of
autonomous vehicle technologies. The NHTSA also issued recommendations to aid states
as they make regulatory decisions regarding vehicles with new technological capacities
[1]. There are other classiﬁcation schemes that have developed as well. In particular the
comprehensive SAE Standard J3016. It distinguishes between six categories with levels 0
(no automation), 1 (driver assistance) and 2 (partial automation) subsumed under the
headline “human driver monitors the driving environment” and 3 (conditional automa-
tion), 4 (high automation) and 5 (full automation) labeled as “automated driving systems”
[44] (see also Sect. 8.4.6 for the BASt classiﬁcation scheme).
8.4.3
Japan
Inﬂuenced by Google’s lobbying at the state level in the United States, Japan has begun to
exhibit more interest in autonomous vehicles. Japan is renowned both for its robotic
technologies and its low-carbon vehicle technologies. In 2013, Nissan received approval
from the Japanese authorities to test its self-driving car, the Nissan Leaf. The Leaf is the
ﬁrst car that combines an electric motor with an advanced driver assistance system [3].
Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa and Nissan Vice Chairman Toshiyuki Shiga tested the
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
161
car on the Sagawa Expressway near Yokohama [38]. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also has
tested several “self-driving cars” produced by Japanese manufacturers Toyota, Honda, and
Nissan and has claimed that he senses “that the Japanese technology is the world’s best”
[39]. “In particular, in tough driving conditions such as tight curves and lane changing
using autonomous driving, I think our Japanese technologies are among the world’s best”
[37]. The competition to be a leader in the ﬁeld is clearly heating up and politicians are
lending their visibility and weight to support this emerging technology.
8.4.4
United Kingdom
The situation of the United Kingdom is emblematic of the situation in many European
states. There is growing concern that national automobile developers are being hampered
by regulatory restrictions and lack of a clear political strategy for autonomous vehicles.
A September 2013 advise of the British Houses of Parliament, Parliamentary Ofﬁce of
Science and Technology notes, “There is no explicit legislation which governs autono-
mous vehicles on UK roads”. The advice further laments: “At present there is no pub-
lished strategy for the adoption of autonomous vehicles in the UK” [29]. As is the case
with several other European member states, steps to improve the possibilities for testing
are being taken. The British Ministry of Science and Universities has designated £6
million for research and technology into autonomous vehicle technologies and the
Department for Transport is permitting trials on public roads.
8.4.5
Sweden
Sweden is an early pioneer of self-driving technology. The Swedish Government signed a
memorandum of understanding with Volvo to allow ordinary people to use self-driving
cars. The project involves the Swedish Transport Administration, Lindholmen Science
Park and the City of Gothenburg. It is the ﬁrst project that aims at testing autonomous
vehicles on a larger scale with regular citizens. The project which started in 2014 aims at
putting 100 autonomous vehicles onto a 50 km long road in Gothenburg by 2017/2018. It
also sets the year 2020 as a timeline for when the ﬁrst autonomous cars will be available
for general usage [28].
The collaboration between the Swedish government and Volvo in this project suggests
that in Sweden there is political recognition of the potential importance of this new
technology. Swedish public ofﬁcials highlight not only the safety dimensions of the new
technology but also other sustainability factors. Ms. Catharina Elmsäter-Svärd, the
infrastructure minister listed the many challenges to be tackled in the years to come that
would be addressed by autonomous vehicles. These included environment, climate
change, space, and trafﬁc safety. In Europe, there appears to be a stronger linking of broad
sustainability themes to driver-less cars than is the case in the United States [47].
162
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
Claes Tingvall from the Swedish Transport Administration explained why cooperation
between the government and Volvo makes sense. Such cooperation can help address
legislative questions regarding the new technology early on. At the same time, the societal
beneﬁts from the new technology can be incorporated into policy more generally: “We
can make trafﬁc as a whole safer, smoother, less polluting, but also try to build infras-
tructure in a quite different way”. Minister Elmsäter-Svärd noted: “This project is very
unique and the expectation from the Swedish government is still to be in the lead when it
comes to road safety. We know that livability, environment issues and also road safety is
so close together in the project.” Noteworthy, is that the inscription on the Volvo
self-driving car states: “Drive Me. Self-driving cars for sustainable mobility” [47].
8.4.6
Germany
In Germany, autonomous driving vehicles are in the testing phase. For public demon-
stration purposes, the former Minister for Research and Development, Annette Schavan
tested the autonomous driving vehicle, “MadeInGermany”, developed at Freie Universität
Berlin. Autonomous—Autonomie- und Fahrerassistenzsysteme für Pkw und Lkw”—was
supported with 2.2 Million Euros by the Research Ministry. In an interview, Minister
Schavan mentioned the necessity for further innovation of the technology as it could
enhance the mobility of elderly and handicapped people [41]. Apart from AutoNOMOS,
various other research projects in Germany helped to advance an increase in automation
towards autonomous driving, including the Technical University of Braunschweig’s
H-Mode and TU Darmstadt’s’ Conduct-by Wire projects.
The research ministry, which is interested in supporting innovative technologies and
advancing technological niches, has set incentives to promote research on autonomous
driving. The ministry’s high-tech mobility strategy stresses links among energy policy,
e-mobility and intelligent logistics. It further stresses the role of ICT applications in the
automotive industry, although it does not focus explicitly on autonomous driving [11].
But not only has the research ministry funded research on autonomous driving. Currently,
there are more projects under way which are funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy, one of which is the project Afas. It is set up to develop a driverless
vehicle to protect construction sites on highways.
The Federal Highway Research Institute has—similarly to the NHTSA—elaborated a
nomenclature to facilitate the legal assessment of different degrees of automation. The
nomenclature distinguishes “driver only” and “assisted” systems from systems with
“partial automation” (the system takes over lateral and longitudinal control in certain sit-
uations), “high automation” (the driver does not need to continuously monitor the system)
and “full automation” (the system fully takes over lateral and longitudinal control) [25].
This categorization is widely accepted by German experts, bureaucrats, and political
stakeholders.
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
163
The German automotive industry has begun pushing for change. Partnering with
Nokia, Mercedes-Benz responded to the Google challenge in August 2013 with the S 500
Intelligent Drive Autonomous Car long-distance test drive. Following the historic path
travelled by Bertha Benz in 1888 in the world’s ﬁrst long-distance road trip, the S 500
Intelligent Drive vehicle successfully drove on its own between Mannheim and Pforzheim
(with a driver behind the wheel as a back-up). Audi, BMW, and auto-suppliers Bosch and
Continental Automotive Systems are working on autonomous and semi-autonomous
vehicle technologies as well [40].
The German government has not, however, responded with new regulatory initiatives
or an explicit strategy to push the implementation of autonomous driving. Rather, gov-
ernmental actors are focused on other technology options that are rather conform to
European discourses of sustainable mobility. These are linked to the broader over-arching
policy towards a low-carbon energy transformation. E-mobility, for example, is not only
backed by a strategic governmental document but also repeatedly afﬁrmed in speeches by
high-level politicians, including the chancellor [9, 10].
The VDA is one of the technology’s strongest proponents lobbying for regulatory
change. It is one of the few actors that has expressed a clear vision for autonomous driving
in its publications. The VDA has organized conferences centered on vehicle automation,
the connected car and autonomous driving The VDA envisions autonomous driving to be
a wide-spread reality in the future. The association has illustrated concrete steps to be
taken on the way towards a self-driving future, such as Lane Changing Support, improved
human-machine-interface, and longitudinal guiding assistance [45]. In addition, supply
companies have an interest in pushing a higher degree of automation in vehicles and,
consequently, autonomous driving [7].
The main national arena addressing autonomous driving is a round table initiated and
run by the Transport Ministry. On the working level, the participants are trying to insti-
tutionalize a stakeholder dialogue as a ﬁrst step in getting the issue more strongly on the
German political agenda. The approximately 45 round table members meet twice a year.
They consist of representatives of the German Association of Automotive Industry
(Verband der Automobilindustrie, VDA), representatives of automotive manufacturers,
the Ministry of Transport, the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt), the Federal
Motor Transport Agency (KBA), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and
Energy, representatives of science and research (e.g. Fraunhofer Institute, German
Aerospace Center (DLR), universities) and associations (such as the Association of
International
Motor
Vehicle
Manufacturers
(Verband
der
internationalen
Kraft-
fahrzeughersteller, VDIK), the German Insurance Association (Gesamtverband der
Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft, GDV), the German Automobile Club (Allgemeiner
Deutscher Automobilclub, ADAC), and the Association of the Technical Control Boards
(Verband der TÜVs). Three working groups have been established and meet four times a
year. The working groups are concerned with legal questions, issues tied to drivers and
vehicles including type approval, and research.
164
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
The focus on type approval—the procedure whereby an EU Member State certiﬁes that
a type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit satisﬁes the relevant
administrative provisions and technical requirements [23]—in the second working group
on driver and vehicle, shows that the round table aims at dealing with many issues at a
technical and rather low regulatory level (compared to more general legal questions that
would require changes in regulatory law or in the road trafﬁc act). Many aspects of
automation do not touch upon regulated aspects and would be generally allowed since
they are not deﬁned under the UNECE system. Higher level legal aspects would be in the
realm of the Ministry of Justice but are currently not dealt with.
The topics discussed at the round table address highly automatized vehicles but tend
not to address fully automated driving technologies.
The round table talks are to some degree strategic in that they aim at putting or keeping
the topic on the political agenda. It is not so much about visions but about attempts to
show progress in practice. However, the whole process is neither very transparent, nor
very visible—meeting discussions are not documented for the general public and societal
stakeholders are not widely included. There is also little exchange with European plat-
forms on autonomous driving.
In relation to the Vienna Convention, different views regarding the importance of its
amendment have been expressed in Germany. The amendment was welcomed by Thomas
Weber, head of group research at Daimler and head of development at Mercedes-Benz
who was quoted as saying: “Today I am only allowed to take my hands off the wheel to a
limited extent. Thankfully the Vienna Convention on Road Trafﬁc has been changed”
[40]. Other German experts did not see the convention as so much of a hindrance in
relation at least in regard to the highly, but not fully-automated vehicles. By deﬁnition, in
highly automated vehicles, a driver would always be expected to be present and able to
take over control and monitor trafﬁc as expected by current legislation. These experts
considered amendments to public regulatory law to be more important and this has yet to
occur [25, 43]. In a personal interview, Dr. Christoph Hecht from the German Automotive
Club, ADAC, representing the consumer perspective explained that a customer has no
incentive to buy a highly automated vehicle unless they are allowed to make use of it.

Analysis
Autonomous driving is only slowly emerging as a concept known to all but a small
community of experts. It is not deeply anchored in European mobility discourses,
strategies, or outlooks. Yet there is some linking of autonomous driving technologies to
other strategic concerns, including competitiveness of the automotive industry, sustainable
mobility, safety, and the elderly. The framing of autonomous driving varies by national
context, reﬂecting the dominant concerns of different regions. In the United States, where
there are over 30,000 trafﬁc deaths each year, safety issues are brought to the fore. In
Japan, which has been faced by a long economic slump, competitiveness is a top priority.
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
165
In Sweden, autonomous driving is of being linked to sustainable mobility. In Germany, it
is high-end automobiles that are being ﬁtted with autonomous driving technology, sug-
gesting the importance being at the technological cutting edge in the luxury automobile
market. As autonomous vehicle technologies advance, debates in Europe and abroad may
shift, but for the timing being it appears that the commercialization and wide-spread use of
fully automated driving vehicles remains a distant vision.
Innovations in autonomous driving technologies are being presented as important for
technological leadership in the automobile sector across all of the jurisdictions examined
here even if autonomous vehicles are not yet seen as commercially viable.
In the United States, regulatory competition is emerging among states eager to be seen
as frontrunners in systems that could make trafﬁc safer and trafﬁc ﬂows smoother.
State-level actors are boasting their regulatory initiatives to show their state’s techno-
logical leadership. Leadership in realizing ‘science ﬁction’ visions may be important for
long-term competitiveness. This could either be seen as a kind of “Delaware effect”, with
states competing to attract industries to their region with the provision of favorable reg-
ulatory environments, or conversely, a “California effect,” where states compete with each
other by establishing the more advanced regulatory standards to promote technological
innovation and competitive advantage within their own states [46].
In Japan, politicians are sending the message to consumers (both domestic and over-
seas) that autonomous driving technologies can be linked to Japanese technological
strengths in robotics, electro-mobility and energy efﬁciency, to produce next generation
automobiles. The Swedish government is among the most ambitious in its aim to com-
mercialize autonomous driving vehicles by 2020 and set “sustainable mobility” into
motion.
The German government has done little to initiate broader discussions about autono-
mous driving. While the Transport Ministry has organized a stakeholder platform at the
national level, it has not tried to stimulate wider public debates at the German national
level or as part of ofﬁcial consultations at the European level. The main push for greater
discussion and strategizing has come from stakeholders. Volvo, for example, has been
quite active at the EU level as has the German automobile association (VDA). Also
component suppliers such as Continental and ICT companies have lobbied for more
support.
Although by no means deﬁnitive, the research conducted here suggests some other
interesting patterns that deserve further attention as well as some soft and preliminary
conclusions.
First, the kind of regulatory competition seen in the United States, may be spreading to
the international level as countries vie with each other for technological leadership in a
newly emerging ﬁeld. Autonomous driving is not only about the automotive industry but
about many other industrial branches that will proﬁt from a higher degree of automation
such as component suppliers. This is why there is a growing interest in promoting
locational advantages and why political commitments are starting to be made in some
countries to support certain development paths.
166
M.A. Schreurs and S.D. Steuwer
Second, smaller automobile companies (e.g. Volvo, Nissan) and non-traditional players
(e.g. Google) moved earlier with autonomous vehicle technologies to gain public and
political attention compared with the bigger, more established automotive manufacturers
(including German manufacturers). One might read into this that given that autonomous
driving technologies are still at early stages of development, larger companies have been
weary about taking reputational risks with still unproven technologies. Smaller companies
may be more willing to take such risks since they are dependent on leadership advantage.
Geels argues that incumbent ﬁrms’ interest in radical and transformative change is gen-
erally not very high since incumbents have typically sunk investments in existing tech-
nologies, skills, and people. He further points to the characteristics of more radical
changes being more risky and leading to changes that may not match existing compe-
tencies [27].
Third, autonomous vehicles are portrayed as highly innovative and demonstrative of a
nation’s technological (and economical) leadership capabilities by stakeholders, yet
political leaders have not played much of a role in trying to promote autonomous vehicle
technology in public. Fully automated vehicle technology is in an early development
stage. How it ﬁts into dominant strategic visions for mobility or how realistic commer-
cialization of the technology is, is still not clear which may explain why only limited
political actions have been taken.
Fourth, the Zero-Accident-Vision has been an important message for developers of
autonomous vehicles and component suppliers. The vision appears to play a larger role in
the United States where there are higher fatality rates than is the case in Europe or Japan
although in all countries considered, greater use of remote sensing and other technologies
is seen as a means of improving trafﬁc safety.
Fifth, links to efﬁciency and environmental protection are found in all countries, but are
especially strong in Japan and Europe. And within Europe, Sweden is pursuing this image
quite aggressively.
Sixth, there are many unsolved questions with regard to accountability, data protection,
the legal framework as well as social and ethical considerations. These issues are only
slowly beginning to be debated. The possible impacts of autonomous driving on mobility
behaviours and human-machine interactions as well as data protection and acceptance
aspects will need to be studied and addressed. Indeed, nowhere has there been much
political attention paid to the societal implications of greater use of autonomous vehicle
technologies even though there are many non-technical aspects that must be considered
(Chap. 29). These include the development of appropriate regulations covering techno-
logical, safety, and liability standards as well as rules of the road for autonomous vehicles.
There remain also many open questions with regard to public regulatory law, licensing
law and liability law in the countries considered (Chap. 25).
Seventh, perhaps reﬂective of the fact that autonomous vehicles are still only in early
pilot testing phases, few efforts have been made to develop future mobility scenarios in
which autonomous driven vehicles play a central role (Chap. 11). In Europe, the
8
Autonomous Driving—Political, Legal, …
167
driverless-car vision has not been embedded in an overall strategy for realizing sustainable
mobility.
Finally, where the most governmental activity can be seen is in providing support for
research and development of autonomous vehicle technologies. States that are lagging
behind technologically are scrambling to catch up by supporting more research and
development. There are still critical technical issues that need further developing before a
wide-scale application of autonomous driving can be considered and this provides
opportunities for new entrants. There are also uncertainties regarding which technologies
may win out in the long run.
8.6
Conclusion
Since there are already numerous technological solutions being implemented that are
linked to various societal goals (e.g. e-mobility, intermodal solutions, strengthening public
transport), autonomous driving will have to be debated in the context of these (competing
or complementary) technological paths. Discussions about future mobility possibilities
and the role that could be played by autonomous or partially or highly automated vehicles
should be more inclusive. It should not be restricted to an arena primarily concerned with
technical and legal questions such as the round table in Germany. Other stakeholders such
as non-governmental organizations or think tanks could be integrated into existing
structures (stakeholder platforms, legal processes, etc.), but new arenas could also be
created. In parallel, advisory bodies could be set up to assess not only technological
advancements and needs, but also social, environmental, and regulatory implications of
greater use of autonomous driving technologies.

New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous
Driving: The Potential for Change
Barbara Lenz and Eva Fraedrich
9.1
Introduction
Transport is an expression for the satisfaction of mobility needs with different means of
transportation—for everyday travel, people walk, cycle, drive or take public transport.
There are two main groups here: people with a distinct preference for using private
vehicles, and people who prefer so-called “ecomobility”—the combination of public
transport with walking and cycling [1]. In addition, a group has been emerging for some
years of “multimodal” users, who no longer restrict themselves to a particular mode or
mix of modes, but rather exhibit a wide range of modal use in their personal repertoire
[1, 2]. This gradual transformation in behavior has coincided with the development of new
mobility concepts that, ﬁrstly, involve a further development of conventional carsharing
[3], but also supplement established ridesharing with new forms. New concepts already in
operation include ﬂexible carsharing ﬂeets, such as those of Car2Go, DriveNow and
Multicity, that are available as mobility services in cities in Germany, and across Europe
and the USA. In parallel to this has been the emergence of so-called peer-to-peer services,
where private owners make their vehicle available to a community of members via an
internet platform. On online platforms such as Mitfahrzentrale and Zimride, private
individuals offer rides on routes and at times when they themselves will travel in any case.
Additionally, more and more services such as Uber and Lyft are currently starting up,
where the distinction between (semi-)professional individual transportation, comparable to
taxi services, and “standard” ridesharing is not always so clear-cut. The new forms of car

and ridesharing services have primarily arisen in the major cities and metropolitan areas of
industrialized countries.
What is new, and also special, about these mobility concepts is the high degree of
ﬂexibility they offer users. Flexible carsharing vehicles are available at any time and for
any duration, with no pre-planning. The new ridesharing services are similarly ﬂexible,
although in this respect they resemble conventional taxis. One essential prerequisite for
the emergence of all new mobility concepts is the possibilities that information and
communications technology now offer for networking vehicles, users, and operators. This
is what makes fundamentally fast and easy access to vehicles or services via the internet or
smartphone apps possible in the ﬁrst place. Access, in the sense of the physical distance
between the user’s location and the vehicle, is still a hurdle, however, particularly in areas
where vehicle density is not very high.
With the introduction of autonomous vehicles, it seems possible to appreciably extend
and diversify existing mobility concepts. Accessing and egressing a vehicle is changing,
in that the user no longer goes to the vehicle, but the vehicle comes to the user. Vehicles
themselves are becoming usable for a wider section of the population, e.g. those with
impaired mobility. New forms of public transport are possible, also in the sense of further
blurring the boundaries between private and public transport.
This article aims to introduce these options and the expectations accompanying them,
concentrating on carsharing. First, we shall outline the current state of provision and usage
of so-called “new mobility concepts,” at the heart of which is carsharing. The main section
discusses the opportunities and challenges resulting from the introduction of autono-
mously driving vehicles into carsharing ﬂeets. There are currently a series of indications
that spontaneity and ﬂexibility could be particularly signiﬁcant factors in the use of new
mobility concepts (see [11, 13]). Precisely this increased spontaneity could be the starting
point for new mobility concepts with autonomous vehicles. The operators of ﬂexible
carsharing ﬂeets are already thinking on such lines [4].
9.2
Carsharing: “Core Application” of New Mobility Concepts
There has been carsharing in Germany and numerous other countries since about the
1980s. Carsharing is here understood as the operation of a ﬂeet of cars that is available
either in station-based or point-to-point systems. Every holder of a valid driver’s license
can register as a member of a carsharing organization—usually upon payment of a reg-
istration fee—and thus acquire access to the vehicles. The basic variations in carsharing
result from the spatial and temporal conditions for vehicle access, and also from the
business models; Fig. 9.1 summarizes the various concepts’ main features.
174
B. Lenz and E. Fraedrich
9.2.1
Station-Based Carsharing
The standard form of carsharing is station-based carsharing, where vehicles are furnished
at “collection points.” The user must pick up the vehicle there and bring it back to it. The
length of use is agreed in advance. In contrast to traditional rental cars, station-based
carsharing vehicles may be rented by the hour, as well as by the day, although hourly
rental is now also increasingly available among rental companies. Users pay a basic
annual fee and vehicle use is charged according to duration and mileage. This varies
according to organization or provider, and can also be adjusted according to demand,
depending on time of day and day of the week. There is no restricted area of operation.
When these services began, reserving vehicles largely took place over the phone; book-
ings are now also made on provider websites or mobile device applications.
At the time of writing (2014), station-based carsharing is available at approximately
3900 stations in 380 cities and municipalities in Germany [5, 6]. This also includes a
whole series of medium and small towns. There is already very good coverage in German
cities of over 100,000 inhabitants, while only 5 % of municipalities with less than 50,000
population have carsharing services available [7]. The 3900 stations are served by a ﬂeet
of 7700 vehicles from some 150 carsharing providers. The German market leader is
Deutsche Bahn (Flinkster), which owns around 55 % of the station-based ﬂeet [8, 9]. The
worldwide leader in standard carsharing, with a ﬂeet of about 10,000 vehicles in the USA,
Canada, the UK, Spain, and Austria, is the American company Zipcar, founded in 2000
and currently owned by the Avis Budget Group (as of August 2014).

9.2.2
Flexible (One-Way) Carsharing
New forms of carsharing have emerged in recent years. Especially in Germany, but also in
the UK and USA, a new type of commercial carsharing, known as “ﬂexible,” has
appeared. Its ﬂexibility mainly consists in not needing to previously arrange the time and
duration of use with the provider, and not having to pick the vehicle up, or bring it back, to
a speciﬁed location. Instead, the user collects the vehicle from wherever he comes across
it, and leaves it at any random position within an operating area deﬁned by the provider.
The user acquires information on what vehicles are available at a particular location on the
internet or via a smartphone app. In principle, a vehicle can also be rented “in passing,”
i.e. a user rents a parked, non-reserved vehicle on the street. It is also necessary to be
registered with the ﬂeet operator to use a vehicle, which is initiated via a chip card or,
most recently, directly via the user’s smartphone.
The worldwide leading corporation in ﬂexible carsharing is Car2Go, with more than
10,000 vehicles in 27 cities in Europe and North America (as of August 2014). In
Germany, ﬂexible carsharing providers have a combined ﬂeet of around 6250 vehicles [5].
These, however, are in service almost exclusively in large cities of more than 500,000
inhabitants such as Berlin, Hamburg or Munich. Furthermore, the operating areas do not
cover the entire territories of these cities, but are limited to a part of them, mainly the city
center, its bordering neighborhoods and “island zones” with high usage frequency. Apart
from a one-time registration fee, there are no further regular charges. Vehicle usage is
charged on a time-dependent scale, mostly per minute. As with station-based carsharing,
fuel costs are included in the fare. Moreover, parking fees are also included, which are
normally agreed on a ﬂat-rate basis between the provider and the municipality.
Flexible carsharing started as a pilot project of Car2Go, a Daimler Group company, in
2009 in Ulm (Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Other relevant operators by now include
DriveNow, active since 2011 and a venture by BMW and Sixt Autovermietung; and also
Multicity, a joint venture between Citroen and Deutsche Bahn that operates vehicles
powered purely by batteries. At the same time, new operators are increasingly attempting
to break into the market: Quicar, for example, which belongs to the Volkswagen group, or
Spotcar, which launched in Berlin in June 2014.
9.2.3
Peer-to-Peer Carsharing
Peer-to-peer carsharing—hiring out private cars between private individuals—is only in
the ﬁrst stages of evolving into the third form of carsharing systems using online com-
munication platforms. Precise user numbers are not yet available. In this system, bookings
are processed via an online platform. There are no picked up and dropped off stations.
Vehicles are instead picked up and drop off at specially agreed locations. A glance at a
web platform such as www.autonetzer.de is enough to show that this form of carsharing is
in no way limited to large cities, but can also be found in smaller cities and municipalities.
176
B. Lenz and E. Fraedrich
This would appear to conﬁrm Hampshire and Gaites’ assumption [10, p. 14] that
peer-to-peer carsharing is scalable in form—in contrast, for now at least, to commercial
carsharing. The ﬂeet composition is also markedly dynamic, as persons who are prepared
to offer their car do not appear to do so constantly, as a basic mode of behavior. The
ﬁndings of a study in Berlin instead suggest that car owners only make their vehicles
available at certain times, for example when they themselves use them at low levels due to
personal circumstances [11].
9.3
Users and Use of the New Mobility Concepts
The objectives associated with carsharing vary depending on the perspective of the parties
involved. The political context in Germany largely involves setting up the necessary
framework conditions to implement carsharing on the local level. The essential motives
here are to reduce private car trafﬁc volumes (as carsharing users also increase the share of
public transport in their modal split over the duration of their carsharing use), to con-
comitantly lower CO2 and air pollution emissions, and to shrinking the amount of land
used by non-moving car trafﬁc (see Chap. 19). Commercial operators, such as car man-
ufacturers (generally in cooperation with car rental companies) or transport service pro-
viders such as Deutsche Bahn, use carsharing to pursue product-related strategies.
Extending their provision with an (additional) mobility service, or offering their own
brand’s attractive vehicles, thus generating brand allegiance, are two examples. Other
motives for operating a carsharing ﬂeet include decidedly ecological aims, which have
essentially driven carsharing’s emergence, and which are adhered to by interest groups
and associations [12].
9.3.1
Users and Usage Conditions
Carsharing users in 2014 form a speciﬁc group in view of both composition and mobility
behavior. They are clearly above the population average in various respects: proportion of
under-40s, proportion of men, proportion of people with high levels of formal education
(high-school diploma, higher education graduate) and household income. This deviation
from the population mean is more highly pronounced for ﬂexible carsharing than
station-based [3]. Both types of carsharing are combined with a highly above-average use
of public transportation. Studies on carsharing use from 2014 show, for example, that
52 % of Flinkster customers in Berlin and 44 % of Munich Flinkster customers have a
public transport season ticket. A high proportion of DriveNow and Car2Go users are
likewise season-ticket holders: 43 and 38 % of DriveNow customers in Berlin and
Munich respectively [13, p. 12]; for Car2Go this ﬁgure stands at 40 % in Stuttgart and
50 % in Cologne [15, p. 13]. Nationally, the average for core-city dwellers is 33 % ([1],
9
New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous Driving …
177
authors’ own analysis; in Germany, ofﬁcial ﬁgures count all urban municipalities with
more than 100,000 inhabitants in the category of “core city”).
Good public transport or the possession of an own car currently appear to be essential
preconditions for carsharing use. Only in this way is one-way usage possible in the
ﬂexible carsharing variant. If the user had to organize those trips that are complementary
to his carsharing trip by himself, this would most likely be highly inconvenient. The
attractiveness of a system that allows for individual routes would clearly fall. In the case
of station-based carsharing, public transport is also often the main form of transport for
users. In many cases, carsharing vehicles represent a second, supplementary car, used as
needed, in car-owning households [16]. In order to meet this need, and in the sense of
creating a symbiosis, there has been long-standing cooperation between station-based
carsharing and public transport providers, now being replicated with the new ﬂexible
carsharing services [17].
9.3.2
The Carsharer—the “New Citizen” in a Sharing Economy?
Under the slogan “using not owning,” carsharing is frequently called on as an example for
the transformation from an ownership economy to a “sharing economy” [18, 19]. This
perhaps results from carsharing’s particular visibility, as an act that takes place in public
view. Behind this, however, possibly lies some astonishment at objects that are still seen
as status symbols being used by several random people in a rental system.
In fact, carsharing is one in a long line of trends where “goods” that were never
previously rentable are “shared” on a hire basis: owner occupied apartments, allotment
gardens, cars. Economists account for whether a good can be loaned (or not) by the
difference between the transaction costs accrued and the revenue that can be generated by
the rental. If there is a positive difference, the rental is justiﬁed, and the greater the
difference, the greater the interest in renting it out [20]. Renting something out only makes
sense for individuals, however, when they have a product they do not use to full capacity
—hence the renting out of cars when not in use, apartments when the owner or main
tenant is on holiday, and parking spaces in front of the house during the day, when the
owner is at work.
Looking at the effects of shared use essentially stems—at least in Germany—from the
debate surrounding the sustainable use of resources [21–23]. At aggregate level—re-
gional, national or even supra-national—sharing thus appears to be a possibility for saving
resources. On the individual level, in contrast, sharing does not mean consuming less, but
rather the opportunity of maintaining or even increasing consumption levels. Carsharing,
where members have at their disposal a wide choice of vehicles, even a selection of
vehicle types, can in fact be viewed as an example of this. It offers a range of consumer
goods, in this case in the form of vehicles, that outstrips what the majority of private
households could own themselves. On the aggregate level, less vehicles are needed (the
German Bundesverband Carsharing (BCS) quotes ﬁgures of 42 people sharing one
178
B. Lenz and E. Fraedrich
station-based vehicle and 70 persons sharing a ﬂexible one; [5]); on the individual level,
high mobility levels are nevertheless assured.
In its ﬁrst years, carsharing was often associated with attitudes where car driving is not
something done purely for its own sake. Car users with this attitude thus took no pleasure
in driving (see [21, p. 92]). Carsharing usage was instead motivated by a desire to counter
the environmental degradation for which users held the growing motorization of private
households responsible [12]. It is possible that this has fundamentally changed. For
instance, carsharing, in both station-based and ﬂexible forms, has evolved into a com-
mercial product. Moreover, studies on the use of ﬂexible carsharing have found that
aspects such as “attention received, appreciation experienced, fun and enthusiasm” are
absolutely essential motivations (see [24, p. 21]: approval ratings of the corresponding
statements between 38 and 86 %). Carsharing vehicles and their use here take on the
emotional and psychosocial functions that were previously ascribed to cars only in the
form of ownership [22]. Bardhi and Eckhardt view “sharing” (termed by the authors more
accurately as “access-based consumption”) as a deﬁning characteristic of a “liquid soci-
ety,” in which ﬁxed reference systems, such as those arising from property, increasingly
begin to crumble [24].
9.4
Digitalization of the Everyday World as a Basic
Precondition for New Mobility Concepts
The development and extension of carsharing via new concepts such as ﬂexible and
peer-to-peer carsharing is inconceivable without the availability of devices with mobile
internet access and communications applications. Every provider does indeed also present
their carsharing product extensively on the (stationary) internet, but this is more about
giving information to (potential) customers than immediate use of the service. To access
the vehicles, mobile applications in particular play an essential role. In the ﬁrst place, they
enable the user and vehicle to be located in real time. This allows users to see what
vehicles are available, and to decide whether they are willing, and able, to make the trip to
the vehicle (for which, depending on the provider, they currently are given between 15
and 30 min). As a second step, the mobile application allows the selected vehicle to be
reserved and offers navigation to it. With some operators, even opening the vehicle can
already today be done via the app.
The potential use of such technologies thus depends largely on users being technically
equipped to access the online choice of available vehicles via mobile. Rates of private
smartphone ownership have in fact considerably risen in recent years. While only around
6.5 million Germans owned a smartphone in 2009, this ﬁgure stands at over 40 million
today, almost every second person. For 2014, it is expected that 97 % of all mobile phone
sales will be smartphones; sales of almost 30 million devices are forecast [25, 26].
At the same time, it may be assumed that hardware and software skills are increasing in
all population groups. In 2013, for example, a study found that the number of internet
9
New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous Driving …
179
users continues to expand [27]: in 2013, 54.2 million people in Germany were online at
least occasionally. That is 77.2 % of the population, and an increase of 800,000 people on
the previous year. The driver of this growth is exclusively the over-50s. Time spent online
is rising concurrently: the average German internet user was online for an average of
169 min a day in 2013, 36 min more than the previous year. A considerable proportion of
this was mobile internet use, practiced by only 23 % of users in 2012, but already by 41 %
in 2013. Apps are used by almost half of online users (44 %) on various end devices [28].
In the transport context, what particularly stands out is the ever greater possibility of
reducing planning horizons arising from digital applications and mobile devices. Spon-
taneity in organizing individual mobility is thus a particularly important connotation of
“ﬂexibility,” the most common among the speciﬁc qualities of the new mobility concepts.
Correspondingly, the statement with the highest approval rating in a 2014 survey of
Car2Go users was: “What I ﬁnd attractive about Car2Go is that I can use a car sponta-
neously, even when I am out and about without one”—98 % of respondents agreed with
this statement (for 72 % it was “highly accurate”, for 26 % it was “quite accurate”) (see
[15, p. 20]). This also goes to explaining the quick success of ﬂexible carsharing, which is
released from the (long) pre-planning required for conventional station-based carsharing.
At least in the medium term, it could also take on the advantage that private cars have
enjoyed until now of being permanently available (on this, see also [22, p. 64]).
Overall, this means that almost no barriers to access on the part of the (potential) users
should be expected, provided that future mobility concepts tie in with what is already
currently practiced (“practiced” in the true sense of the word; for an analogous compar-
ison, see the acquisition by repeated practice in the interaction between humans and
computers in vehicle navigation systems in Chap. 3). Less likely, even if repeatedly cited
by the scientiﬁc community, is the conversion of the entire vehicle ﬂeet into vehicles that
are on the road on a sharing basis or operated by public transport providers. There are
currently no indications that private cars are losing any of their attraction. According to
the Federal Motor Transport Authority (Kraftfahrtbundesamt, or KBA), vehicle stocks in
Germany reached record levels on 1 January 2014, rising by around 500,000 vehicles
between 2013 and 2014. This accords with long-term trends [29].
9.5
Can New Mobility Concepts Be Further Developed
via Carsharing’s Automation?
There are a series of variants for the further development of existing carsharing concepts
using autonomous vehicles, which run in parallel to the use cases outlined in Chap. 2.
These variants are aimed at different user needs which are already being addressed, albeit
via a human driver. In the following, we shall discuss the “Full Automation Using Driver
for Extended Availability,” “Autonomous Valet Parking,” and “Vehicle on Demand” use
cases, and also ask: What changes would carsharing experience with an inﬂux of
180
B. Lenz and E. Fraedrich
autonomous vehicles? What effects can be expected for the user? Competition with
currently existing transport provision will also be addressed.
In all use cases, the highest degree of automation is assumed—“fully automated,”
according to the nomenclature of the German Federal Highway Research Institute
(Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen, or BASt) [30]. The difference in the cases lies in the
uses encompassed in their deﬁnition. Autonomous Valet Parking, for instance, exclusively
involves picking up and parking vehicles. Full Automation Using Driver for Extended
Availability, on the other hand, covers every conceivable use in road trafﬁc, even if the
emphasis is on situations with comparatively simple trafﬁc mixes, such as freeway trafﬁc,
where high speeds also prevail. In this use case, the driver must take over the driving task
at certain times and on certain route sections where clearance for autonomous driving has
been temporarily or permanently withheld. A Vehicle on Demand is likewise in a position
to deal with any potential usage scenario, including those with mixed trafﬁc. By
renouncing the so-called driver’s workplace—the seat from which the driver performs the
driving task—the potential uses of the vehicle interior increase greatly in comparison to
Valet Parking or Full Automation.
9.5.1
Autonomous Valet Parking in Carsharing
The Autonomous Valet Parking use case starts from the assumption that the vehicle will
be able to independently move from parking space to user and vice versa, even on public
roads.
The use of Autonomous Valet Parking in carsharing would initially mean that the effort
required for the user to procure the vehicle and park it after use would fall considerably.
Instead, from the user’s point of view, there would be a door-to-door service—comparable
to taking a taxi, although one in which the user takes over the driving task for the actual
journey. The overall travelling time would in any case be reduced with the shortened time
and distance for accessing and egressing the vehicle.
In order to make the service more attractive, various enhancements would be possible,
regardless of automation. These could be options in vehicle features: number of seats,
carrying capacity, internet access, and multi-media provision. How greatly the options
differ would depend—as with today’s carsharing—on the ﬂeet size, the number of (po-
tential) customers per vehicle and the size of the operating area, and also on the readiness
of customers to pay for various optional features. In a large ﬂeet, it would also be possible
to have a differentiated price scale for different vehicles, comparable to that currently
found in station-based carsharing and traditional car rental. This is in contrast to current
ﬂexible carsharing business models, which possibly have the added attraction for users
that they can use a large range of vehicles from the current ﬂeets for the same price.
With Autonomous Valet Parking, providing vehicles at a station becomes essentially
superﬂuous. Carsharing provision as a whole could thus be made ﬂexible—at least in that
fetching and returning the vehicle would be unnecessary. The operators, of course, would
9
New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous Driving …
181
still need their stations or vehicle depots to keep things centralized to a certain extent,
which is more efﬁcient for vehicle maintenance. These stations, though, would no longer
need to be built in the greatest possible proximity to customers, but could instead use
low-cost land. The distance to the journey/start end points is not arbitrary here, however,
as there may be a relatively small time window for getting to the customer. Moreover, the
journey to the customer also uses resources and is also “dead” time if no other use is
possible for the vehicle on the way.
As an alternative, or supplement, to this, numerous smaller collection points with a few
vehicles could be spread relatively densely across the operating area. This would keep the
time between ordering and picking up a vehicle down. A mixed form of vehicle ordering
with optional autonomous collection or picking up in person would also be possible. This
would signiﬁcantly even out access times, which currently still differ widely, depending
on the density of available vehicles. At present, access times, calculated on the difference
between the measured values of “time of booking/reservation” and “journey duration,” are
between 1 and 16 min (e.g. DriveNow with a maximum reservation time of 15 min;
source: WiMobil project, supported by the German Federal Environment Ministry
(BMUB)). The differences in average access times are closely linked to the various trip
purposes.
9.5.2
Carsharing Used as “Full Automation Using Driver
for Extended Availability”
The use case of Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability assumes that
vehicles will basically be able to move autonomously on public roads, but that the driving
task can be taken over by the driver independently from time to time.
From a carsharing perspective, the potential changes and extensions involving “Full
Automation” are far smaller than those of Autonomous Valet Parking, at least when
drivers are required for on-hand availability in the vehicle. The only difference to today’s
carsharing that would result from this use case would be the possibility of letting the
vehicle drive during the trip, should the driver wish. Autonomous driving may also be
permanently proscribed on some route sections, however, “e.g. roads with a high fre-
quency of pedestrians crossing” (see Chap. 2). This would primarily be areas in urban
districts which—at least for now—form ﬂexible carsharing’s main usage areas.
Accordingly, upgrading carsharing with fully automated vehicles, with the driver
available for extended range, would be more likely to ﬁnd use on routes at the edge of or
outside settlements. But this is hardly the basis for a business model for “carsharing in
rural areas,” however. The necessity of having a driver available would prevent serving
operating areas with a vehicle that drives to and from the customer autonomously.
Overall, the use of Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability offers far
less potential than that resulting from Autonomous Valet Parking.
182
B. Lenz and E. Fraedrich
9.5.3
Carsharing as Vehicle on Demand
The Vehicle on Demand use case assumes an autonomously moving vehicle on all public
roads. A driver is—even as a fall-back option—not necessary. A driver workstation is thus
no longer required, which opens up new design possibilities for the vehicle interior.
A carsharing vehicle on demand starts with the same advantages as a carsharing vehicle
with a valet parking function, but in addition the vehicle can become a kind of “com-
partment on the road.” As a result, very diverse activities are possible in these vehicles,
such as reading, playing, telephoning, working or taking a nap, and the user can sit
anywhere they choose. If we assume usage durations similar to those generally found in
today’s ﬂexible carsharing, however, it remains open to question whether these additional
uses would in fact be highly valued—the average usage duration of a vehicle in a ﬂeet
such as that of DriveNow, for instance, was roughly only half an hour in 2014 [31]. If we
assume that autonomously driving vehicles will be used for all work journeys in the
course of a day, this time span would come to an average of 54 min in large cities at
today’s rates. For those living in surrounding areas of large cities or in rural areas, the total
time spent on travelling to work on a weekday is currently 49–50 min (data source: MiD
2008 [1]). There is, then, almost no difference in the time spent making work journeys
with cars in various types of geographical areas (Fig. 9.2).
Carsharing in a Vehicle on Demand would be similar to a taxi ride, and because the
vehicle would be available to a wide circle of users, it would most probably replace taking
taxis. But the costs of taking an autonomous carsharing vehicle should be compared to
those of taking a taxi.

9.5.4
Interim Summary
If we compare the various possible uses of autonomous vehicles in carsharing, the vehicle
user gains in comfort from automating the driving task, in a way that is not essentially any
different from private vehicles. In carsharing, the travelling time is also free for any other
activities that can be carried out in the vehicle during the journey. The decisively novel
type of use likely to emerge for carsharing would be delivering the vehicle to the user and
disposing of it after use.
The user’s prospects are different to those of the operators, who, with the automation of
pick up and drop off, will achieve increased usage frequency and overall usage duration
for a single vehicle, which could increase carsharing’s proﬁtability. This would at least
even out differences in usage frequency that show up in studies on ﬂexible carsharing.
Currently, usage frequency is directly related to the location at which the vehicle is left.
Hotspots in inner-city districts stand in contrast to places where most vehicles parked there
wait unused for several hours (Fig. 9.3). Operators currently put average usage duration at
between 68 and 78 min per vehicle per day [32], which shows that there is still room for
these vehicles to be utilized at greater capacities.

value the more bookings are made). A low value equals a low number of bookings (the lower the
value the lesser bookings are made)

9.6
New Mobility Concepts Beyond Carsharing: Hybridization
of Public Transportation?
While carsharing attracts particular attention, especially in its new ﬂexible variant, and
also in connection with vehicle automation, it is often overlooked that new options for
(further) diversiﬁcation in current public transport provision could also result, with further
new forms of mobility concepts emerging. It also is vital here to take the relevant local
conditions into account.
The basic options to be discussed in connection with public transport involve:
– redesigning intermodality and transition to a more ﬂexible form
of public
transportation
– individualizing public transportation
– expanding public transportation service options
The particular beneﬁt that would arise from the use of autonomous vehicles here
especially concern demand-driven services: Fixed route plans could be supplemented by
ﬂexible services. The additional routes could be optimized according to customer
requirements. Fixed timetables would be replaced by temporally optimized routings
corresponding to customer demands.
This individualization of public transport will, then, amount to “hybridization” at the
latest when, beyond the ﬂexibilization of times and routes, options regarding the vehicles
available are also on offer. In essence, the idea of diversifying public transport via
vehicle-speciﬁc provision is not new. Until now, however, it has only been possible to
introduce this in very limited, mostly tourist-centered niches, due to the costs of manning
the various ﬂeets with the required staff (e.g. Cable Car in San Francisco, the Glacier
Express in Switzerland, or the Blue Train in South Africa).
9.6.1
Reshaping Intermodality and Making Public Transport More
Flexible
Intermodality is deﬁned as the change between different transport modes in the course of a
journey [33]. According to this deﬁnition, intermodal behavior exists only to a very
limited extent, at least in Germany. According to the study “Mobility in Germany 2008,”
it only applies to 1.3 % of all day-to-day journeys [1]. What is overlooked here, though, is
the considerable amount of intermodality within public transport, particularly in the
linking of main routes with access and egress routes. A typical example of this is
accessing commuter or regional trains on a bus line, as is often the set-up in suburban and
rural areas. In cities, intermodality between the various modes of metro, commuter train,
trams, and bus is much more pronounced. The situation in urban peripheral areas and less
densely populated (rural) districts is outlined below. Heinrichs discusses comparable
scenarios for cities elsewhere in this volume (see Chap. 11).
9
New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous Driving …
185
Reshaping intermodality by using autonomous vehicles could take place along the
same lines as the current system, using private cars or public means. In day-to-day
transport, getting to and from the main lines would to some extent correspond to what is
today known as “kiss and ride”: One person drives another to the main route transport
mode, bids goodbye and takes the car with them so they can use it (generally in the
daytime) for other purposes during the other person’s absence. With an autonomous
vehicle, the ﬁrst person would not need to do the driving, as no driver would be needed to
be present for the return trip. The kiss-and-ride pattern can also be found in similar form
for long-distance transport, where carsharing operators have also begun, incidentally, to
introduce special services for getting to and from airports, train and long-distance bus
stations. These include reserved parking spaces at airports, and special rates for intermodal
use of long-distance buses and carsharing vehicles [34].
If travelling to and from main lines is done on a public system, it will be possible, by
means of autonomous driving, to target user requirements far more closely. Fixed routes
and timetables could be dropped in favor of individually arranged pick-up times and
locations. A larger ﬂeet of small and medium-sized vehicles would probably be used for
these journeys; the local public transport system would be one of a multitude of collective
taxis with tailored capacities. Despite automation, the logistical challenges would be
enormous. There is also the essential precondition for a functioning system that the user
sticks to the agreement with the operator very reliably. This is especially true regarding
departure times, for instance when ﬁxed schedules on the main line, or at least ﬁxed
timetables, are involved.
Such a transformation of the system could also breathe new life into ideas of ﬁnancing
basic public-transportation services—on the one hand in the form of pay-as-you-drive, but
also on a ﬂat-rate basis ﬁnanced via taxes or levied on all citizens, as is often debated for
cities. Also, a high service density in suburban and even rural areas would justify a
ﬂat-rate levy and could in the process help to reduce private car use.
9.6.2
Individualization of Public Transport
Individualizing public transport via autonomous vehicles could, then, go beyond abol-
ishing ﬁxed routes and timetables if it actually came to reducing vehicle sizes—at least in
certain parts of the areas served. This would open up the possibility of offering users
different vehicle types and features, which presently only exists in a rather rudimentary
form with ﬁrst and second classes on public transport, and even there only really on
medium- and long-distance trains.
One possible ﬁrst step in individualizing public transport could be company buses,
such as the so-called Google Bus, equipped with WiFi access and operating in and around
San Francisco, which brings the company’s employees to work. In this case, a speciﬁc
community gets together in a communal shuttle. Comparable concepts, albeit in manifold
186
B. Lenz and E. Fraedrich
varieties, are conceivable and appear particularly attractive when based on autonomously
driven vehicles.
Parallel to this—also as a private initiative—the development of new carpooling
concepts is also possible, which could mean a mix of common ownership and use of the
vehicle, though it may be used individually at times too. Today, carpooling is essentially
restricted to ridesharing organizations, where journeys are planned in the medium or short
term, and the vehicle is provided and driven by the owner. Even new services such as
Uber (www.uber.com) or Lyft (www.lyft.com) do not deviate from this principle. What
they offer is taxi-like services, and are thus not comparable with the standard carpooling
communities, which predominantly consist of ﬁxed groups of people. It seems reasonable
to assume that carpooling services will become obsolete with the rise of autonomous
vehicles, and evolve into peer-to-peer carsharing.
9.6.3
Broadening Service Options in Public Transport
Concerning intermodality, possibilities include more public transport services, even in the
suburban and rural areas mentioned above (for urban areas, see Chap. 11). The beneﬁts
resulting from the use of autonomous vehicles are equally true in spatial and temporal
terms, that is both for districts on the outskirts and off-peak hours. An economic lower
limit resulting from frequency of use also applies here, however, even in view of the saved
labor costs. This also means that a spatially highly dispersed use can only be covered to a
limited extent by providing larger ﬂeets. In any case, operating these vehicles would have
to pay for itself in terms of initial outlay and operating costs.
9.7
Implementing New Mobility Concepts with Autonomous
Vehicles
Carsharing is currently causing quite a stir, in part due to the new forms it is developing,
its increasing visibility, and how abruptly its user base has grown in the last two years. But
beyond that, carsharing, which in its commercial or group forms is independent of private
car ownership, seems well cut-out for introducing new vehicle technologies into the
market. Users get to use and try out new technology in providers’ vehicle ﬂeets, without
the costs of doing so that comes with conventional vehicle ownership. In fact, this is
already taking place with electric mobility, where companies such as Car2Go, DriveNow
and Citroen’s Multicity service are incorporating electric vehicles into their ﬂeets. The
user response has been markedly positive. On this point, projects have reported two
aspects of electric-mobility carsharing: Firstly, the new technology has been successfully
and speedily furnished for a large section of carsharing users; this has stimulated its use.
Secondly, many users actively seek out the option that carsharing gives of testing and
using new technologies [13, p. 15; 15, p. 19].

New Mobility Concepts and Autonomous Driving …
187
The introduction of autonomous vehicles into public transport may be more difﬁcult,
even if automated rail and metro lines have so far largely been positively received, e.g.
Linie 1 of the Paris Metro, fully automated since 2012 [35], or the metro line to
Nuremberg Airport [36]. But the spatial separation of rail tracks provides for different
conditions than would most likely be the case on the roads. If autonomous vehicles were
also tied to a rigid infrastructure in road transport, then not only would considerable costs
result, but the possibility of more ﬂexible navigation would also be lost. Testing the
deployment of autonomous vehicles in prescribed, small-scale public or semi-public areas,
as described in Chap. 10, thus assumes especial importance. A comparably open “ex-
perimental philosophy” is not currently visible in many places.
9.8
Conclusion
Further developing carsharing systems and changing public transportation through the
deployment of autonomous vehicles appears in essence possible, and is in many places
also linked to clearly deﬁned beneﬁts for road users. In carsharing, the use of fully
automated pick-up and drop-off services, in the sense of Valet Parking, seems to almost be
a logical and necessary consequence if carsharing’s availability and use are to be extended
further in the medium-term.
We can already see that numerous new ideas concerning car and ridesharing are
cropping up and being tested out, which could have an even greater potential when
combined with autonomous vehicles. Carpooling schemes are being developed, for
instance, that have an additional “care” aspect, not only for elderly people, but also for
children—as “Boost by Mercedes Benz” is demonstrating in Palo Alto, California. We
also see here the close interconnection between mobility and information and commu-
nications technology when organizing such services [37].
The question of costs and proﬁtability are currently completely open; possibly this
question should be linked to that of ﬁnancing the system. On the user side, it also remains
to be seen whether, and to what extent, users come to accept pay-as-you-drive carsharing
set ups. Experiments in this area are also only at initial stages. For example, in their
current version, Spotcar are positioning a distance-based charging scale against Car2Go
and DriveNow’s time-dependent pricing, in order to avoid immediate cost penalties for
customers stuck and delayed in city trafﬁc. The pay-as-you-drive era is only just beginning
in public transport, for instance with systems such as Touch&Travel. It may well be,
however, that such payment systems in carsharing, and comparable ones in public
transport, are merely forerunners of a highly ﬂexible system.

Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles
with Higher-Order Automation
Sven Beiker
10.1
Introduction and Background
Tragically, trafﬁc accidents continue to be an everyday aspect of motor vehicle operation
as evidenced by statistics. In the United States, for instance, there are approximately
33,000 trafﬁc fatalities per year [1]; in Germany, the ﬁgure is roughly 3300 [2]. Vehicle
automation, or the gradual delegation of driving from humans to computers, promises to
drastically curtail the frequency and severity of accidents. Beyond that, automating
vehicles will improve the overall coordination among them, improving the efﬁciency,
comfort, convenience, and safety of personal mobility.
Automated highways and vehicles have been the subject of research and development
for over ﬁve years now. The question is: how realistic is the vision of humans delegating
driving to computers in the near future? Currently, several different development routes
are apparent. On one side, the established auto industry is developing “driver assistance
systems” with automated driving as the ultimate goal. Meanwhile, non-automotive
technology companies from the IT sector have identiﬁed automated driving as a new
business area for their core products, while recent start-ups are harnessing advanced
technology to edge their way into the ﬁeld of automated personal mobility. A closer look
reveals that the players listed above have varying strengths and product goals, but are all
driven by a common mission: to shape a new model of personal mobility that is safer,
more efﬁcient, more comfortable, and more convenient. This chapter will draw a com-
parison between these development trends and players.
The development trends will be treated as distinct deployment scenarios, each one a
potential projection of how the introduction of vehicles with higher-order automation

might play out. The scenarios were developed primarily by extrapolating publicly
available knowledge on the state of the art for automated vehicles and projecting progress
forward, while accounting for the outside factors of infrastructure, economics, and
technology.
10.2
Definition and Scope
Automated vehicles, also known as “autonomous,” “driverless,” or “self-driving”
vehicles, are currently the subject of extensive discussion in the general public, are being
researched by universities, and developed by the auto industry. This article focuses on
road vehicles, paying particular attention to passenger vehicles and to some extent trucks.
It excludes trains, aircraft, and ships.
In general, the vehicles under consideration are operated on public roads; however, the
discussion of synergies will also address vehicles that operate in restricted areas such as
company premises, amusement parks, or pedestrian zones. Distinct from public roadways,
possible usages in these restricted and/or partially public areas are salient because they
allow us to observe critical interactions between automated vehicles and the public, which
is ultimately to the advantage of their deployment in general road trafﬁc. The individual
implementation scenarios cover such cases in more detail.
This chapter will follow the taxonomy of automated driving and automated vehicles
deﬁned by SAE International as J3016 [3], which distinguishes between assistance, partial
automation, conditional automation, high automation, and full automation.
To highlight the area under focus, this chapter introduces the term “higher-order
automation,” which encompasses driving with conditional, high, or full automation. These
categories merit emphasis because the step beyond the partially automated scenario—the
point at which the driver no longer has to monitor the vehicle or system continuously—
entails a fundamental change in what it means to drive a car. The radical shift is that the
driver can then pursue other tasks during the trip besides operating the vehicle. Finally, a
“driverless” vehicle would not even require a human driver whatsoever. This will pave the
way to utterly new models for the operation and enterprise of personal mobility.
10.3
Development Trends in Automated Driving
The motives for deploying automated driving—safety, efﬁciency, extended mobility,
comfort, and convenience—can be observed for various trends in this ﬁeld. The individual
aspects are apparent to varying degrees and depend considerably on the intended
deployment area and purpose of use. The sections below will examine this in more depth
by discussing the currently observed development trends. To start off, the next three
subsections describe the deployment scenarios, reﬂecting the current discourse among
both experts and the general public.
194
S. Beiker
10.3.1 Continuous Improvement of Driver Assistance: Evolutionary
Scenario
One of the principal players in automated driving is the auto industry, comprising both
vehicle manufacturers and system suppliers. The auto industry has been concerned foremost
with advancing driver assistance systems, or technology that supports the driver in oper-
ating the vehicle. Over nearly four decades, such systems have been introduced to both
passenger and commercial vehicles, assisting drivers with longitudinal and, increasingly,
lateral control. These systems include anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic stability
control (ESC), adaptive cruise control (ACC), and lane-keeping assist, among others.
Figure 10.1 shows a timeline for the deployment of these systems. To date, these have
emphasized increasing safety and, in some cases, comfort and convenience. The
“evolutionary scenario” refers to the steady increase in the use of advanced driver
assistance systems followed by successive steps towards vehicle automation and a cor-
responding reduction in the driver’s responsibilities. This is one of the three deployment
scenarios to be compared in this chapter.
For the ﬁrst time in production vehicles, the auto industry is currently launching a suite
of systems that automates both longitudinal (acceleration, braking) and lateral control
(steering), with driver monitoring still to be introduced—in other words, a partially
automated system. This suite of systems, often called a “trafﬁc jam assistant” [4–6],
presents a setting that combines adaptive cruise control (automated longitudinal control)
with lane-keeping assist (automated lateral control) and thus automates control of the
vehicle along both longitudinal and lateral axes in slow-moving trafﬁc. In this mode, the
driver’s role is merely to supervise the system and intervene if needed.

Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
195
The next anticipated development stage is the increasing automation of parking. Today
there are already many production vehicles that substantially facilitate the processes of
both angled and parallel parking [7]. However, these systems tend only to take over the
task of steering, the part that many drivers ﬁnd more difﬁcult, leaving them in control of
the accelerator and the brake. As such, these present-day systems fall under the category
of assisted driving. In the near future, a growing number of partially automated parking
solutions are expected to offer not only system-controlled steering, but acceleration and
braking as well. Then the driver’s role is merely to monitor the system, for instance by
pressing one button throughout the parking process—which remains a signal of the
driver’s attention and responsibility [8].
The recent past has witnessed statements by various automakers announcing the year
2020 as the target for “autonomous” driving [9–11]. Since the term “autonomous” does
not have a set deﬁnition according to organizations like SAE International, the automation
level implied by these announcements cannot be stated with certainty. Still, it is fair to
assume that their functionality would move signiﬁcantly beyond partial automation and
maybe even enter the realm of high automation. In such a design, the driver would not
even need to take over in an emergency within speciﬁcally deﬁned use cases and zones,
for the system is able to perform all driving tasks on its own including responding to
unforeseen circumstances.
These announcements, often accompanied by public demonstrations of vehicles with
higher-order automation, also show that many well-known automakers and system sup-
pliers are currently working on designs to propel the evolution of driver assistance
towards higher-order automation [10, 12, 13]. To that end, in keeping with the mission
described at the beginning, trafﬁc safety is treated as the number one objective with further
increases in efﬁciency, comfort, and convenience seen as added beneﬁts.
However, it is hardly possible to make predictions beyond the target date of 2020. Even
though several market analysis reports and even some automakers themselves have raised
prospects of full automation by 2025 [12], this should be seen more as a possible mile-
stone in the evolution of driver assistance toward automated driving, and not as a reliable
forecast of when particular system capabilities and features will be available. Due to their
far-off time horizon, projections of that scope should be considered with caution.
Under the evolutionary deployment scenario, we can assume that it would take quite a
while for a signiﬁcant share of vehicles on public roads to have higher-order automation
even if such vehicles were for sale as mass-market vehicles by 2020. In the past, it has
usually taken around 15–20 years before a technology like ABS or ESC becomes a
standard on all new vehicles or is at least available as an extra option [14]. Since the
vehicle ﬂeet is generally only replaced over the course of 20 years [15], we should hardly
expect most vehicles to run without driver interaction in the foreseeable future under the
evolutionary development scenario. Accordingly, this scenario is a more longsighted but
also more predictable approach, particularly in comparison to the scenario described next.
196
S. Beiker
10.3.2 Redesigning Personal Mobility: Revolutionary Scenario
Since 2010, non-automotive technology companies [16] have been known to be working
on automated vehicles. Unlike the evolutionary scenario pursued by the auto industry and
described above, these businesses are promoting a revolutionary scenario with the stated
goal to “prevent trafﬁc accidents, free up people’s time, and reduce carbon emissions by
fundamentally changing car use” [16]. It can be concluded based on such announcements
and published design descriptions that these players are not pursuing the continuous
improvement of driver assistance towards automated driving, but rather a disruptive leap
straight from today’s trafﬁc pattern, with human-driven vehicles, into a scenario in which
the driver hands over control to the system completely. Obviously this vision is one of
fully or at least highly automated driving.
The key design feature from non-automotive technology companies is the inclusion of
artiﬁcial intelligence. In other words, the functionality of automated driving is imple-
mented by means of learning algorithms rather than the closed arithmetic designs that tend
to be pursued by the auto industry. This approach attempts to close the gap between a
purely analytical system operating within narrow boundaries and a rule-based system
mimicking human behavior. The reason for using learning systems of that kind is that they
can improve their features, such as object recognition, over time and learn from the user’s
behavior and preferences. Those are rather unusual traits for a vehicle from the auto
industry, which conventionally introduces a product with its full range of features that then
remain static and unaltered. In the computer industry, by contrast, it is standard to
introduce a product and then steadily extend its range of functions, whether through
learning algorithms or periodic software updates.
Whereas the deployment strategy under the auto industry’s previously discussed
evolutionary scenario seems relatively straightforward, the same is not necessarily the
case in this revolutionary scenario. After all, these are players from the IT industry with no
prior experience with automobiles [17–21], and they are pursuing a highly complex goal
in an area outside their specialty that may not ﬁt well with their core business. Although it
is public knowledge that these ﬁrms have already driven several hundred thousand miles
in vehicles with higher-order automation [22], their ultimate product goals remain unclear.
To date, the players pursuing this revolutionary scenario have made scant mention of
tangible plans for any launches on the market, and it is unsure whether these
non-automotive technology companies intend to establish themselves as vehicle manu-
facturers [23, 24]. So far, a range of deployment deadlines have been estimated [25, 26],
which in conjunction with other observations in the ﬁeld give way to the following
deployment scenarios.
It is conceivable that the test drives of vehicles with higher-order automation that are
currently underway will serve as a platform for the acquisition and subsequent usage of
maps and images aiding automated driving. The non-automotive technology companies
could then offer services and online software products as part of automated driving and
thus propel vehicle automation forward on a broad level. If so, the associated mapping and
10
Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
197
graphical information could be furnished for broader use, which would be more consistent
with a continuous rather than a revolutionary deployment of automation.
However, once the vehicle is driving self-sufﬁciently without the need for supervision,
the goal of those non-automotive technology companies might be for the driver to con-
sume the products from their core business, i.e. online services. In that case these players’
strategy would be taking quite a long-term view focused on revenue in their core business:
the attempt to conquer the remaining segments of the market—transportation—as part of
connected lifestyle. In other words, if the drivers were surﬁng the web or using social
media during the trip, that would make them potential customers for online services just as
much as any other computer user.
Another deployment scenario that seems a better match for the industry’s tendencies and
also allows for a revolutionary development can be deduced from the industry’s public
design descriptions [24], press releases [22] and patents [27]. On that basis, the deployment
of vehicles with higher-order (perhaps even full) automation for services such as the
transportation of passengers [28–30] and goods [31] appears possible even within the near
future. One credible possibility could be the introduction of vehicles with higher-order
automation as competitors of conventional taxis. Press releases [22] and media reports [24]
seem to favor a deployment scenario along those lines, though they provide only sparse
details about the true objectives and development stage of the technical implementation.
This use case is described in this book under the category “vehicle on demand.”
One variation of automated taxicabs is the idea of delivery services with higher-order
automation, such as food deliveries [32–34] home delivery from local retail outlets [31], or
deliveries of any sort of products ordered online [18]. Designs for those kinds of applications
have already been demonstrated publicly. Based on strategic investments and acquisitions of
the leading companies in these areas, the increasing automation of product delivery is a
potential application of vehicle automation. Trials of “drones” for delivering goods [18, 32,
33] and automated garbage removal [35] may also point in that direction (Chap. 16).
Even though many questions remain unanswered, this decade may yet see a large step
towards higher-order vehicle automation. This may seem minor and very limited at ﬁrst
(for example, fully automated taxis in one neighborhood), but its implementation area
could grow rapidly along with its market share. Announcements by leading companies
support the hypothesis that vehicles with higher-order automation will be rolled out before
2020 [22].
By starting with a limited deployment, non-automotive technology companies would
have the opportunity to start gathering ample experience and data in the near-term,
including the public reaction to these novel concepts. That would pave the way for them to
apply their insights to expansion on a regional, national, and ﬁnally global scale.
A deployment strategy of this sort would be anomalous for the auto industry and could
even damage the reputation of a company that tried it. For non-automotive technology
companies, however, it is standard practice. Indeed there are examples from past product
launches where it has even beneﬁted companies’ reputations, as a limited introduction
entails a certain kind of exclusivity [36, 37].

10.3.3 Merging Personal Mobility and Public Transportation:
Transformative Scenario
Another deployment scenario for automated driving involves implementing transportation
paradigms that provide slow-moving passenger vehicles, for example in urban areas.
Consumers could summon such vehicles using a smartphone app and ride them over
relatively short distances (see the use case “vehicle on demand”). Key drivers behind these
types of schemes tend to be high-tech start-ups but may also include transportation service
providers, municipalities and operators of facilities such as amusement parks. Their goal is
to combine the advantages of personal mobility (independence and ﬂexibility) with those
of public transportation (efﬁcient use of energy and space) in order to achieve the mission
described at the beginning with a priority on reducing urban trafﬁc congestion (Chap. 9).
Start-ups are motivated to enter these areas in order to develop new business models
and deploy new technologies. In particular, companies from unrelated sectors can use
image processing, object recognition, and route planning systems—which are already in
widespread
modular
use—to
implement
transportation
models
with
higher-order
automation within a limited geographical range. The arrangements often proposed for
market introduction are slow-moving and limited-area vehicles intended to serve what is
known as the “ﬁrst or last mile,” complementary to private automobiles or public trans-
portation. To name one concrete example, these types of solutions could be used to reach
bus and urban rail networks in areas where a regular schedule is not feasible due to
inadequate
infrastructure
or
ﬁnancial limitations.
Another
example
might
be
a
“park-and-ride” system, whereby users drive their cars to a parking lot on the perimeter of
a city or amusement park and transfer to a locally run transportation service. These
arrangements would be favored for use primarily in places where private cars are not
convenient or permitted or where buses with set schedules are not ﬂexible enough.
These transportation solutions would compete with conventional taxis but be more
affordable, comfortable, and innovative from the standpoints of both users and operators
[38]. Based on their features, these arrangements have also been called automated
mobility on demand (AMOD) systems. They represent an individualization of public
transportation with the aim of transforming trafﬁc in urban areas (Chaps. 9, 11). Com-
panies’ incentive to introduce such arrangements is to gain access to new business areas or
extend their range within existing markets. Currently, the taxi industry’s business model
has comparatively high labor costs. Automated vehicles’ reduced need for human
resources is anticipated to boost proﬁts [38], though it would be accompanied by a
reduction in employment in the sector.
It is quite conceivable that, by merging personal mobility and public transportation,
automated vehicles will usher in a transformation of urban street trafﬁc. Since these
systems are only intended for a limited geographical range and would operate at low
speeds, the difﬁculties are correspondingly reduced, and they would be much easier to
implement in the near term than the ﬁrst two scenarios discussed here. As such, it seems
realistic that various cases of AMODs will be rolled out with limited scope by 2020.
10
Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
199
Some early examples of the transformative scenario are already being implemented or
are scheduled for the near future [24, 39–43]. It should be noted that a number of cities
have conditions consistent with these use cases, allowing the operation of AMOD systems
on a trial basis at the least. During the trial period, it remains to be seen whether residents
will take advantage of the services and whether this will develop into a proﬁtable business
model. Although the ﬁrst implementations should be considered extended trials on the
spectrum between public prototypes and actual commercial deployment, these cases
represent the most concrete step to date towards the implementation of vehicles with
higher-order automation. The two other scenarios (evolutionary and revolutionary) may
well learn from these experiences.
Due to the generally rather favorable conditions, it is anticipated that various individual
city governments and operators of amusement parks, shopping malls, and other large-scale
facilities will introduce automated transportation systems in the short term. On that basis,
it also seems very likely that as the list of successful role models lengthens, by the end of
this decade the ﬁeld will already have a broad range of experiences to draw on and
automated vehicles will have won the acceptance of their users and other people on the
road. Despite the inherent simpliﬁcations—in view of the limited geographical range and
low travel speeds—the evolutionary deployment scenario can also extract lessons from it
to apply to the use of automated vehicles on public streets and highways. Even the limited
use case of high or full automation with AMODs will furnish signiﬁcant insight into the
interaction between automated vehicles and other road users (including conventional
vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists) as well as the necessary safety/security measures and
infrastructure requirements for later deployment on public roads. It is likewise fair to
assume that the initially limited ranges of AMODs will expand over time. Accordingly, an
automated transportation arrangement will gradually spread out onto public roads where it
will interact with conventional and/or automated private vehicles.
10.4
Comparison of Scenarios
Now that the previous section has presented the deployment scenarios individually, the
following section will compare them on several levels. As demonstrated above, these
scenarios have both differing and shared objectives in terms of the advantages for users,
commercial operators, and road trafﬁc at large. The section below will spotlight differ-
ences in more detail but also draw attention to commonalities.
10.4.1 Systemic Comparison
The systemic comparison of the three deployment scenarios summarized in Table 10.1
provides an overview of the use cases for driving with higher-order automation,
200
S. Beiker
comparing and contrasting each scenario’s objectives, potential implementations, and
business models.
As described at the beginning, all three scenarios share the objective of raising the
safety and efﬁciency of road trafﬁc as well as increasing mobility and convenience.
Beyond that, they exhibit increasing specialization in terms of the intended usage of a
vehicle or assistance system. For example, when it comes to private cars, driving with
higher-order automation will initially only be offered for highways or parking, in other
words, speciﬁc driving situations. Likewise, new transportation arrangements will only be
deployed at ﬁrst in restricted areas such as shopping malls or amusement parks, in other
words speciﬁc geographical ranges. This would result in a more distinct specialization of
driving or system features than is currently the case. Today, private vehicles are expected
to be usable by “anyone, anywhere, anytime.” In other words, as long as they have a
driver’s license, anyone can drive a car no matter the time or place. With the advent of
driving with higher-order automation, users may face a scenario in which the use of a
vehicle is more limited or case-speciﬁc, requiring a mental adjustment.
These limitations are highlighted in Fig. 10.2, which contrasts the degree of automation
with the geographical range. These two factors are perhaps the most crucial characteristics
for classifying automated driving and allow us to draw an effective comparison between

Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
201
the three deployment scenarios presented here. The evolutionary scenario, entailing
ongoing advancements to driver assistance systems, is intended for an unrestricted geo-
graphical range such as “all highways” or “any parking space.” On the other hand, it only
offers a comparably low level of automation to start out with. By contrast, the revolu-
tionary scenario, which aims at redesigning personal mobility entirely, and the transfor-
mative scenario, which provides for the merging of personal mobility and public
transportation, both imply a very high degree of automation. Both cases would con-
ceivably involve the rapid development of fully automated technology, albeit within a
limited geographical range such as a particular neighborhood, a shopping mall, or an
amusement park. For the sake of simplicity, one might say that the evolutionary scenario
is moving toward the goal of full automation with the strategy of an “unrestricted geo-
graphical range but limited automation,” whereas the revolutionary and transformative
scenarios are pursuing the approach of a “restricted geographical range but unlimited
automation.”
One particularly interesting aspect illustrated by the comparison in Fig. 10.2 is the fact
that the revolutionary scenario does not especially stand out on either axis compared to the
evolutionary and transformative scenarios, yet overall it is the scenario that most closely
approaches the ideal of a fully automated vehicle with unrestricted usage. Thus this
scenario seems most consistent with the paradigm of “anyone, anytime, anywhere,” as it
combines a comparatively large geographical range with comparatively high automation.
In regard to the transformative scenario, the question of who would operate the
vehicles deserves special attention. It is anticipated that trained, specialized personal
would monitor the vehicles’ operation or at least inspect them on a regular, perhaps daily,
basis. As such, that scenario is highly distinct from the model of a privately operated car,
which is generally operated by laypeople and rarely requires the attention of specialized
personnel except for occasional maintenance or servicing. For that reason, the “anyone,
anytime, anywhere” model poses a particular challenge for the evolutionary scenario,
because it would require extremely high dependability even without ongoing supervision
by specialists. Notwithstanding, the revolutionary and transformative scenarios prove to
be helpful in preparation for the advent of individually used private cars with higher-order
automation, since the operation of such vehicles under specialists’ supervision would lead
to useful insight early on.
One potential use case for vehicles with higher-order automation, which is quite sig-
niﬁcant but cannot be directly attributed to one of the three development scenarios, is the
prospect of an automated platoon on highways. In this use case, a number of vehicles that
are otherwise used individually join together into a virtual train by means of a common
communication infrastructure. This allows longitudinal and lateral control to be auto-
mated, although it would also require a special communication standard and only vehicles
compatible with it could be included. At least at the beginning, the ﬁrst vehicle in such a
platoon would be driven by a professional driver; all the vehicles following it would not
require any ongoing supervision and the drivers would only need to intervene in excep-
tional cases [44].
202
S. Beiker
The scenario of an automated vehicle platoon brings together various traits of the
evolutionary and transformative scenarios that make an implementation of such a scheme
within general road trafﬁc seem likewise realistic for the near future. On the one hand, this
scheme would pose a near-term opportunity for an implementation of vehicles with
higher-order automation, as the potentially limited object and situation recognition
capabilities could be augmented by the lead driver’s performance and experience. On the
other hand, it may pose additional issues, such as the logistics of how to join and leaving
the platoon, passing by other vehicles, and adhere to the legal following distance.
10.4.2 Technical Comparison
The systemic comparison has already revealed several differences among the deployment
scenarios, which also have divergent requirements for reliability or, more precisely, the
completeness and availability of the technology needed. Since the evolutionary scenario
focusing on individually used private cars must function for any layperson without
temporal or geographical limitations, it gives rise to different technical requirements from
those of the transformative scenario, for instance, where a fully automated vehicle might
be operated exclusively in a geographically limited zone under professional supervision.
Furthermore, the number of vehicles in question and the corresponding number of system
components may vary greatly, which bears an impact on the technology to be deployed.
To generalize, the evolutionary scenario requires sensor and processor components that
are highly failsafe (i.e. redundant and equipped with fallback systems), low-maintenance
(i.e. self-calibrating and self-monitoring), and cost-efﬁcient (i.e. mass-produced) in order
to guarantee maximum availability (see Table 10.2). The transformative scenario, how-
ever, favors specialized, highly accurate, and individually conﬁgurable systems that
enable maximum automation despite an early implementation deadline, even if that means
more work preparing the infrastructure. What makes the infrastructure for the transfor-
mative scenario especially labor-intensive are its need for a communication system that

Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation

allows the safe and coordinated operation of fully automated vehicles as well as the need
for a maintenance and supervision crew to ensure the vehicles’ functional safety by
servicing them regularly as needed.
The requirements for the revolutionary scenario, in which automated vehicles are
deployed within functional and geographical limitations, lie somewhere in between the
technical requirements of the evolutionary and transformative scenarios, as it implies the
use of a centrally operated and professionally maintained ﬂeet of vehicles that is not
necessarily subject to ongoing supervision. Thus it requires highly failsafe and precise
systems that would presumably lead to comparatively high cost.
The implementation of a communication infrastructure for vehicles with higher-order
automation is especially signiﬁcant for the deployment scenarios. Communication both
among vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure could be employed to exchange
data on vehicle positions, vehicle speeds, and other parameters, which would then be used
for routing or perhaps for a central vehicle coordination system. The trend toward auto-
mated vehicles in the industry would therefore beneﬁt from another current trend which is
toward connected vehicles. In that context, it is also particularly signiﬁcant that there are
government initiatives in various countries aiming to lend momentum to the development
of vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure communication [45–48].
10.4.3 Regulatory Comparison
The three scenarios can also be differentiated by the regulation that would apply to them.
Since the vehicles under the evolutionary scenario are intended to be operated on public
roadways without any geographical or temporal restrictions, their use must be subject to
the corresponding trafﬁc regulations. As a result, it remains unclear at this point which
legal jurisdictions allow automated vehicles to be operated under their purview and to
what extent they may be automated.
In the case of the transformative scenario, however, the circumstances are somewhat
different. Particularly due to the anticipated geographical restrictions of use—initially
outside of public roadways as well as other areas with unrestricted access (instead
favoring locations such as shopping malls or amusement parks with their own access
rules)—a special set of regulations may be implemented. That means that either special
rules will be established for the area where the automated vehicles are operated, access to
it will be restricted to a speciﬁc group of people, or everyone who enters the site will be
required to declare their consent. The ﬁnal arrangement in particular would make oper-
ations considerably easier, as the operator’s liability or mandatory supervision require-
ments could be regulated based on speciﬁc needs.
In terms of legal requirements, the revolutionary scenario falls in between the evolu-
tionary and transformative scenarios. If we assume that such systems are initially limited
to a certain geographical area, such as a neighborhood or a particular highway segment,
204
S. Beiker
the area would be subject to general road trafﬁc regulations but there could conceivably be
special additional rules, such as targeted restrictions, authorizations, or liability regimes
that would apply solely to that route.
In terms of applicable regulation, it is also important to keep in mind how regulators
treat vehicle automation in their own jurisdictions. In the United States, for example, some
states (the pioneers being Nevada, Florida, and California) have instituted regulatory
frameworks governing the operation of vehicles with higher-order automation, albeit in
many cases only for trial runs so far. Meanwhile on the federal level, the National
Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) has urged caution and recommended a
coordinated introduction alongside vehicle-vehicle communication [49]. The government
of Japan has expressed its advocacy of the strategic objective of automating road trafﬁc
and has offered to support the industry to that end [50, 51]. In Europe, governments
remain cautious when it comes to automation—apart from ongoing participation in
research ventures [44, 47, 48, 52–54]—though it is anticipated that the topic will received
intensiﬁed attention in the years from 2015 to 2020, as evident already from the earliest
proposed legislation [55] (Chap. 25).
10.4.4 Comparison of Corporate Strategies
The description of the deployment scenarios above has identiﬁed the lead players and
categories of companies involved in each of the three cases. The evolutionary scenario
appears to be pursued more so by established vehicle manufacturers and system suppliers,
while the revolutionary scenario is favored by non-automotive technology companies
from the IT industry and the transformative scenario is advocated by start-ups and service
providers.
Table 10.3 presents the three categories with the companies’ characteristics, objectives,
and strategies. Thus established automakers can draw on experience and processes
allowing them to implement development projects related to automated driving with
appropriate planning certainty and see them through all the way to the product launch.
This is primarily rooted in the evolutionary approach, where the existing development,
production, and sales processes are extended to a new class of product (automated
driving). That model makes it rather difﬁcult for them to deploy completely novel
products or processes. Another characteristic of the auto industry is that its existing market
positions and company histories lead it to proceed in a manner perceived by outsiders at
times as rather cautious.
The auto industry’s caution might be rooted in the fact that these companies have
established and reﬁned their reputations and brand images among customers over a period
of decades, making their company names valuable assets worth protecting (Chap. 32). The
companies’ reputations can be rapidly jeopardized by unreliable or unsafe products, which
10
Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
205
can have a long-term impact on their commercial success. Along these lines, introducing
automated vehicles prematurely is seen as an especially risky move. Indeed, such reser-
vations are justiﬁable, as evidenced by numerous instances where automotive products
failed to meet customer’s expectations or aroused suspicions of safety risks and con-
sumers proceeded to respond negatively to the associated brands [56–59]. Reservations of
this nature, whether justiﬁed or not, may cause a delay in the market introduction of
automated driving technology, which has strong safety implications and is centrally
important to the public interest.
In contrast, such considerations are much less relevant for start-ups pursuing the
transformative scenario, as these companies tend not to have long histories or an (auto-
motive) brand image to protect. At the same time, they do not have years of experience
developing, producing, and selling cars. This makes these companies better placed to
develop and launch extremely novel products and services as required by the transfor-
mative scenario described above. In the event that a product fails to meet the market’s
expectations, these companies do not bear the risk of jeopardizing a company name that
has been developed over time.
Moreover, start-ups are often able—or practically forced—to develop alternative
processes and product solutions due to their frequently small size. For that reason,
start-ups have more ﬂexibility in the concepts of automated driving that they design and
can pursue implementations with greater inherent risk. Yet the start-ups must also over-
come the challenge that developing automated vehicles is often only feasible by means of
a high capital investment due to the complexity of the systems and components involved.
Likewise, it may take a relatively long time before a product is completed and generates

any revenue. As such, these companies are often reliant on venture capitalists and their
longevity can sometimes be uncertain.
Once again, the revolutionary scenario lies somewhere between the other two. As
explained earlier, the players in this area are often non-automotive technology companies
that have access to sufﬁcient capital and can also capitalize on processes that have not yet
been applied to automotive product development. For those reasons it seems plausible that
a revolutionary scenario can be anticipated from that precise sector. In fact, this type of
company has already begun gathering signiﬁcant experience in transportation systems; for
instance, one of the companies from the IT industry has already traveled over a million
kilometers using vehicles with higher-order automation [22] and has prior involvement
with the transportation of passengers [28] and goods [31].
10.5
Summary and Outlook
This chapter explored three scenarios for the deployment of vehicles with higher-order
automation: the continuous evolution of driver assistance systems by the established auto
industry, the revolution of personal mobility by non-automotive technology companies,
and the transformative merging of private and personal mobility by start-ups and trans-
portation service providers. At this point, these seem to be largely independent devel-
opment paths that occasionally compete. However, in regard to the deployment of driving
with higher-order automation, there are synergies to be exploited, particularly in the areas
of infrastructure and public acceptance. It should also be noted that all three deployment
scenarios ultimately work towards the same ﬁnal scenario, which is for the vehicles that
are currently driven by humans to be fully automated in the future, giving rise to new use
cases and business models and an altered set of transportation behavior.
The differences between the scenarios highlight the likelihood of vehicles with
higher-order automation being introduced in different geographical ranges with varying
sizes and in varying regions. It is also anticipated that the scenarios will be introduced at
different points, resulting in a staggered timeline. To generalize, it is fair to predict that the
sequence of public introductions over the coming decades will lead from the transfor-
mative scenario to the revolutionary scenario and ﬁnally to the evolutionary scenario. The
geographical range of these systems would grow from the local level to the regional scale
and ﬁnally become global.
We can also expect that in addition to the fully automated, slow-traveling and
limited-area transportation options that are currently being introduced in extended trials,
there may be local fully-automated taxi services by the end of the decade, which will lead
the way for the general operation of vehicles with higher-order automation on highways,
country roads, and urban streets in the years after 2020. Over the next few decades, this
development will allow us to exploit many opportunities to increase the safety, efﬁciency,
10
Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
207
convenience, and productivity of personal mobility. Beyond the clear synergies among the
various scenarios, they also offer valuable links to the automation of other vehicle classes
in settings that span from logistics centers and container ports to agriculture and mining,
perhaps even robotic missions to explore far-off planets.

Deployment Scenarios for Vehicles with Higher-Order Automation
211
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
Dirk Heinrichs
11.1
Introduction
Mobility, transport and land use patterns in urban areas are closely bound up with each
other [1]. Urban form plays an important role when households and businesses make
mobility decisions, and to a considerable degree dictates transport mode choice. Compact
city form with high density and mixed use provide good preconditions for short trips and
efﬁcient public transportation, promote walking and cycling, and often render daily car use
unnecessary. With sprawling, sparsely populated land uses, on the other hand, walking
and cycling are discouraged, while car use is favored. In turn, the availability and use of
designated transport modes strongly inﬂuences urban form and the necessary infrastruc-
tures. The residential suburbanization of the latter half of last century was thus to a great
extent encouraged by car availability and the expansion of the transport infrastructure for
motorized passenger transport [2].
It is expected that fully automated driving will entail a completely new transport system,
whichwill notonly bringwith itnewpossibilitiesintrafﬁcmanagement,butwill alsogenerate
completely new types of transport provision that will affect the choice and use of available
transport means (see Chap. 12). The idea, for example, that time in a vehicle does not have to
be spent on driving-related tasks,but instead permitsother activities, mayinstigatea complete
reappraisal of the time factor (e.g. [28]). This ability to attend to other activities in an
autonomous vehicle may imply that long car commutes will be considered less a burden than
today. This could increase the willingness of households to locate further away from the city
center where land prices and rents are lower and where suburban preferences like living in a

greener environment can be better satisﬁed. In other words: autonomous driving can
potentially alter the trade-offs that households make between choosing location and daily
mobility. If we take these connected factors to their logical conclusion, in the end it would be
possible to dissolve the time factor as a limiting variable of urban planning. Will the avail-
ability offully automated vehicles then entirely redeﬁne the interrelationship of mobility and
urban land use? With few exceptions [3], this question remains as yet untackled. Currently,
visions of integrating autonomous vehicles into the urban transport system still essentially
refer to the development of vehicle technology itself and the effects on trafﬁc ﬂow.
In light of this, this article’s aim is to try to gauge potential urban-structure develop-
ments under the inﬂuence of a transport system with autonomous vehicles. Equally, it is to
identify the way in which political and economic frameworks can inﬂuence these
developments. The following questions are considered here:
– What future possibilities are conceivable for a transport system transformed, or
transformable, by automated driving?
– What effects on urban structures—particularly on their density, mix of uses and layout
—might be linked to this in future?
– What inﬂuencing factors are particularly signiﬁcant in developing a transport system
with automated cars in cities?
– What aspects should deﬁnitely be incorporated into the debate on autonomous driving
from the urban planning and development perspective? Also, though: In what way
should the discussion on the development of cities take up the subject of “the
automation of transport”?
As a basis for the examination of these questions, this article will evaluate currently
available scenarios on the city of the future. The following Sect. 11.2 introduces the
scenarios and visions of “the city of tomorrow” available in the literature, and their ideas
regarding the integration of autonomous vehicles into transport systems. It will then
describe what different future possibilities can be conceived for a transport system that is
transformed, or transformable, by automated driving, in which urban structures they can
develop, and which essential inﬂuencing factors are essential for this development.
Building on this, Sect. 11.3 contains a close analysis of the possible “fully automated”
transport system of the future, based on two idealized scenarios developed by the authors.
At the core of these scenarios are (a) autonomous private vehicles, and (b) autonomous
vehicles as an integral part of public transport. Based on a short characterization of both
scenarios, we analyze what the future effects of each scenario on urban structures might be.
Section 11.4 discusses what factors might be especially signiﬁcant in developing a
transport system with automated vehicles in cities. We will identify the driving forces for
the scenarios under examination.
The concluding Sect. 11.5 summarises the essential ﬁndings. It outlines what aspects
deﬁnitely should, from an urban planning and development perspective, be brought to the
debate surrounding automated driving, but also asks how the discourse on urban devel-
opment and planning should embrace autonomous driving.

11.2
Autonomous Driving as a Feature of City-of-Tomorrow
Scenarios
As automated driving in cities has not yet become reality, and the effects on urban
structures are thus not yet observable either, scenarios offer one possibility of drawing on
conceivable future developments and their interrelations. Scenarios describe both a
potential future situation and the development of the path leading from today into the
future [4, 5]. They are a recognized instrument for uncovering and structuring changes,
their drivers and consequences, in a partly unknown, uncertain and rapidly changing
environment [6].
For the following account, a systematic analysis was carried out of the available literature
on the city of the future that deals with the development of mobility and transport. From the
full range of studies, a selection of core documents and scenarios contained therein were
considered for a more detailed analysis. They met the following criteria: a traceable account
of set objectives, their status and a development path; the identiﬁcation of driving forces and
their interdependencies; and a treatment of the topic of mobility and an account of its
interrelationship with settlement structure. Finally, these documents were grouped
according to similarity of type. We then analyzed the forms and signiﬁcance of automated
driving they describe, and the changes that signiﬁcantly impact this trend. The classiﬁcation
proceeded along two axes of uncertainty which are particularly relevant when examining
automated driving: the availability and integration of intelligent communications infras-
tructure (low or high), and the acceptance and use of this infrastructure in general, and for
mobility, by the urban population (characterized as fragmented/low, or high).
The scenarios described in core documents can essentially be classiﬁed into three
types:
– The regenerative/intelligent city
– The hypermobile city
– The endless city
These scenarios will be described more closely below.
11.2.1 The Regenerative and Intelligent City
A series of future studies have highlighted the development of so-called regenerative cities
as a possible development path [7–12]. These studies view technological developments
that use resources in an efﬁcient and environmentally friendly manner as being the heart
and driving force of urban development from 2030 to 2050. At their center is
energy-related building conversion (solarization, energy-plus houses) and the increasing
use of locally generated power from renewable sources, which is distributed and shared
over so-called microgrids or peer-to-peer power systems. This is supported by intelligent
control mechanisms which allow a link-up with other areas of urban functions, such as
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
215
mobility. The signiﬁcance of intelligence and information is highlighted in the corre-
sponding studies. They describe the transformation into a technological regime that is no
longer characterized by technologies for individual sectors (energy, transport, waste etc.)
but rather guarantees a high level of integration between sectors.
This technological development is accompanied by a transformation in the behavior of
the urban population [7]. In general, sustainable consumption is assumed as a very con-
scious and responsible way of dealing with resources [9]. This is explained by the con-
suming urban population having a greater wish for well-being and quality of life in future,
which
are
deﬁned
differently
to
economic
well-being.
Society
will
accept
energy-optimized, and sustainable mobility because the majority of the population not only
has its advantages presented to them in the media, but can also experience them in daily life.
The key to this lies in densely populated metropolitan areas, in which a wide range of
integrated but simple and affordable mobility provision is assured. Cities are characterized
in this scenario as places that, due to their density, allow efﬁcient use of resources. To this
is added the assumption that, with the growing signiﬁcance of cities as economic and
social centers, the potential of taking decisions and action at city level will increase in
future. A number of the studies we analyzed state that cities such as London have already
demonstrated the possibility to transform urban infrastructure, and implement decentral-
ized, innovative approaches to energy and waste, without needing national policy. Cities
transform themselves, driven by competition (between cities), policy and city government,
which actively seek to improve the qualities of the location.
In the course of the resource-efﬁcient transformation of the city, the conditions of
mobility in the regenerative and intelligent city also change. Information and communi-
cation technology is becoming increasingly pervasive in the transport system. The studies
analyzed see in this a basis for expanding demand-oriented mobility-management
approaches, and the linking of transport provision with a ﬂexible, multimodal transport
system in the future (see Chap. 9). Public transportation’s role as the backbone of urban
mobility is being further expanded and continually modernized, for example in integrated
planning, with walking and cycling as part of ecomobility, whose share of road space is
increasing. Supplementing this, citizens also have individual transport modes at their
disposal (bicycles, e-bikes, electric cars and transporters), indeed precisely when and
where needed by an individual (“mobility on demand”). This “sharing” provision, fol-
lowing the principle of “using not owning,” is being introduced and extended by various
providers and helps to greatly reduce the amount of public space currently taken up by
private cars. A personal, mobile and electronic mobility assistant allows all the available
means of dealing with daily mobility to be weighed up, and situation-speciﬁc optimal
variants to be selected.
One topic of the studies is the further development of electronic assistance systems for
cars, in conjunction with the development of new, more efﬁcient drive types. It is assumed
that privately owned cars will also continue to have some signiﬁcance in future [11].
Various studies expect vehicles, with electronic assistance systems for semi-autonomous
216
D. Heinrichs
use ﬁtted as standard, to be present in the period 2030–2050. On freeways with high
transit volumes or on commuter routes, for example, they allow driving on autopilot,
which optimizes the trafﬁc ﬂow. This is assured through high-level interconnectedness
and communication between vehicle and the transport infrastructure. This development
will be enabled by new legislation regarding licensing, insurance and liability, as well as a
range of acceptance-generating concepts from the state concerning data management and
standardization (open source, interface compatibility, data protection and security).
As part of the changes in mobility provision, the studies we analyzed also describe a
transformation in cities’ urban spatial structure. The interlinking of transport provision,
according to these authors, increases the formation of so-called mobility hubs, which can
already be seen today. It is assumed that city districts will be organized around these hubs
in a polycentric urban structure in future. Land consumption for parking spaces in urban
areas will have clearly fallen. The reasons for this are a dynamic distribution of vehicles in
city districts, and automated, space-saving “parking racks.”
11.2.2 The Hypermobile City
The hypermobile city, as a potential development path, is a particular focus in a study by
the Foresight Directorate of the UK Ofﬁce of Science and Technology [7]. It outlines the
development of a society, up to 2055, in which uninterrupted information, consumption
and competition are the norm [7].
This scenario, like that of the regenerative city, also assumes that any remaining
barriers to the majority of society using individual transport will be overcome, but with
continued very high demand on resources and the corresponding environmental conse-
quences. One essential element and driver of this growth is acceptance of the development
of electronic and digital infrastructure. This could involve using cameras for virtual
exchange, for example, or personal information assistants. If acceptance is currently still
low, it will markedly increase in coming years due to its commercial and lifestyle
advantages. People in the city of the future will be “always on,” whether at home or work.
To manage this, they will use personalized assistants equipped with encryption technology
to help them in extensive organizing and daily planning. Even if the problems and
reservations regarding data protection and privacy are clearly highlighted issues in this
scenario, in the end they will be put to one side due to the beneﬁts electronic assistants
bring to users.
Between now and 2055, the state and private sector will have cooperated on devel-
oping the required technologies. Key interventions include strong support of user-related
information and communications technology (personal assistant systems, standardization
of communication standards, and GPS) and technological development (encryption
technology, sensors, position ﬁnding). One important prerequisite on the way is putting
great effort into data security at the European level.
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
217
Mobility in this scenario’s target year is described as markedly networked. The authors
outline a development in which mobility demand continues to rise. The strong emphasis
on information and communication technology in this scenario will also further mobility’s
automation, not least in optimizing trafﬁc ﬂows and reducing jams. In cities, mass taxi
systems will to a great extent replace standard public transportation. These will take over
the job of efﬁciently carrying and picking up passengers in boarding zones. The vehicles
used locally for this will operate in assigned districts, and users will call them up using
their personal assistants. The network will compute the most efﬁcient route, including
picking up and dropping off other passengers, and calculate the price. This network, also
known as a “swarm,” can process large volumes of data on the trafﬁc situation and
demand locations. The vehicles can adjust their route. Passengers can use any vehicle
instead of having to wait for a certain line.
Autonomous vehicles will travel long-distance on freeways on “guided lanes” that are
specially reserved for autonomous vehicles, some of them also for overnight use. People
will buy larger vehicles and drive longer distances. These vehicles will be equipped with
an “on-board driverless unit,” which communicates with automated systems along free-
ways and essential commuter routes. This produces convoys of automatically controlled
vehicles travelling tightly together at high speed.
The development of urban land use is described differently in this scenario. On the one
hand, there will be highly condensed city centers; on the other, suburbs with lower
densities will grow. While young people in particular will prefer to live in urban centers, a
growing number of high-income households will decide to move to city peripheries or the
country. Despite increasing distances to their jobs in the city center, they will be able to
continue
having
intensive
working
lives,
either
by
aid
of
telepresence—using
ever-more-powerful communication instruments—or the convenient use of automated
vehicles. At the same time, this population group, by living in suburbia, will feel they
have the opportunity to recover from increasingly tiring and demanding working lives in
the hypermobile world.
11.2.3 The Endless City
While the scenarios for regenerative and hypermobile cities highlight technological
development as a motor for changes in city life, mobility and urban structures, this
scenario paints a somewhat different picture [12].
The underlying assumptions here are that technological innovations are not taken up to
any great extent, particularly due to the high cost of the necessary infrastructure. Tech-
nological development does take place, but is mainly restricted to efﬁciency gains in
speciﬁc areas (combustion engines, solar energy). The power of the state to steer devel-
opment is seen as limited. Even a transformation in behavior, as sketched out in the
developments above, will not be seen.
218
D. Heinrichs
With regard to mobility and urban structure, this scenario’s authors envisage a model
still clearly dominated by cars. Due to limitations in how much states can develop public
transport systems, so-called informal paratransit services will continue to grow. The
degree of networking with available provision will remain low. The potential for auton-
omous driving systems is not discussed. Spatially, cities will exhibit low density and
fragmented settlement structures. In this regard, the authors are extrapolating a trend that
is currently observable globally [13].
11.2.4 Discussion
The selection and analysis outlined above shows that, scenarios do partially discuss the
possibility of a transport system that is changed, or capable of being changed, by auto-
mated driving. Automated solutions are formulated in scenarios with a high penetration
and interlinking of innovative communication and navigation technologies in particular
(regenerative and hypermobile cities). Here, automated driving is expected to contribute to
public transportation. The scenarios describe the use of stackable and programmable
compact cars, for example, and a networked mass taxi system. Automated private vehicles
are mentioned in the course of long-distance freeway travel. Table 11.1 summarizes the
main characteristics of the different scenarios with respect to likely forms of autonomous
driving, the implications on urban form and land use, and the main driving factors.
Turning to the effects of automated driving on urban structures, the various scenarios
ﬁrst describe how it is bound up with an overall transformation in the general framework.
The regenerative city scenario assumes an increasing density of population and functions
in cities. Other scenarios (hypermobile and endless cities) presuppose a continuation of
the suburbanization tendencies that can currently be seen around the world. These are
viewed as the consequence of high-income househoulds’ individual preferences, or as
being due to processes of pushing low-income households out of cities. The formation of
so-called mobility hubs or nodes is described in various scenarios as a visible change in
urban form resulting from a transport system with elements of automated driving. In the
regenerative and intelligent city scenario, the idea of networking is rigorously carried over
to urban space. Multi-modal transport hubs allow physical networking and simple
transfers between modes, e.g. from (electric) car to public transport. The scenario goes one
step further, in that it also assumes a change in other uses, stemming from the bundling of
different mobility options. It describes city districts that are organized around mobility
hubs and utilities, and in which automated vehicles are incorporated as part of the public
transport ﬂeet. Parking and its connection to urban space is also discussed in very different
ways in almost all scenarios. The regenerative city scenario describes the drop in land
consumption in conjunction with falling numbers of private cars and local parking-area
management. In the intelligent city of the future, an interlinking of private-car use with
public transport will have been achieved, and new park and ride areas will have emerged
at mobility hubs.

Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
219
The descriptions of intelligent and regenerative cities in particular are thus characterized
by a basic conviction that technology will overcome existing and foreseeable problems
(scarce resources, environmental change). The central signiﬁcance of technological
development is also conﬁrmed in the endless city scenario, but from the opposite point of
view. There, lack of innovation is interpreted as explaining a series of negative develop-
ments. In a certain sense, this scenario depicts possible developments in southern cities of
the globe, where the capacity of the state to direct development is comparatively low.
Only the hypermobile city scenario critically deals with the topic of data. Problems of
data protection and security are taken to be accepted in the target period of 2055, as the
individual beneﬁts of information and communications solutions for participation in social
networks and working life outweigh the disadvantages in the eyes of the population.

11.3
Autonomous Driving and Its Impact on Urban Structure
The scenarios described in the previous section propose answers to the question: In what
form is automated driving conceivably a feature of tomorrow’s cities’ transport systems?
We will now have a closer look at the possible changes in urban form and land use
resulting from this: How will the distribution of uses, density, and layout of urban spaces
change under the inﬂuence of autonomous driving?
The scenarios introduced above demonstrate that fundamentally different options can
be imagined. Firstly, they describe the development of autonomous private vehicles that,
depending on the scenario, are controlled with no external aids by an autopilot system or
are integrated into the trafﬁc ﬂow via vehicle-infrastructure communication. Secondly, the
scenarios envisage autonomous driving as an integrated part of public transport provision.
It can be assumed that the effects on urban form could differ greatly depending on the
form of autonomous transport system. In the following, therefore, both forms are con-
sidered separately.
11.3.1 Autonomous Private Cars
At its core, this form describes the transfer of driving tasks to machines in uni-modal
individual transport. It calls on aspects of the use cases, outlined in Chap. 2, of freeway
pilot, fully automated with extended availability through driver, and valet parking.
This case assumes that future use will largely correspond with today’s car usage. Apart
from the changed properties of the technology used, no changes are expected. Cars will
still be in individual ownership. No assumptions are made concerning changes in modal
and destination choice patterns. There are, however, changes regarding current vehicle
use. First, autonomous driving permits other activities during the trip: Former drivers will,
for example, be able to work on their laptops, eat, read a book, watch a ﬁlm or call friends
[14]. Second, autonomous driving will change access and egress. Today’s cars are either
driven directly from home to the destination, or the user has to walk to the parking
location of the vehicle at the start of the trip and again from the parking to the ﬁnal
destination. One impact of autonomous driving, however, will be that these distances
before and after the main journey will be made by the car, not the driver. The driving
robot will maneuver the car from its original parking space to the location of the
owner/user and, after arriving at the destination, to an allocated parking space.
The possible effects and changes on urban structure from autonomous-vehicle usage
include, ﬁrstly, the parking area needed for vehicles at home and destination. Secondly,
locations would become more attractive for households choosing places to live. There will
also be a transformation in the attractiveness of locations that are destinations for daily
activities, such as shopping and leisure. This is accompanied by changes in the space
required for ﬂowing trafﬁc resulting from autonomous car use. These three aspects will in
the following section be looked at more closely.
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
221
11.3.1.1
Change in the Required Parking Area
Overall, the expected changes in the area required for home parking are small, although
they differ according to type of settlement structure. In residential neighborhoods of
single-family houses, where parking spaces are on the same plot as the home, no changes
are expected. The available parking space will simply be occupied by a different
(autonomous) vehicle. In areas of higher density, such as inner-city districts, it may be
assumed that neighborhood parking zones or collective garages will appear or be
developed, as only in this way will autonomous vehicles be guaranteed to ﬁnd a space in
the neighborhood-deﬁned catchment area.
Further effects of autonomous driving on parking areas are possible at journey desti-
nations away from home. This includes trips made for shopping, leisure and work. An
autonomous vehicle would be able to drop off its passengers at their destination and then
independently park itself in an allocated parking space or a collective garage. It is also
assumed here that sufﬁcient parking capacity will be provided to allow vehicles to ﬁnd a
space safely and reliably. On the one hand, this use of autonomous driving, where the
vehicle drops the user off at the destination and proceeds to park autonomously, may be
accompanied by greater user willingness to visit certain destinations by car. Equally, there
may be a substantial impact on the provision and management of parking areas. Partic-
ularly in areas of high-usage density, it may be assumed that a bundling of parking
provision, in the form of collective garages, will follow.
The possibility of saving space is named as an essential argument for the use of
automated parking systems. These should be made more space-efﬁcient, primarily by
replacing ramps and aisles with lift shafts, and lowering storey heights, but also by
increasing parking density [14, 15]. The developers reckon on up to 60 % more parking
spaces on the same area by using parking robots [16].
The efﬁcient use of space for parking is especially attractive in terms of costs [16–18].
Parking spaces required for building developments consume a lot of space and represent a
considerable share of the costs of the whole investment, particularly when the garage to be
built is not at ground level. There have already been some projects testing parking in
garages with autonomous vehicles [19, 20]. The driver hands the vehicle over at the
garage entrance. The parking function is activated with a smartphone app. The car
receives the route data to the nearest available space from a central garage computer via
WLAN and drives to it autonomously. An automatic parking system already in existence
may serve as an example. All necessary vehicle movements, except for entry and exit into
a handover booth, are carried out automatically (via conveyors and shifting equipment) or
with a specially developed parking robot, as is already in use [16].
As mentioned above, the restructuring and possible concentration of parking areas
might not take place everywhere. It will primarily be restricted to areas which are espe-
cially attractive destinations, and where costs for building the required parking lots, and
therefore also the attractiveness of space-saving solutions, are particularly high (the high
price and scarcity of land resulting in multi-level solutions). High-density city center
service and shopping zones count among these areas, as do new business districts with a
222
D. Heinrichs
high number of workers. To this may be added mobility hubs such as airports and railroad
stations, where, on top of the criteria just given, safe and secure solutions for long-term
parking are sought. The extent to which the costs of parking might change in the course of
autonomous driving cannot be estimated. On the one hand, dropping off passengers at the
destination and subsequently parking elsewhere in the city (with less pressure on use and
therefore cheaper) may save money [21, 22]. On the other hand, retroﬁtting and
restructuring parking facilities and infrastructure brings with it its own costs.
11.3.1.2
Change in the Attractiveness of (Residential) Locations
Some studies point to an increasing attractiveness of suburban residential districts when
autonomous driving becomes available [2, 22, 23]. According to this argument, house-
holds using an autonomous vehicle may choose to live in green areas with lower house
prices, but further from the city center, as the autonomous vehicle will compensate for the
location’s downsides (longer distances). One consequence may be that new residential
areas of relatively low density spring up, similar to the development of suburbanization in
the second half of the last century. That was strongly driven by motorization, infras-
tructure, a planning policy approach of separated uses and dispersed cities, and house-
holds deciding to settle in the countryside. The results are still to be seen in today’s land
use patterns [24].
In general, it is known that working people’s choice of where to live is far more
inﬂuenced by factors such as quality of life and living environment than the wish to be
near to their place of work [25]. This is backed up by a relatively high prominence of
commuting to work. Some 60 % of all employees subject to social insurance in Germany,
that is around 17 million people, do not work in the municipality in which they live. In
order to get to work, working people spend on average around half an hour each way. Car
use dominates here, being used to make 66 % of trips [26], in the USA as many as 86 %
[27]. Based on datasets covering employment and occupation, as well working across
regional borders, Guth et al. [25] discovered that the proportion of commuting beyond the
home municipality, and distances covered, have grown in German areas of agglomeration
in the last decades.
Autonomous driving could further encourage this trend and the willingness to accept
longer commutes. First, it is assumed that an increase in travel comfort will accompany
autonomous driving (e.g. [14]). The travel time will no longer have to be taken up paying
attention to the onerous task of driving, but will instead permit other activities. Mobility
will not necessarily be seen as an unpleasant obligation or loss of time. Moreover, travel
times may get shorter. In connection with autonomous driving, there are high expectations
for a generally more efﬁcient handling of ﬂowing and stationary trafﬁc [2, 22, 28].
Autonomous vehicle can harmonise their driving with each other, for instance when
accelerating or braking, thus reducing journey times. Close to zero waiting at junctions is
also forecast [14]. Clear time gains will also come when looking for parking spaces, as
passengers are set down ﬁrst. Overall, a journey with an autonomous vehicle will be easier
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
223
to predict and plan and be more reliable in terms of time. This is the result of almost
constant speeds and a reliable and predictable routing from starting point to destination.
Improved travel comfort and shorter and more reliable travel times are relevant factors
for households weighing up further-away jobs, or other objectives such as good schools,
against other location criteria such as local house prices or the attractiveness of a country
location. The basis for decision-making could change, especially for working commuters
with an autonomous vehicle. Journey times are a particularly large additional burden for
commuters [29]. This is further exacerbated where it becomes impossible to calculate
durations, and thus the time of arrival at the destination. Psychological studies for Greater
London [30] show that time losses that the transport user cannot control—in trafﬁc jams,
for instance—are responsible for stress to a particularly large degree.
11.3.1.3
Space Requirements for Flowing Traffic
The beneﬁts of autonomous driving mentioned above also lead to expectations that
capacity on transport routes will be freed up. Coordinated acceleration and braking, and
the higher vehicle frequency (the so-called “platooning”) will make possible a reduction
of the street area used for trafﬁc [30]. A substantially higher vehicle density in relation to
road area is to be expected [30, 31], although forecasts for the extent of this increase in
capacity differ. Fernandez [31], for instance, assumes up to 500 %. Brownell estimates
over 250 % for highways and some 180 % for inner-city streets [32]. This means that the
area required for ﬂowing trafﬁc could be reduced, by reducing the number of trafﬁc lanes,
for example. Lane width could also be cut in comparison to the present size, due to the
altered driving behavior of autonomous vehicles (see Chap. 16). The reduction in the
space needed for ﬂowing trafﬁc could allow other uses to be encouraged, such as cycle
lanes and footpaths. Various authors, however, indicate that such effects only come into
play with full automation [22].
Higher density of ﬂowing trafﬁc could also have an impact on transport users such as
pedestrians and cyclists in other ways. Segregation effects may increase, for example, and
crossing the street with densely ﬂowing trafﬁc may be made more difﬁcult. In order to
guarantee the beneﬁts of autonomous driving for trafﬁc ﬂow while simultaneously
maintaining
its
“permeability”
for
pedestrians
and
cyclists,
the
installation
of
intersection-free crossings such as under and overpasses would be a necessary
consequence.
11.3.2 Autonomous Taxis as an Integrated Part of Public Transport
A second development, far more prominently discussed in the scenarios in question, is the
emergence of a new model of urban mobility, in the form of autonomous taxi ﬂeets. This
touches on aspects of the “Vehicle on Demand” use case as described in Chap. 2. In such
a system, low-cost autonomous taxis do not operate on ﬁxed routes following rigid
timetables, but rather in a demand-oriented and ﬂexible way. They are in permanent
224
D. Heinrichs
operation and run in a city-wide, dense network of stations. This mode of operation is
similar to hailed shared taxis. The city is divided into cells. A “central transit point,” or
a series of them, for pick up and drop off belongs to each of these cells. It should be
possible to integrate and combine taxis with rail-bound public transport. The taxis will
take over feeder and dispersion functions to and from rail-based public transport stations
and pick up passengers there, while the more efﬁcient and potentially faster public
transport takes over for longer route sections. The use of an automated taxi network has
already been described and modeled as a concept [32–34]. It could lead to a fundamental
transformation of public transportation and solve the problem that high-speed rail has
covering the last mile [23]. It involves abolishing standard bus and tram stops. It is
important that the system is an integrated one. It is an open question whether taxis will be
operated by the public or private sector.
11.3.2.1
Public Space Used for Transport and Parking
The effects of a public transport system with autonomous vehicles on urban land use could
be very extensive. The use of autonomous vehicles could cut down the number of parking
spaces in city centers considerably, as the vehicle would not have to navigate to a parking
station some distance away, but would simply drive to the next passenger. Vehicles would
thus be in continuous service. Demand for parking spaces would fall. It would, though, be
necessary to set up local depots for the cleaning, maintenance, refueling/charging and
repairs of vehicles in service.
Permanently available deployment of such taxi ﬂeets may strengthen carsharing, and
possibly dynamic “ridesharing” as well, as it allows the spontaneous renting of a vehicle,
calculated to precise minutes and distances, for door-to-door journeys [14]. It could be
viewed as a logical extension of currently available ﬂexible car-sharing business models,
which already have these properties (Car2Go, City Car Club, DriveNow, Zipcar). In this
light, it may be assumed that such a system would noticeably alter vehicle ownership and
usage (see Chap. 9). An increased degree of occupancy in car usage is also possible [22].
One consequence that may be assumed is a drop in car ownership among households
living in areas with such a mobility-on-demand service in operation. Americans, for
instance, could currently imagine getting rid of their second car, given the availability of
such a system with direct pick-up from the front door [28]. The change in car ownership
would lead to a change in the parking space needed for stationary trafﬁc. This may go as
far as stationary trafﬁc largely disappearing in favor of areas for multi-functional trips.
These areas could be wider than before and be divided into lanes for bicycles and elec-
trically aided micro-vehicles with speeds of up to around 30 km/h, with a further lane for
heavier and faster vehicles.
A further change in the use of urban space is the establishment of pick-up and drop-off
stations, which will further enhance the character of mobility hubs, especially those with
transfer points to other forms of public transport. Beyond the reshaping of these spaces
(stopping/short-term parking, picking up of passengers), changes in usage can also be
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
225
expected, such as a greater concentration of “traditional” shopping and service facilities at
the hubs.
Through the extensive reshaping of the public transport system, an impact on the
complementary public transport infrastructure and uses is also possible. If users convert
from using private cars to autonomous taxis linked up to an efﬁcient rail-based network,
forming the “backbone” of the system, passenger numbers would increase on these routes
and, in all probability, capacities would have to be adjusted.
11.4
Essential Driving Forces for the Development of an Urban
Transport System with Automated Vehicles
The previous Sects. 11.2 and 11.3 analyzed the scenarios in question and, based on the
different characteristics, discussed the impact of a transport system inﬂuenced by auton-
omous driving on urban land use. Following this up, this section asks which factors could
have the greatest impact on the development of this type of system.
The discussion of the scenarios ﬁrstly shows the great importance of technological
innovation, where autonomous driving obtains an increasing role in the transport system.
Progress and new developments in the area of information and communication technol-
ogy, electronic and digital infrastructure, data management, and artiﬁcial intelligence are
essential drivers of this trend, whereby a transport mode’s automation can be viewed as
part of a more extensive automation of urban processes in general. The automation of
parking, or of energy and facility management, are examples of this.
As a result, we can see the high expectations for the state’s capacity to control events
that are bound up with the development of transport systems involving automated vehicles.
The scenarios expect that the state will cooperate with the private sector in developing the
necessary technologies. This is accompanied by new legislation on licensing, insurance and
liability, and acceptance-creating concepts on the topics of data management and stan-
dardization (open source, interface compatibility, data protection and security).
With regard to the population’s acceptance of autonomous driving, it is clear that a
series of possible factors could have a positive impact. Firstly, automated driving is
combined with societal use of an efﬁcient and environmentally friendly transport system.
Secondly, it is quite possible that private users’ and economic players’ acceptance will rise
in coming years, due to individual lifestyle and economic beneﬁts, particularly when
governments actively promote technology and acceptance.
A further factor that automation may positively impact is the prospect of cost-effective
use and an upgrading of urban land use. One example is parking, for which automation
promises clear cost-savings for the building of parking areas and, due to reduced space
requirements, potential conversion to high-value usage. But areas on the edge of the city
or in the surrounding area might also proﬁt in the course of a potential revaluation of
location-choice criteria, and from increased attractiveness as a place to live.
226
D. Heinrichs
It must, however, be borne in mind that there is much uncertainty concerning the
factors mentioned here. Firstly, given the fundamental legal and ethical questions (see
Chaps. 4 and 25), it is not at all possible to predict at what speed, and in what form, urban
transport systems involving autonomous vehicles will be developed.
It is also currently not possible to reliably forecast the consequences for transport, and
thus also urban land use. By integrating autonomous driving into a collective public
transport system, carsharing may develop more strongly, and car ownership may fall. An
increased acceptance and use of “one’s own” car could strengthen the prospects of
individual motorized transport. The latter case, in particular, raises the question of possible
“rebound effects.” Time savings and low usage costs may lead to higher mobility rates and
increased kilometers traveled [22]. Under these circumstances, an increase in autonomous
vehicles would compensate initial efﬁciency gains in the use of road capacity.
However, the question of how the amount of additional costs of autonomous-vehicle
use might evolve currently remains unanswered. The scenarios analyzed in this chapter
are not plausible on this point, arguing solely on the assumption that mobility will con-
tinue to be affordable in future. Calculations of the additional costs to equip cars, however,
assume that both purchase and running costs will initially increase markedly [22, 28]. To
these can be added resulting costs for municipalities for transport infrastructure adjustment
and the building of new neighborhoods, should the attractiveness of suburbs actually
increase.
Out of all these aspects follows much uncertainty in planning for local and regional
stakeholders—the politicians, administrations, transport operators and the real estate sec-
tor. In particular, the adjustment of transport infrastructure and settlement development
demands a long-term approach, including the corresponding regulation and ﬁnancing.
Changes in urban land use in the course of autonomous driving are thus only to be expected
when most vehicles on the street are automated. So long as this is not the case, trafﬁc
density might well continue to increase signiﬁcantly, journeys remain difﬁcult to plan,
parking demand stay high and street widths remain unaffected. Stakeholders, at least those
from local trafﬁc and urban planning departments, are thus currently still lacking important
orientation for taking action and decisions. Not least among this is the lack of clarity as to
what form autonomous driving will actually take in the medium and long term.
11.5
Summary and Outlook
The core aim of this article has been to fathom potential implications on urban form and
land use of a transport system with autonomous vehicles, and to assess the way in which
political and economic conditions might impact this development. Based on available
scenarios and visions of “the city of tomorrow,” and their ideas regarding integrating
autonomous vehicles into transport systems, we have seen that different developments can
be envisaged. For example, is the autonomous vehicle in the scenario a private one driven
11
Autonomous Driving and Urban Land Use
227
by
an
autopilot,
unaided
by
any
external
system,
or
is
it
networked
via
vehicle-infrastructure communication? Or is it an integrated part of public transportation?
Depending on these varying characteristics, autonomous transport modes have the
potential to change the transport system in utterly different ways. Their properties and
potential uses will also affect land-use and urban planning. Areas of inﬂuence include
parking demand and organization, and the attractiveness of neighborhoods as places to
live, shop or work. Moreover, autonomous vehicles may allow land currently used for
transport and parking to be converted to other uses (either for other transport uses, such as
walking or cycling, but also for construction purposes). The changes that might actually
follow depend largely on the direction in which autonomous driving evolves.
What aspects are essential to include in discussions on automated driving from an
urban development and planning point of view?
Firstly, it is clear that autonomous driving may have a series of possible effects on
urban land use that are relevant, in turn, as decision-making criteria for owning and using
autonomous vehicles. The possibility of households achieving their “suburban” prefer-
ences more easily is one example of this. Connections in decision-making processes
between long-term mobility (location choice) and daily mobility (destination and transport
mode selection) should be brought into debates surrounding autonomous driving. As well
as such individual-centered criteria, there are relevant issues in relation to autonomous
driving’s societal use. These involve, for example, the follow-up costs of developing new
suburban neighborhoods as a result of changes in such areas’ attractiveness. The extent to
which such correlations actually materialize as autonomous driving is introduced, and
how the consequences are to be assessed, should be understood and discussed in relation
to autonomous driving as a matter of priority.
Secondly, there is the ﬁnding that, alongside potential changes in land use, far-reaching
transformation—right down to new infrastructure and the reconﬁguring of transport
spaces including those for parking—may arise in the course of modifying the transport
system. Developments in the driving patterns and handling of autonomous and
non-autonomous vehicles, and also in other modes, must take this into account. That is
altogether a long-term task, as changes in urban land use in the course of autonomous
driving can only be expected when most vehicles on the street are automated [22]. Many
of these questions need further investigation. There is, for instance, a need to analyze what
impact autonomous driving might have on long-term plans for designing parking spaces,
cycle lanes, junctions, sidewalks, cross-sectional road proﬁles etc of urban spaces. How
can a successive transformation towards a transport system with autonomous vehicles be
designed? What are plausible scenarios for its introduction in the ﬁrst place? Requiring
clariﬁcation here is not merely how the present infrastructure can be “converted,” but also
how the current prioritization and roles of various modes and transport means will change
in the process. With the increase in autonomous vehicles and the emergence of special
trafﬁc lanes described above, there may be greater separation of functions between various
modes. It may also become more difﬁcult for other transport users to cross the street as a
result of autonomous vehicles’ dense trafﬁc ﬂow. This raises the question of on how much
228
D. Heinrichs
of an equal footing, the mix of the various transport-mode uses should be managed in
future, as the impact of autonomous driving makes itself felt.
It is becoming clear that not only are urban development issues relevant to the debates
on autonomous driving, but the reverse is also the case. Of great consequence is the
impact that an automated transport system has on the concepts and objectives of urban
planning and development. To what extent and under which conditions can a transport
system with autonomous vehicles contribute to realizing currently valid models, such as
dense and compact cities? Or will automation promote a return to cities built around the
automobile? What is the relationship between urban-planning elements for structuring
autonomous transport and the demands of the universally aspired-to city of pedestrians,
cycling and rail? Could it be, under the impact of autonomous driving, that we need to
formulate fundamentally different or new models for the development of cities? We can
now start the discussion of these questions.

Automated Vehicles and Automated
Driving from a Demand Modeling
Perspective
Rita Cyganski
12.1
Motivation and Aims
In 2013 Willumsen, one of the most renowned researchers in transport modeling, stated,
regarding automated vehicles: “We can no longer ignore them, if [the] planning horizon is
10+ years” [37]. But works attempting to anticipate the effects of automated vehicles on
potential users’ everyday mobility, and speciﬁcally their choice of transport mode, are still
rare (e.g. [11, 19, 37]). However, a glance at the individual driving forces of our daily
mobility behavior does allow us to draw some cautious conclusions on potential behav-
ioral changes arising from the introduction of automated vehicles. Applying analogies to
the use of known transport modes in transport demand modeling allows for initial
quantitative statements about potential impacts on overall transport demand. In the pro-
cess, demand modeling allows us to distinguish between different geographic contexts and
user groups, and to evaluate various scenarios for the use of such systems.
The aim of this chapter is to sketch out challenges and initial approaches on how to
incorporate automated vehicles among the choices of transport mode when modeling
demand in passenger transport. First, we will examine which factors play a central role in
the individual processes when weighing up the various transport modes. The following
section gives a short introduction into transport demand modeling’s manner of operation.
We shall then turn our attention to what behavioral changes may appear in transport modal
choice as a result of introducing automated vehicles. We will discuss what properties of
the new vehicles, and also of the geographic context and potential users themselves, could
be signiﬁcant in how the vehicles are perceived and received, and what competitive
situation between transport modes this will result in. To support this work, we shall

introduce the initial results of an online questionnaire on attitudes to automated vehicles
and their anticipated use. The concluding section addresses the following questions: What
are the challenges when integrating automated vehicles into model-supported transport
demand analysis? How do current models and data bases need to be expanded to give an
adequate mapping?
12.2
What Determines Which Transport Mode We Choose?
The question as to why we decide in favor of a certain mode of transport occupies a
multitude of publications from various disciplines. There is consensus that a vast number
of complex interdependent factors underlie human transport behavior and mode choice.
According to Bühler (2001), these subdivide into four groups: (1) socio-economic and
demographic
characteristics,
(2)
cultural
frameworks
and
individual
preferences,
(3) spatial development patterns and (4) political regulation [6]. Alongside personal
criteria, Ortùzar and Willumsen [24] see the characteristics of the intended journey and,
not least, of the transport supply and of the modes available as being most decisive.
Of special signiﬁcance in mode choice is the question of access to alternative modes of
transport. Driver’s license ownership, individual income situation and closely related car
ownership are important behavioral determinants. Substantial investments such as
purchasing a car or a season ticket for public transportation have a long-term impact on
transport mode choice [31]. Clear differences in modal choice can be seen in terms of sex,
employment status, and household size and structure. Further, the presence of children in a
household has a particular inﬂuence [6, 24, 28]. But it is not only objectively measurable
criteria that play a role. Individual personal circumstances, lifestyles, and attitudes towards
the various transport modes and traveling itself affect the decision, as do daily habits and
routines (see [25, 27, 29, 33]). The effect of transport socialization and social and envi-
ronmental norms is stressed in the approaches of learning theory and cognitive and social
psychology (see [2, 12, 27]). These show clearly that individual decisions often do not
correspond to the idealized picture of an independently and rationally deciding human being.
Residential location is considered to be the main spatial anchoring point for individual
transport related decisions. Its physical structures directly affect the accessibility of des-
tinations looked at visiting and the effort it takes to get to them ([6, 9, 27], Chap. 20). For
instance, higher population density, greater mix of uses, and proximity of public trans-
portation are associated with lifestyles with lower car use and higher rates of walking and
cycling. At the same time, trafﬁc jams, shortage of parking space, and higher parking costs
are more common in densely populated areas [6].
If nothing else, the ﬁnancial cost of using a transport mode is a direct or indirect
consequence of political regulation. Operating costs, road tolls, and parking costs inﬂu-
ence how people view their cars. Travel time, particularly in comparison to the time
needed for the alternative transport modes available, is another important selection cri-
terion. In this context, it should be distinguished between time spent on pre- and
234
R. Cyganski
post-usage, e.g. the way to and from bus stops, and time actually spent travelling on the
bus. In the case of public transport, moreover, it can be shown that waiting and transfer
times, and the number of transfers, have a considerable impact on how the mode is
evaluated Wardman [36]. However, it is not only instrumental factors that play a
signiﬁcant role, but also the associated symbolic and affective ones [33]. For instance, a
transport mode’s alleged or actual reliability and punctuality affect the decision for or
against a speciﬁc transport mode, as do its associated safety, convenience, pleasure, and
ﬂexibility [4, 24, 33].
Selecting a transport mode, furthermore, also depends on the purpose of the journey.
Here, not only the individual trip but the whole trip chain, i.e. all journeys undertaken
between leaving the home and returning to it, should be considered [4]. The number and
type of accompanying persons can also be decisive in selecting a means of transport, as
can transportation needs or the distance to be covered [16, 25, 33].
12.3
Transport Mode Choice in Applied Transport Models
12.3.1 A Short Introduction to Transport Demand Modeling
Transport demand models are important and established tools in transport-related planning
and decision-making processes. They allow for analysis of the present transport situation,
forecasting of future developments in transport demand, or the examination of various
potential development paths based on scenarios. The basis of a transport demand model is
the simpliﬁed, purpose-speciﬁc representation of interdependencies between mobility
demand and its concrete geographic manifestation. Transport models are mathematical
models that place high demands on the extent and depth of detail of the input data, and
which, particularly in relation to human decision-making processes and present transport
demand, rely on extensive empirical data.
The aim of passenger transport modeling is to represent all decisions of individuals
made as a consequence of a planned change of location. The ﬁrst model stage, trip
generation, addresses the question of how many changes of location are made in the study
area. To this end, the number of trips or activities that can be expected for the population
according to statistics within one day is determined. In the process, the generated trips or
trip chains are differentiated according to trip purpose. In the next step—destination
choice or trip distribution—a destination is selected for each trip depending on its pur-
pose. Given the combination of origin and destination, the third model step—transport
mode choice or transport allocation—weighs up the various available transport modes
and selects one of them. The next step—trafﬁc assignment or route choice—determines
the route taken from origin to destination and sometimes speciﬁes the starting time in
more detail. The basis here is the so-called supply model, in which the transport system
for all available transport modes is mapped in such detail that the attributes for each
potential route—such as travel times between two locations—can be determined. As a
12
Automated Vehicles and Automated Driving …
235
result, a transport demand model provides information on the location changes of the
study area’s population and the resultant trafﬁc volumes for individual modes of transport.
In practice, the individual stages of the model, presented here for the sake of simplicity as
a sequential process, often ﬁnd simultaneous or recursive application—choice of transport
mode and destination are combined particularly often. For a more in-depth look at
transport demand modeling, see [5, 24].
As a rule, transport demand models can be divided into microscopic and macroscopic
model approaches. These approaches differ both in view of the information and properties
required and the model logic in mapping decision interrelationships. Macroscopic demand
models, also often called Four-Step Models or FSM, directly reﬂect the four stages
mentioned above. Based on its socio-demographic, transport-related characteristics, the
population in the study area is subdivided into groups so that behavior within a group is as
similar as possible while deviating signiﬁcantly in comparison to the other groups.
Classiﬁcations are typically based on sex, age, employment status, and car owner-
ship. Usually, household context is not considered (for more details, see [18], inter alia).
In the course of modeling, all trips generated by group members are modeled collectively
and independently from other changes of location during the day in question. For further
description of macroscopic models, see [5, 22].
Particularly in regional modeling in the USA, so-called activity-based or microscopic
modeling approaches to transport demand have grown in signiﬁcance in recent years.
Compared to macroscopic models, these are more greatly focused on people’s individual
mobility decisions and consider a person’s detailed characteristics and household context
to a greater extent. A day’s individual trips are modeled jointly as tours starting and
ending at home. This form of representation allows for consideration of behavioral
interdependencies between individual activities and decisions. In the course of
microsimulation, the trip chains of all persons in the study area are calculated individually,
yielding an overall picture of transport demand. In-depth information on activity-based
modeling approaches can be found in [7, 10, 21].
12.3.2 Decision-Making Criteria in Applied Models of Transport
Mode Choice
Transport mode choice is of great signiﬁcance in demand modeling, with its results being
highly relevant for planning and policy [24]. Generally, discrete choice models or closely
related methods that presuppose strongly rational decision-making behavior are
employed. These statistical models help to identify the respective inﬂuencing factors and
the extent of their impact on decision-making. If one assumes that the total utility of a
choice alternative can be derived additively from the individual components, then beneﬁt
of choosing an option can be calculated and compared with other available alternatives.
The probability of selecting one variant increases with its relative advantages compared to
other options [20, 24]. The speciﬁed models can differ in their complexity (see [34],
236
R. Cyganski
for example). Transport mode choice models that are integrated into demand models,
however, usually only consider a few variables covering the characteristics of the transport
mode, the people, the trips, and the geographic structure.
In describing the available transport modes, the ﬁnancial and temporal costs of a choice
assume prime importance. In the case of cars it is primarily running costs that are con-
sidered, purchase and maintenance costs more rarely. Time costs are primarily taken to be
average onboard travel times. Less frequently, and then mainly for public transport, is
time spent getting to and from the bus or train included. In the latter case, the number of
transfers, waiting and transfer times, or even service frequencies are often also taken into
consideration. Elements such as the reliability of the travel time have until now mainly
been found in analytical models [4]. By using a transport mode speciﬁc constant,
moreover, utility components that cannot be further speciﬁed may be considered in
aggregate. Age, sex, income statues, driver’s license and car possession are among the
typical socio-demographic attributes in the models. Income variables, level of education,
and household size or number of children are rarer. In particular for socio-demographic
characteristics, it is common to interrelate with other attributes when determining their
utility components, thus allowing different levels of inﬂuence for speciﬁc groups of
people. Assessing transport modes may also depend on the trip purpose; interaction terms
speciﬁc to the trip purpose are thus also not uncommon. Distinguishing journeys to work
is particularly important here. But also the need to transport items, or commonly having
accompanying passengers for speciﬁc trip purposes, such as shopping or longer travelling,
may require corresponding differentiation. Geographic and contextual characteristics form
a further area. Ofﬁcial geographic typiﬁcation, or population density at the residential
location, e.g., can be used to differentiate between rural and densely populated areas.
Factors describing the parking situation, parking costs or possible toll areas can also be
found in some models.
Transport demand models are strongly data-driven and presuppose that quantitative
statements on interdependencies can be made. In the absence of sufﬁcient data, numerous
factors known to be relevant for transport mode choice can often only be included in
models in simpliﬁed form. This particularly affects so-called “soft factors” such as
routines, transport modes’ perceived comfort and reliability, the pleasure associated with
traveling by such means, the social standing conveyed, individual safety requirements,
and propensity for privacy. It is not only attitudinal factors, however, that are examples of
issues that, despite their known relevance, have hitherto hardly been considered in
transport demand modeling, but also knowledge of alternatives, the potential effort needed
to plan, and also the way in which households come to collective decisions (see [35],
among others).
Mapping new transport modes poses a particular challenge, moreover. The liberaliza-
tion of long-distance bus services in Germany, the introduction of station-based carsharing
services, or even the introduction of electric cars onto the market are examples of modi-
ﬁcations of existing transport provisions where forecasting usage patterns has proved to be
difﬁcult and reliable ﬁgures on interdependencies are lacking. But even differentiating
12
Automated Vehicles and Automated Driving …
237
between the various current modes using “hard” factors is not always easy. Transport
models have historically mainly been employed to calculate the vehicle miles travelled. As
recently as 2012, Bates showed that four-stage models contained barely more than one
distinction between “private modes,” i.e. car usage, and “public modes”. These have only
recently been extended to include other aspects, such as distinctions between driver and
passenger [5]. Distinguishing among cars, for example according to size or type of drive,
has only latterly been introduced in modeling. This all amounts to a series of signiﬁcant
challenges when integrating automated vehicles into the analysis. Ultimately, it is a matter
of examining “the car” more closely and enabling clear differentiation between driving and
being driven, a car you own and a car you hire, or a taxi, even.
12.4
What Impact Might the Roll Out of Automated Vehicles
Have on Our Behavior in Choosing Transport Modes?
Before examining the question of how automated vehicles can be looked at in transport
modeling, it must be explained how the introduction of these systems might affect
individual daily mobility. In general, the potential use of automated vehicles, or also of
new mobility options, greatly depends on their possible applications and the advantages
they offer compared to other modes on offer—that is to say, on factors relevant to how
automated vehicles are judged compared to other modes when choosing transport modes.
Such factors should then, as far as possible, be included in models. For the use cases
described mostly in technical or legal terms in Chap. 2, I will therefore begin with a
discussion of possible usage variants. Central issues requiring further examination here
include: how to typify the expected users, the trip purposes and intended uses for which
corresponding systems are particularly suited, the geographic or contextual characteristics
that make it necessary to use public transport, the relevant transport mode characteristics
and the transport mode substitution that may result from this. The discussion is hereby
focused on characteristics suitable for depiction in transport models.
12.4.1 Interstate Pilot: The Car with that Special Something
for Exceptional Circumstances?
Interstate Pilot may come to be the entry level for automation, as the driving task remains
except in exceptional circumstances. The two main aspects of Interstate Pilot from a user
perspective are easing the driver’s workload and the possibility of spending travelling
time in other ways.
The use of Interstate Pilot will only be possible on speciﬁc stretches of road, and thus
mainly on long-distance trips. For this reason, it may be assumed that this system would
mainly positively impact how cars are perceived and assessed in the case of longer
journeys. In addition, Continental’s user survey clearly shows that handing over the
driving task is positively connoted, especially in stressful or tiresome situations such as
238
R. Cyganski
trafﬁc jams or roadworks [8]. It is also not uncommon, however, to associate such a
handover with restricting the pleasure of driving [1].
After increased road safety, the possibility of an altered use of time, mostly associated
with increased meaningfulness or productivity, is arguably the most-mentioned advantage
of automated vehicles (see [23, 26, 30, 32], for example). For working people and those
with great private commitments in particular, and for trips with children or with other
passengers, this could lead to time spent travelling being viewed more positively—one of
the most important factors for transport mode choice in models. In the end, this may lead to
longer trips on public transportation being assessed relatively more negatively, particularly
by people who use this time actively, and to cars being perceived as the more-comfortable
alternative, leading to them gaining in popularity. The signiﬁcance of the alternative time
usage is, however, difﬁcult to assess. In the Continental study, for example, only around a
third of respondents stated that they found an alternative time use attractive [8].
12.4.2 Valet Parking—Never Look for a Parking Space Again?
Valet Parking is a function in more or less “normal,” only slightly modiﬁed cars, where
the driving task remains unchanged. The vehicle only takes over the task of parking and
driving to pick its occupants up autonomously within a deﬁned radius upon user request.
According to a survey by AutoScout24, just under two thirds of respondents would
happily use this function and never again search for a parking space themselves. Among
residents of urban districts, this percentage is higher, as would be expected [1]: The
function is mainly of beneﬁt in areas with a low number of private parking spaces, where
there is pressure on parking, and long distances from homes or destinations to their
respective parking spaces (see also Chap. 20). It thus helps to save time and also parking
costs, where applicable [19], and it provides greater convenience, particularly when
transporting items or children, and for people with restricted personal mobility. Even if
greater use of carsharing is discussed primarily in the case of Vehicle on Demand (see
[11]), less time and effort spent getting to the car with Valet Parking may possibly ease the
use of carsharing. Consequences that we can be surer of include a substantial drop in
parking search trafﬁc, and an accompanying fall in travel times in areas previously
affected by this.
12.4.3 Arriving Comfortably and Safely in a Fully Automated
Vehicle
Fully automated driving is the “crème de la crème of driver-assistance systems” [3].
Although the human driver will—at least provisionally—need to be in a position to take
over the driving task, this should only be necessary when desired. Given sufﬁcient rates of
penetration, this driving concept is linked with a vision of safe, reliable personal mobility
12
Automated Vehicles and Automated Driving …
239
and improved trafﬁc ﬂow leading to less time spent travelling and in jams, as well as
making the planning of journey times and costs more predictable [3, 26, 30]. At the same
time, it may be assumed that inhibitions regarding car usage and ownership will decrease,
especially for users who are inexperienced, uncertain or older. The car would thus
become, for instance, a more attractive option in unfavorable driving conditions such as
darkness, unknown or longer routes, and in bad weather conditions (see also [11]). One
consequence of this is a possible fall in the number of escorting trips and the use of taxis
and public transport, and a corresponding increase in car ownership.
The most frequently cited advantage from users’ point of view, however, is the
associated hope—analogous to Interstate Pilot—of being “given time that I can use solely
for me” [26]. It is therefore no surprise that this technology’s target group is mostly seen
as being working commuters (see [17] for example)—fully automated driving provides,
precisely in urban densely populated areas, meaningful use of time spent on-board. This
beneﬁt is likely to result in a more positive evaluation of the car, especially if time spent in
cars was not previously perceived as productive, and pleasure in driving not a priority. We
thus see it is particularly people who are not the most passionate drivers who most desire
to use such a function [17].
12.4.4 Vehicle on Demand—Zipcar on Steroids?
A scenario involving a ﬂeet of vehicles that is in large part available and usable for
everyone, particularly in urban areas, would undoubtedly have the most wide-ranging
impact on daily transport behavior. A logical extension of fully automated vehicles, but
with no option of taking over the driving function, it would allow for independent per-
sonal mobility even for those without a driver’s license or their own car: children, the
elderly, people who are sensory or mobility impaired, etc. (see [19], among others).
In general, we can assume that cars will gain in attractiveness as access and egress
times decreases, especially in areas with a parking-space shortage. Alongside the potential
drop in parking costs from being able to park further away from the destination, a clear fall
in the number of escorting trips may also be expected, as well as in the use of carpooling
and taxi services—possibly accompanied by an increase in empty runs.
At the same time, introducing Vehicle on Demand ﬂeets is universally expected to lead
to substantially lower rates of car ownership [19], [37], possibly accompanied by a boom
in carsharing use. With reference to the US carsharing ﬁrm, Silberg et al. [30] have even
spoken of “Zipcar on steroids”. It seems particularly plausible that two-car households
might substitute their second vehicle, which—depending on the situation in terms of
weather, parking availability, number of people travelling, etc.—would also allow a
speciﬁc vehicle to be selected accordingly (see [17, 37]).
Given Vehicle on Demand’s introduction, Fagnant and Kockelman [11] would expect
a substantial impact on individual car ownership. According to their simulation calcula-
tions for the USA, a single Vehicle on Demand could replace up to 13 private cars [11].
240
R. Cyganski
Studies on station-based carsharing in Germany put the substitution rates at up to eight
private cars replaced by a single carsharing vehicle [15]. Because Vehicles on Demand
can cover a wider catchment area by abolishing the need for trips from the starting point to
the vehicle, these ﬁgures do not appear unrealistic. A glance at carsharing’s current user
structure provides the ﬁrst clues as to the potential users of Vehicle on Demand. In
particular, younger people of higher-than-average education and income with distinct
interest in the environment use station-based carsharing in Germany. The fairly new
carsharing services that are not tied to stations, also known as ﬂexible carsharing, are
mainly used by urban males as a ﬂexible transport mode option for short trips (see [13,
14]). The use of Vehicle on Demand as an alternative to privately-owned cars might thus
directly lead to a boost in multimodal behavior in choosing transport modes, or contribute
to an increase in carpooling (see [26]). However, given that time spent in the vehicle is
often viewed positively, a rise in car use and mileage covered is also possible as a
consequence of their omnipresent availability ([11, 37], Chap. 20). These new mobility
concepts are examined in depth in Ch. 18.
But it is not only individual car ownership that may be subject to extensive changes in
such a scenario. Car services, taxis and public transport may ﬁnd that competition with
personal transport modes hots up anew. Especially in rural areas, Vehicle-on-Demand
ﬂeets could serve either as ﬂexible, individual feeder services for local public transport, or
as a way of comfortably covering the “last mile” for long-distance public services. Critical
analyses, however, also allow for the theory that they would not simply supplement public
mass transit, but in the long run could even replace it: “[…], eventually, mobility on
demand may prove a better investment than new mass transit systems” [17], an assessment
also shared by Willumsen [37]. In this case, assumptions that passenger kilometers
covered on an individual basis may rise steeply surely cannot be rejected out-of-hand.
12.4.5 The Car of the Future: Competition for Cars, Taxis or Trains?
Reviewing the literature as it stands shows that introducing automated vehicles could have
very diverse effects on our daily mobility and chosen means of transport. Automated
driving thus is not always only a lightly modiﬁed version of our long-familiar cars that
will improve trafﬁc ﬂow and travel times and provide support functions as desired, as
suggested by a graphic in the KMPG study [17]. Rather, its potential effects differ
enormously for existing private transport modes, and even public ones. The wide-ranging
implications resulting from the various scenarios for the whole transport system and the
use of public space generally are explored in depth in Chap. 20. The possible effects on
transport mode choice, as seen in the literature above, clearly show that the characteristics
relevant for perception and valuation of the vehicles in the various usage scenarios may be
very different. These diverse requirements must be borne in mind when analyzing any
potential mapping of automated vehicles in transport demand modeling.

What Potential Applications Do Users Anticipate
for Automated Vehicles? Initial Survey Findings
Quantitative studies on the topic of automated driving have been carried out sporadically
since 2012 [1, 8, 17]. The surveys have largely focused on issues of attitudes and
acceptance, or on desired support functions. With its questions on anticipated usage and
alternative time use, Continental’s mobility study from 2013 [8] is noteworthy in this
connection. However, all of the studies have in common that they do not consider any
differentiation in the possible forms of automated driving, and are not targeted at possible
behavioral changes or potential intended applications.
For this reason, a survey was carried in June 2014 which provides the basis for the
empirical ﬁndings of both this article and those on the form of the human–machine
interface (Chap. 26) and the acceptance of automated vehicles (Chap. 28). This
quasi-representative online survey addresses respondents’ attitudes and their anticipation
of how they would use automated vehicles in the project’s various use cases. The sample
comprises of 250 complete questionnaires per usage scenario (total 1000) and is stratiﬁed
according to sex, age, income and education. Using quantitative methods, the dataset al-
lows for an initial evaluation of various user groups’ attitudes to automated driving and
mobility provision. This supplements the previous section’s ﬁndings. From a demand
modeling perspective, the survey’s aim is mainly to comprehend what differentiations
with respect to users, trip purposes, intended applications, and transport mode charac-
teristics are relevant when modeling automated vehicles. Also, data analysis should
provide the ﬁrst indications of which transport modes, from today’s perspective, auto-
mated vehicles would compete with for users, and of how time spent traveling may
change, and how these changes are viewed.
The
questionnaire
begins
with
questions
covering
the
respondents’
socio-demographics, their knowledge of and interest in automated driving, and their
previous experience of assistance systems. This is followed by questions on their current
use of, and attitudes to, existing transport modes and the usual way they spend time when
using them. The respondents also answer in-depth questions on one of the project use
cases—Interstate Pilot, Automated Valet Parking, Full Automation and Vehicle on
Demand (see Chap. 2). Topics include anticipated use, the transport mode that would be
replaced, attitudes towards the vehicle described, the need to be able to intervene, various
aspects of the experience, and speciﬁc design wishes. The scenarios are described fairly
brieﬂy to leave room for the respondents’ own interpretations. A tabular overview of the
participants’ socio-demographic characteristics and the sample structure can be found in
Chap. 26.

12.5.1 Who Can Imagine Substituting Their Previously Preferred
Transport Mode?
To evaluate automated driving’s impact on transport mode choice, it is especially
important to know what transport modes automated vehicles may replace. To this end, in
one of its ﬁrst questions, the survey enquires into participants’ basic willingness to sub-
stitute their preferred transport mode with an automated vehicle—at this stage an undif-
ferentiated one. As the questionnaire continues, the respondents are also asked, for one of
the use cases, if they could imagine using the vehicle speciﬁed or substituting their
preferred transport mode with it. The results were also examined as to whether signiﬁcant
differences could be seen in answers according to respondents’ socio-demographic
characteristics and attitudes.1 Corresponding relevant statistical values can be se seen as
indicators that, when integrating behavior into the models, it should be differentiated
according to these criteria—the speciﬁc strengths or tendency of the effect is of secondary
importance at ﬁrst.
Figure 12.1 gives the respective answers on substitution desires, which tend to cor-
respond to the general willingness to use automated vehicles (see Chap. 27). It is striking
that the majority of respondents can either hardly imagine, or cannot imagine at all, giving
an automated vehicle preference over their standard transport mode. Fewer than 15 % of
respondents agree with the statement of wanting to use an automated vehicle—no matter
what kind—predominantly or as a full replacement. While the proportion of undecideds is
very high for the general statement, the agreement value falls sharply for the speciﬁc
scenarios, between which there is statistically signiﬁcant variation. With only around a
quarter of positive answers, the Vehicle on Demand use case stands out here as being
regarded with especial skepticism. Full Automation, on the other hand, is viewed most
positively on average.

1In the following, differences are indicated as statistically signiﬁcant when exhibiting values of 0.05
or lower in a Pearson’s chi-squared test. For some variables, particularly attitudinal or geographic
ones, a test was not always possible, due to the number of cases in individual answer categories.

A differentiated analysis of the desire to switch modes can reveal statistically highly
signiﬁcant differences in terms of household size, presence of children, income, and the
number of cars in a household. The most clearly discriminatory factor, however, is atti-
tudes towards cars. These are revealed in questions on what people associate with car
driving and whether they take pleasure in it, and also whether respondents could set up
their daily lives without a car. Residential location also produces clear differences in the
answers. Rural dwellers, for example, are less skeptical in their answers than people in
cities. Sex, levels of education and income, in contrast, do not have a statistically
signiﬁcant impact on the answers given, nor does shortage of parking at home or other
main reference locations. Looking at the individual usage scenarios, it is notable that there
is higher skepticism towards Vehicle on Demand among women, as well as marked
differences in the answer patterns vis-à-vis Valet Parking, depending on the presence of
children, household size, and income.
The participants were also asked how, in their opinion, using an automated vehicle
from one of the scenarios would affect their previous transport mode use. The answers
were given separately for each previous transport mode and ranged from “far less often”
(−2) to “far more often” (+2). The large percentage of those who assume no change in
their behavior is also conspicuous here: With the exception of taxis and conventional cars,
a number of respondents consistently between 50 and 64 % state they foresee no change in
their transport mode use. The respective mean values of answers given for individually
anticipated mode shift effects are shown in Table 12.1. A mean value of 0 is to be taken as
indifference. Taxi use is estimated to fall in all scenarios. It is noticeable that Valet Parking
produces the greatest associations of switching—particularly from taxi use, with its very
low mean value of −0.78.

12.5.2 What Do Respondents See as the Specific Advantage
of Automated Vehicles?
A further question asks for which intended applications and trip characteristics the
respondents would ﬁnd automated vehicles to be particularly helpful. The answers’ mean
values are given in Table 12.2. With the exception of escorting trips, there are consistently
highly signiﬁcant differences between the scenarios. This indicates that the respondents
may clearly differentiate between the scenarios. The comparatively high agreement values
for Full Automation for long-distance trips and excursions are noteworthy, to a lesser
extent for trips with higher occupancy rates. Valet Parking is viewed as particularly
helpful in urban contexts and for transporting items.
A differentiated analysis points out the fact that, for all trip purposes, male respondents
have statistically signiﬁcantly higher rates of agreement for Vehicle on Demand. This is
also the case for work and long-distance trips using Interstate Pilot. We also see that
education levels, as measured by university-entrance diploma, have a signiﬁcant impact
on attitudes to Vehicle on Demand for long-distance (cross-country) trips, excursions and
escorting trips. The presence of children in the household has a signiﬁcantly positive
impact on how useful Full Automation is viewed for trips in the city as well as
cross-country. No correlation was seen for escorting trips, however. On long-distance and

urban trips, the answers given for Valet Parking differ depending on household size and
the presence of children. Employment status2 almost exclusively determines differences in
the answers for Valet Parking on long trips, journeys to work, and for leisure activities; the
latter also being conditioned by income level.
12.5.3 What Do We Do on the Road Today, and What Will We Do
Tomorrow?
The possibility of pursuing other activities during a journey is one of automated driving’s
main features from a usage point of view. At the same time, time costs are a main driver of
transport mode choice in models. To conclude, we shall therefore cast our eyes on the
survey results regarding previous and also, perhaps, future time use.
The respondents were ﬁrst asked how they generally occupied themselves while
travelling on (urban) public transport, on (long-distance) trains or in cars. By far the most
mentioned activity on public transport was enjoying the landscape and the journey: 50 %
of respondents stated doing this frequently or always on public transport, 66 % on trains.
Conversation with a companion or other passengers is similarly popular (public transport:
42 %, trains: 49 %), followed by listening to music, reading or relaxing. Around 77 and
69 % of respondents stated they never work on local or long-distance journeys respec-
tively; just under 6 and 8 % frequently or always. The answers on working while on the
move differ for train travel to statistically signiﬁcant degrees according to sex, income,
level of education, household size, and the presence of children. For example, 74 % of
women and 63 % of men stated they never work on trains. Compared to comparably lower
income groups, the likelihood of frequently or always working on board a train doubles
with a net household income of over 2600 euros to around 10 %.
The current main activity in cars is, naturally, concentrating on the drive and the route.
Around 80 % of respondents also frequently or always listen to music, around two thirds
talk to their companions, and over half frequently or always enjoy the trip and landscape
while on the road. Seven percent state they sometimes work in cars.
Of the beneﬁts that respondents perceive automated driving as having in terms of
alternative time use during a journey, the most mentioned are being able to have con-
versations and enjoy the landscape—the most popular current activities in cars. As an
example, Fig. 12.2 shows the answers for fully automated vehicles. The low proportion of
those who see a beneﬁt in being able to work while on the move is notable; in the case of
Interstate Pilot this is less than a quarter of respondents.
2Employment status is classed as either full- or part-time employment, or other occupation.

Automated Vehicles in Demand Modeling: The Potential
for, and Limits to, Their Integration
Analyzing the possible effects of the various use cases clearly demonstrates the necessity
of differentiation when integrating automated vehicles into demand modeling. While the
Interstate Pilot and Valet Parking functions are both to a great extent particular, tem-
porarily restricted special forms of an otherwise largely unchanged form of car driving and
vehicle, the introduction of fully automated vehicles involves a practically new mode of
transport or, in the case of a Vehicle on Demand ﬂeet, potentially a completely new type
of mobility provision.
Surely the greatest challenge in integrating automated driving into demand modeling
lies in facilitating greater differentiation of the mode of passenger transport known as the
“car.” The conventional description of this transport mode option is based on the main
criteria of travel time, running costs, and an often not further speciﬁed preference structure
of the decision maker. Above all, this lacks the possibility of giving the role of the driver
and the ownership status sufﬁcient consideration. Differentiating between driving and
being driven, and between driving one’s own vehicle or any other one, is a prerequisite of
adequate mapping. Only in this way is it possible to distinguish the role of the driver from
that of the passenger or someone being chauffeured under Full Automation. Just as
necessary is differentiation between conventional cars, fully automated vehicles, taxis, or
hired Vehicles on Demand. The desire to integrate automated vehicles into the modeling
therefore goes hand in hand with the need to describe the currently available individual
alternatives with greater differentiation. The ﬂuid transition between being a driver and a
quasi-passenger, as experienced in the cases of Interstate Pilot and Full Automation,
depending on the user and the journey, poses a particular challenge.
The time spent traveling is one of the most inﬂuential drivers of transport mode choice
in current modeling. In modeling public transport, it is common to distinguish between
on-board or actual travel time, waiting time, and time spent getting to and from the station
or stop. This allows the time components to be evaluated differently. Until now, however,

Automated Vehicles and Automated Driving …
247
time spent in the vehicle has not been analyzed in any great depth, be it for public
transport or any other mode. The expectations accompanying the introduction of auto-
mated vehicles, of being able to spend time in the vehicle in a subjectively more mean-
ingful way, clearly indicate the necessity for differentiation in the models. Journey
distance and duration, and thus also the potential usable proportion of the journey, merit
greater attention here, as are the questions of which alternative activities are sought and
with whom the journey is made.
But it is not only the time in the vehicle that is subject to change, there is also the most
notable of the changes resulting from Valet Parking: minimizing the effort needed to use
the mode at the beginning and end of the journey. The same applies for Vehicle on
Demand. Again, we see here the necessity of further differentiating the often sweeping
analysis of time spent traveling depending on the transport mode chosen. Concrete
examples of this include the waiting time for a taxi and the time spent getting to one’s own
car, or a hired one.
One aspect that can be comparatively easily integrated into models, in simpliﬁed form,
is the shortening of travel times resulting directly from the lack of trafﬁc jams and trafﬁc
related to parking searches. More problematic is that the effect of increasingly reliable
travel-time predictions on how cars are viewed as an alternative transport mode is usually
unmapped in models. The increased convenience resulting from new functions such as
Valet Parking or Interstate Pilot, the potential safety gains, and the greater ﬂexibility of
vehicle equipment are further examples of relevant subjective criteria that have barely
been considered at all in model-based analyses up to now. The difﬁculty of recording
subjective aspects, quantifying their effects, and taking them into consideration as factors
in transport mode selection applies not only to a mode’s properties, however, but also at
least as much to describing the user. In particular, fun while driving, the perception of
one’s own driving skills, the readiness to hand over the driving function, the aversion to
any potential loss of control, and trust in technology are all examples of factors that
acquire greater relevance precisely in how automated vehicles are viewed (see Chap. 28).
Such factors should thus be given greater attention in modeling.
Identifying user groups that differ in terms of how they assess the various transport
mode options is one of the most important bases of describing people in models. Both the
literature-based impact analysis and the survey results clearly indicate that automated
vehicles’ real or perceived beneﬁts differ not only depending on the scenario, but also
according to attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics. Besides the standard attri-
butes of sex, employment status, age, and driver’s license, further distinguishing factors
that proved relevant included, depending on the usage scenario, presence of children in a
household, level of education, and household income. In the course of representating
automated vehicles, an expansion of the attributes used in models to describe people, and
particularly their household context, consequently requires debate. Furthermore, it is also
the case here that attitudinal factors, such as attitudes towards different transport modes,
routines or temporal constraints, are hardly ever considered.
248
R. Cyganski
For transport mode choice, holding a driver’s license and access to a car are especially
relevant individual and household attributes. The latter is generally expressed via the number
of cars in a household or their actual availability on the behavioral survey’s sample day. In
macroscopic modeling, car availability is the standard criterion used to distinguish between
user groups and determine trip rates. For transport mode selection itself, then, general car
availabilityispresumed.Microscopictransportmodelspermitconsiderationofdriver’slicense
possession as well as the actual car availability within the selection situation—whether con-
straints result from competition for a vehicle’s use within the household or, especially, in the
course of a trip chain. Systems such as Vehicle on Demand systematically break down this
restriction to availability—this type of car can theoretically be selected as a new mobility
option by anybody at any time. Just as with carsharing systems, adequate model representation
requires a rethinking of, not least, the geographic and social criteria of car availability.
The consideration of geographic and contextual attributes, and the differentiation of
possible usage or trip purposes, were given as further criteria for transport mode choice in
models in Sect. 12.3.2. Particularly in the Valet Parking use case, the importance of
geographic factors for how useful an option is perceived to be is intuitively apparent.
Although the degree of detail in demand modeling is generally high enough to provide
information about settlement structure, general land-use structure, and building density,
details of building structure—crucial to whether there is sufﬁcient public or even private
parking—are not usually given. Detailed modeling of parking-space availability, pressure
on parking space and the associated costs, and the time needed to get to and from parked
cars are rarities (see Sect. 12.3.2). In this ﬁeld, a general need for improvement can be
stated if an adequate modeling of Valet Parking is to be achieved.
Vehicle on Demand is another example in which urban structure determines usage and
the state of competition between existing transport modes to a considerable extent. It
particularly forms an alternative to private cars, taxis, and public transport in urban areas,
for example, whereas in rural areas it is mainly seen as a potential feeder service, and thus
as a supplement to public transport. The job of modeling is therefore to anticipate
worthwhile deployment concepts and availabilities, and to integrate these into the inter-
modal supply models. Further desirable improvements in transport supply models include
the incorporation of parking-search trafﬁc, and identifying route sections that are prime
candidates for the use of automation.
The Vehicle on Demand use case makes it particularly clear what fundamental impact
automated vehicles might have on our vehicle ownership, and thus on our everyday
mobility decisions. The modeling and quantiﬁcation of causal interrelationships—between
ownership or other options for accessing a vehicle and its most important features, such as
being equipped with Valet Parking or Full Automation on the one hand, and the
supply-side, the geographic setting, and socio-demographic characteristics of the
respective household on the other—take on increased signiﬁcance here. The conventional
approach of allowing solely for the ownership of an average car as an input parameter is
being more and more superseded, especially for emissions calculations, by upstream
models incorporating a household car’s drive type, size class, price segment, number of
12

249
seats, or cargo capacity. Support functions such as Valet Parking, however, play just as
small a role in this as the alternative of carsharing membership or getting rid of a car due
to good provision of alternative transport modes. It is not just the question of who could
substitute owning a car with hiring one or being driven that remains unanswered in
conventional means of modeling. Assuming that the combination of privately owned cars
and various Vehicles on Demand particularly promotes the ﬂexible adaptation of vehicle
choice to the respective usage situation, then the necessity to gather and analyze the
necessary data, and correspondingly expand the modeling becomes apparent.
12.7
Summary and Outlook
It is generally expected that automated vehicles in various forms will form part of our daily
mobility in the near future. Integrating the relevant transport options into demand modeling—
one of the most important instruments in planning—is thus both equally challenging and
necessary. Existing empirical work on the expected impact has until now focused primarily on
the technology. At the same time,looking into the future isnaturally fullof uncertainty,and the
effects of new technologies can only be appraised with difﬁculty.
If one looks at the individual use cases with regard to their potential impact on transport
mode choice, then the need to distinguish between them is immediately apparent. Both Valet
Parking and Interstate Pilot are mainly associated with lightly modiﬁed “normal” cars that
offer a beneﬁt in special situations: improved access to the vehicle and no need to search for a
parking space in the case of Valet Parking, optional handing over of the driving function on
selected routes or in special driving situations in the case of Interstate Pilot. The introduction
of fully automated vehicles brings with it the idea of a substantial improvement in how time
spent traveling in the vehicle is assessed, accompanied by fewer obstructions to car use.
Far-reaching effects on the whole transport system can above all be seen in the scenario of
broad availability of Vehicles on Demand, where individual mobility will be possible
independently of driver proﬁciency or vehicle ownership. Presumably, this driverless urban
carsharing will lead to a reduction in escorting trips and taxi use, as well as a clear drop in car
ownership. In the countryside, it could open up access to public transport.
An online survey was employed to examine whether respondents could imagine using
an automated vehicle in various usage scenarios and what transport modes they have been
using until now these kinds of vehicles would substitute. Besides general skepticism,
which even increased when the various scenarios were speciﬁed, the sizable inﬂuence of
currently held attitudes towards cars is apparent. Sharp falls in taxi use are anticipated in
particular. The speciﬁc advantages of automated vehicles are envisaged for long journeys
especially, and also in the urban context in the case of Valet Parking. Taking pleasure in
the journey and the landscape, and talking with fellow passengers are currently the pre-
ferred activities in both local and long-distance travel with public transport; more than two
thirds of respondents state that they never work on the move. While travelling in cars,
listening to music and conversation are among the most common activities. When asked
250
R. Cyganski
about future time use when driving automated vehicles, enjoying the landscape and
chatting are likewise the most prominent responses.
Not all factors relevant to how automated vehicles are perceived and evaluated can be
incorporated into transport models, with their simpliﬁed representation of causal interrela-
tionships in trafﬁc generation. In particular, non-rational, “soft” perception and assessment
factors, such as fun while driving, or the desire/reluctance to hand over the driving task, can
only be empirically grasped and considered in models with difﬁculty. Both the empirical
basis and the implementation in models show a need and potential for expansion here.
The main challenge in integrating automated vehicles, however, lies in what until now
has only been a rudimentary differentiation of “cars” in models. Improvements in the
empirical foundation, and the possibilities for integrating it into models, are again required
here, including an underlining of the role of the driving task and vehicle ownership in
transport mode choice. The aim is to allow for clearer distinctions between driving and
being driven, between fully automated vehicles and ones which assist only when desired,
and between privately owned cars, hired cars, and taxis. The need to rethink vehicle
ownership as a ﬁxed input variable is also apparent here.
The possibility of spending time on the move in different ways is, alongside safety, one of
the most-mentioned beneﬁts of the automation of driving. Time costs are also a key factor in
modal choice in transport demand modeling. Until now, however, no differentiation of travel
timehas usually beenprovidedfor inmodels. Itisnot currently possibletodistinguish between
time spent in a “meaningful” way and time “wasted,” between actively enjoying driving and
being stuck in tiresome trafﬁc jams, and between productive work and relaxed listening to
music. Such an expansion of the models is not in principle difﬁcult—initially independent of
which alternative activity is actually being sought after. However, it is again evident that there
are substantial gaps in the empirical foundation upon which demand modeling is built, that
need ﬁlling before an adequate integration of automated driving can be achieved.

Effects of Autonomous Driving
on the Vehicle Concept
Hermann Winner and Walther Wachenfeld
13.1
Introduction
Since Carl Benz invented the automobile in 1886, some very different vehicle concepts
have been developed. Some can be regarded as the logical continued development and
replacement of former concepts, such as the renunciation of the carriage design and the
integration of the wheels and chassis under the (self supporting) body. The main factor
that inﬂuences the vehicle concept is the purpose. This can particularly be seen when
considering commercial vehicles. However, a wide range of passenger cars has also been
developed, from convertibles and SUVs characterized by the owner’s lifestyle to
multi-purpose vehicles with sedans and hatchbacks as well as station wagons and (mini)
vans. The type of use is even more important for small delivery vans, minibuses and what
are known as light trucks on other markets. Under the hood, there has been a move toward
transversely installed front engines with front-wheel drive over the past decades, after the
dominance of longitudinally installed engines with rear-wheel drive. Furthermore, there is
currently a trend towards electriﬁcation of the power train, deemed more sustainable due
to CO2 speciﬁcations, less noise emission and other advantages. Despite all these changes,
it is not expected that the existing drive concepts will “die out”, since the divergence in the
optimization aims of the different market segments will continue to support this diversi-
ﬁcation of concepts. For example, a rural area in the USA has completely different drive
requirements to a big city in China.

The diversity of vehicle models available on the market is accompanied by the concept
diversity of “show cars” presented at motor shows. Assistance systems and partial
automation are only concept changing in very few cases for familiar vehicles. The visible
trend over the past years of poorer outward visibility in vehicles, justiﬁed by styling
requirements and/or requirements relating to the body rigidity does, however, support the
use of compensating systems such as ultrasound parking aids, rear-view cameras or the
surround-view display. However, driver assistance systems generally do not change the
concept, as only a few are included as standard equipment for a vehicle model series. As a
result, the vehicle manufacturer is required to design the vehicle so that vehicles without
this equipment can also be safely driven by the driver. As the willingness and ability of the
driver to take over are also prerequisites for partially automated driving [1], major changes
compared with conventional vehicles cannot be expected. Only concepts that beneﬁt a
takeover, such as new human–machine interfaces for assigning a partially automated
function may ﬁnd their way in [2]. Not only former concepts, but also current
drive-by-wire concepts with alternative control elements (see [3]) were restricted to
replacing the function of the steering wheel and pedals without providing a design for the
automation of the higher vehicle guidance levels that are indispensable for automated
driving.
Although it is not yet possible to determine a trend toward another concept due to
higher levels of automation, this may change with a considerable change in vehicle
guidance. This results in the following question: If the opportunity of autonomous driving
unsettles the current world of concepts, is this due to a signiﬁcant shift in market shares or
due to new concepts?
Before addressing this question in detail, the key conceptual features must be deﬁned in
order to create a level plane that applies to the overall vehicle and so that the even more
diverse world of detailed solutions can be faded out. Prior to this, the requirements that
will dominate concept selection in the future should be identiﬁed.
Figure 13.1 shows a selection of areas from which the requirements result. Many of the
requirements are linked physically—often with conﬂicts—and can only be combined after
a process of weighing up and prioritizing, for example streamlined aerodynamics versus
distinctive styling components.
A distinction is made between the following domains
– Vehicle body
– Drive
– Chassis
– Interior
– Human–Machine Interface (HMI)
for this discussion of the top concept level. As major vehicle component clusters, these are
always linked to the occupants and the environment, especially the road environment.
The interaction between these areas can be represented abstractly as transfer of mass,
energy and signals (see Fig. 13.2). Since vehicle automation radically changes this

transfer, the modules are also affected. One example of the effect of automation is the
exchange of signals between the environment and humans. The occupant no longer has to
pursue the task of driving and therefore no longer has to exchange signals with the
surroundings in order to reach the destination. This approach based on the transfer of
mass, energy and signals makes the further structuring of the analysis possible, taking
interfaces into account.
These concept-deﬁning areas and their interfaces for the use cases selected in Chap. 2
as well as the application scenarios possible as a result are examined in the following.
13.2
Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability
Although the two use cases “Interstate Pilot” and “Full Automation” have very different
performance capabilities when it comes to autonomous driving, there are no differences
when it comes to considering vehicle concepts, since both use cases are restricted to
having a driver available for extended availability. For the “Full Automation” use case,
autonomous driving can be used more extensively and a takeover is requested less often.
However, in both cases it must be ensured that vehicle guidance is possible without
restriction by a person with driver’s license in their function as a driver for extended
availability. Therefore, for both cases, the vehicle guidance is to be supported as a “mixed
mode”—autonomous or manual.
13.2.1 Effects on the Body Design
Compared with the expected comparison concepts, which do not provide autonomous
driving capability, no concept-deﬁning change is perceptible for the planned continued
manual vehicle guidance. For, as long as the extension and availability use-case concepts
(see Chap. 2) are based on control by the driver, the degree of freedom when it comes to
the body design is restricted. The external dimensions of the vehicle, as well as the
positioning and size of the windows, must still be tailored to the driver, meaning that
designs similar to those today are to be expected.
Sensors are required for virtually every viewing angle for autonomous driving, which
will surely result in complex package solutions if discreet visibility is aimed for as to date.
If a standard is actually to be set given for the capability to drive autonomously, this
would be beneﬁcial for the developers as they would be able to occupy outstanding sensor
positions in the true sense of the word (see Fig. 13.3 as an example). Otherwise, no major
deviation between the vehicle concept and comparison vehicles is expected, since these
use cases “only” add a new feature to the existing concepts without affecting the basic
principle of the vehicle or the application area.
258
H. Winner and W. Wachenfeld
13.2.2 Effects on the Drive Concept
There is no reason to evaluate the drive concept differently for the potentially remaining
manual journey segments than for similar vehicles that are not autonomous. However,
autonomous driving simpliﬁes incorporation into the trafﬁc telematics compared with
manual driving, making more efﬁcient driving possible. The driving characteristics can be
controlled depending on time and energy requirements. In principle, these options are
already available on vehicles with partial or highly automated driving functions, meaning
that the next step towards autonomous driving results in barely any relevant changes to the
drive concept. It is more the new networking options which beneﬁt the drive concepts
with lower overall availability, such as battery-electric drives.
13.2.3 Effects on the Chassis Design
While manual driving needs a chassis with the standard requirements, long phases of
autonomous driving enable the occupant(s) to be decoupled from the driving process.
Automation needs neither tactile sensitivity for driving dynamics nor the transverse and

longitudinal force action which impacts the occupants with vehicle acceleration. It can
revert to the vehicle motion sensors that have long been in use for electronic stability
control in order to regulate the trajectory so as to make the latter dynamic and
comfortable.
A tilted chassis as available for rail transportation for some time could at least com-
pensate for the standard moderate lateral accelerations of 1–2 m/s2. This would require an
overall tilting angle of approximately 6–12°. This overall tilting angle can be represented
by the tilting angle of the road surface, the vehicle conﬁguration roll angle and the seat
angle, see Fig. 13.4. It seems possible that lateral force compensation can be achieved
using the chassis alone, as the 2014 market launch in the S-Class Coupé model of
Mercedes-Benz initially shows. By contrast, the deﬂection and rebound required for
longitudinal force compensation is more than double the current spring travel. To achieve
a compensation in the speciﬁed range here too, this would only be possible by imple-
menting (separately or additional) seat tilting.
As fascinating as the idea of a journey free from longitudinal and lateral forces is,
especially for rest periods, it is equally problematic with respect to the desired visual
connection between humans and their environment, since the visual impression no longer
matches the kinesthetic and vestibular impression. However, even with visual decoupling,
the rotational acceleration which is sensed in the vestibular organ can cause occupants to
feel unwell. This is because, unlike translational acceleration, this cannot be compensated
for if the passenger cell cannot be turned against the vehicle’s direction of travel. In
addition, it is not possible to adjust the tilt angle without rotational velocity and accel-
erations, which signiﬁcantly reduce the tilt dynamics. Thus, with a perception limit for the
rotational acceleration (rolling) of 4°/s2 as determined in experiments [6, 7], the target
angle for acceleration compensation is not achieved for 2.5 s. With a very anticipatory
autonomous driving style where there are no external interferences, such as other vehicles
which have to be reacted to with high changes in acceleration, this can just still be
considered in trajectory planning. The perception limit used is the result of an experiment
and therefore dependent on the underlying test setup. Other experiments give different
values depending on the corresponding test setup, the rotation axis and the test person
(0.3–6°/s2). A compilation of different studies into this topic can be found in [7–9].

Compensating for the disturbance from vertical forces seems to be simpler. In con-
junction with the front surroundings sensors, the feeling of a sedan chair should be
possible. For reasons of safety this decoupling should be deactivated in order to give
priority to the driving dynamics. This sedan chair could be based on electronically con-
trolled air suspension concepts with adjustable dampers or fully active electromechanical
spring-damper units. Relevant counter measures generally have to be taken in order to
avoid low-frequency pitching movements which cause “seasickness”.
13.2.4 Effects on the Vehicle Interior and Human–Machine
Interaction
The necessity of an available driver means that a driver’s workplace must always be
provided. For this reason, the arrangement of the vehicle interior will be characterized by
the need for a seat with a dashboard and operating elements. This means that no major
concept changes are to be expected within the framework of the use cases considered
(Interstate Pilot and Full Automation). As an alternative to the currently familiar human
vehicle control using a steering wheel and pedals, an alternative control concept may be
implemented, drawing on partially automated basic functionalities. This could also be
linked with other space-saving control elements. Otherwise, several concept vehicle
examples include the option of moving the control elements, particularly the steering
wheel, to a less disturbing position, meaning that the space in front of the driver is
available for the “alternative program” during autonomous driving. Some kind of lock for
the operating controls may also be required so that they are not accessed accidentally,
causing an unintentional takeover.
As well as using the driver’s workstation as a mobile ofﬁce for work or a media
platform for entertainment, autonomous driving also allows the travel time to be used for
relaxation or communicating with fellow passengers. Accordingly, for vehicles with this
use case, the seating concept is expected to accommodate the respective requirements,
although a lot of it is already implemented in current vehicles, even if not for the driver’s
seat.
13.3
Autonomous Valet Parking
Autonomous valet parking can help to solve the parking space problem for private car
owners in residential areas or at workplaces and, for car-sharing users, can bridge the gap
between the car-sharing parking position and the desired point of entry or exit (Chap. 18).
Apart from this feature, the vehicle is a completely “normal” vehicle, which provides the
existing capabilities for assisted, partially or highly automated driving.
When there are no occupants or objects in a vehicle, it is possible to use the free space
in the vehicle with a variable body concept. Concepts with this function already exist
13
Effects of Autonomous Driving on the Vehicle Concept
261
today, enabling the dimensions of a vehicle to be reduced during parking. However, the
authors are not aware of any use in series production, probably because the requirements
for high passive safety clash with the requirements for a variable body. Although
autonomous valet parking is advantageous for this type of space-saving due to lower
parking rates, at the same time it reduces pressure on making the most of the space
available, since the route to a large parking space is now tackled without cost or
time-pressure. It is difﬁcult to predict whether the fuel consumption for the route to the
parking space ends up being more than for searching for a parking space.
Otherwise, autonomous valet parking does not result in any other fundamental degrees
of freedom for the vehicle concept.
13.4
Vehicle-on-Demand
The vehicle-on-demand use case refers to a completely driver-less vehicle which does not
have a driver’s workplace and cannot fall back on the driver’s capabilities. This results in
new degrees of freedom for the design of these vehicles. The following describes these for
this use case. Since this concept favors use over ownership, it can be assumed that in most
cases the user neither owns nor has ownership responsibility for the vehicle. Instead,
service providers make these vehicles available for mobility services (Chap. 18).
13.4.1 Effects on the Body Design
For the use case with driving speeds of up to 120 km/h, which covers almost all areas of
use, the vehicle body must provide the occupants with weather and impact protection in
line with that of current vehicles. This is associated with considerable design restrictions.
A closed passenger compartment, possibly with a convertible roof, is required for
weather-protection reasons. A safe shell with restraints must also be planned for the
passengers in order to guarantee the same passive safety as in current vehicles, with seat
belts and airbags. This requirement will exist for as long as it is not possible to ensure
accident-free operation in road trafﬁc, which is currently not conceivable, at least in mixed
trafﬁc with driver-only vehicles. The vehicle shape may correspond to that of current
vehicles depending on the purpose and target group, with a large range of variants
possible. One-box cars provide the best space economy. Like a cuboid, they are not
lowered at the front or rear of the vehicle. Of course, designers will also make an effort to
present the selected shape to appeal to the customers. However, with the wide range of
possible uses for a vehicle-on-demand concept, the styling target is still largely unclear,
especially to what extent individual emotions will be catered to. A look at the history of
road vehicles shows that there are examples for almost every body design that are
regarded as aesthetically successful or unsuccessful. As a result, it is not possible to
predict a trend from the shape alone. However, all vehicles that include speeds higher than
262
H. Winner and W. Wachenfeld
the 120 km/h speciﬁed here will have aerodynamic state-of-the art shapes, meaning that
they will have curves and aerodynamic tapers and air ﬂow break-away edges [10].
As well as its protective function, the shell around the passengers is also responsible for
connecting the passengers with the environment. In principle, full decoupling is possible
as there is no need to guarantee that the driver can see. This enables private use of the
cabin for entertainment and relaxation, virtually free from visual and acoustic distur-
bances. However, the inﬂuence of driving dynamics can only be insulated to a certain
extent, as described in Sects. 13.2.3 and 13.4.3. There will always be the challenge of
guaranteeing that the impressions of the different senses correspond, as otherwise this
results in discomfort or even sickness, which is unlikely to result in insulation concepts of
this type being accepted. Figure 13.5 shows what a complete decoupling during the
journey would look like on public roads.
The range of alternative activities made possible by this decoupling is large and ranges
from reading in a relaxing “environment” (right-hand vehicle) to exciting entertainment
on racing tracks (left-hand vehicle). The challenge of guaranteeing that the impressions of
the different senses correspond also applies to the artiﬁcial representation of the envi-
ronment. The option of selecting the degree of decoupling using manually operated covers
(blinds) in the simple case to high-tech solutions such as electro-chromic windows deﬁ-
nitely makes it easier to reach a compromise. A virtual connection with the environment in
the form of live camera images of the environment which can be shown (on screens, as a
projection) is also conceivable, but requires a very high level of passenger trust in the
Fig. 13.5 Decoupling the passengers from the real road traffic. Image rights: copyright by the

263
reliability of the technology. Traveling in an autonomous vehicle should not be associated
with the fear of being exposed to an insulation cell without contact with the environment,
even temporarily. A compromise between the virtual and real world is the provision of
information about the environment in the form of an “augmented reality”, in which
information about landmarks is shown as they are seen, for example.
13.4.2 Effects on the Drive Concept
It is not possible to derive any restrictions for the drive from the use case alone. Both
classic combustion engines and electric drives as well as mixed forms (hybrids) are
fundamentally
suitable.
Their
advantages
and
disadvantages
also
apply
for
vehicle-on-demand. On the one hand, there are the storage and charging advantages of
chemical energy that allow the vehicles powered by combustion engines to have a larger
range, and on the other hand, the noise and pollutant emissions advantages of electric
drives which are particularly valued in areas with a high population density. It must be
ensured that there is enough energy on board for the intended trip for vehicle-on-demand.
Therefore, a supply concept where a vehicle charges during time spent stationary is
assumed. Suitable service points will offer this service both manually and automated,
whether at conventional fuel ﬁlling stations or special electric charging stations. Inductive
battery charging is particularly suitable here. Depending on how much the vehicle is used,
the disadvantage of higher charging times for electric vehicles has varying impacts: If the
stationary times are still higher than the traveling times, the charging times are generally
part of the non-use time and therefore do not represent a high economic strain. This is
different when the vehicles are intended for use almost around the clock. When this is the
objective, the time required for energy provision is of considerable consequence, since
charging the batteries results in a signiﬁcantly larger drop in use than refueling vehicles
powered by combustion engines.
(Hydrogen) fuel cell drives will be easier to implement with vehicle-on-demand con-
cepts since a service provider—possibly even in association with other providers—can
integrate the tank infrastructure into the process better than standard vehicle users. This
means that parking spaces (= disposition points) and hydrogen ﬁlling stations can be
coordinated, both with respect to the location and the process. The routes can also be
designed based on the connection between the hydrogen ﬁlling stations from the start if
one ﬁlling is not sufﬁcient for the mobility service. Additionally, unavoidable evaporation
losses that occur with hydrogen pressure tanks when stationary can be minimized to a
large extent since the time spent stationary should be very low for vehicle-on-demand
with economical operation. Despite the advantages of the vehicle-on-demand concept for
(hydrogen) fuel cell technology, both channels, i.e. vehicle-on-demand and hydrogen
drives need to achieve access to the market independently of one another. (Forced)
coupling of the technologies for the market launch only reduces the prospects for both,
264
H. Winner and W. Wachenfeld
since it results in only a fragment of the use options and therefore a limited market volume
which is too small to justify the investment for both technologies.
13.4.3 Effects on the Chassis
Force transfer for vehicle-on-demand will continue to be the responsibility of the tires,
since neither the advantages nor the disadvantages of alternative concepts (e.g. air
cushions/propellers, magnetic levitation drive, chains) are signiﬁcantly affected by vehicle
automation. The driving dynamics requirements are also only going to change minimally,
and the requirement of a particularly sporty chassis is unlikely to be included in the
requirements speciﬁcation for a vehicle-on-demand. The deceleration and evasion capa-
bility (i.e. acceleration of up to ≈10 m/s2) will barely be lower than on current vehicles,
even if a considerably more comfortable vehicle guidance is to be expected. However,
with vehicle-on-demand, it is possible to plan the maneuver predictively in advance and
thereby make the most of the opportunities provided by the existing driving dynamics,
which could result in new opportunities for the chassis design.
As well as the two aspects discussed in the following sections, wheel layout and steering
concepts, the same considerations regarding decoupling from the driving dynamics as
described in Sect. 13.2.3 apply. This is particularly true for vehicle-on-demand vehicles
with the purpose of transporting persons on longer journeys. Although decoupling the
human driver from the driving dynamics and the environment requires a huge amount of
technical effort, it would enable better correspondence of the different sense impressions
than if only one part of the impressions were to be decoupled. A corresponding decoupling
would also be useful for transporting sensitive goods.
13.4.3.1
Possible Wheel Concepts for Vehicle-on-Demand
If we consider the stabilization task for a human driver, vehicle-on-demand makes it
possible to select a wheel concept without taking currently applicable requirements into
account. This degree of freedom motivates existing concepts with fewer than four wheels
to be reassessed for use as vehicle-on-demand.
As proven by motorbikes and three-wheelers, vehicles with fewer than four wheels are
also suitable for transportation. In principle, one wheel alone is sufﬁcient for movement,
as unicyclists impressively demonstrate. Regulating the position of the center of gravity is
the most important role here. A mechatronic system could take on the task of stabilization,
enabling just about anyone to ride and control a one-wheeled vehicle. Two methods can
be used here: Torque generation on the wheel and displacement of movable masses.
The ﬁrst of these concepts is used on the two-wheeled SEGWAY® personal trans-
porters [11]. “Weight shifting” via feet is sensed and the passenger angle is adjusted to suit
the acceleration so that the resulting vector of gravity and inertial force always passes
through the line connecting the wheel contact points. The same method is used for
maneuvering with two wheels one in front of the other. A steering movement in the
13

opposite direction to the direction of the corner results in a rolling moment which gen-
erates an angle which guides the resulting vector of centrifugal force and gravity through
the line connecting the two wheel contact points. In principle, a ball drive could carry out
this stabilization for both directions. However, it is still highly questionable whether
implementation of this kind of stabilization is useful in the context of autonomous driving.
The user is always strongly incorporated with the weight support. Furthermore, these
concepts are restricted to low speeds since vertical unevenness such as curb levels or
potholes overburden both the control dynamics and the actuator capacity and therefore
cannot prevent crashes. This consideration also applies to single-axle two-wheelers such
as the SEGWAY PT mentioned above. These vertical obstacles are not a problem for
motorbikes in transverse movement, even if phenomena such as kick-back reveal the
sensitivity of vehicle stabilization of two-wheelers.
In the same way as tightrope walkers use their arms to balance, in the second concept, a
mass is displaced in such a way that the center of gravity is moved to suit the longitudinal
or lateral forces without any help from the occupants. To stabilize this displacement,
torque is brieﬂy applied to the wheels. The SEGWAY P.U.M.A. (Personal Urban
Mobility and Accessibility) concepts [12] and the implementation by General Motors as
an EN-V (Electric Networked-Vehicle) [13] are used in connection with autonomous
driving. The good maneuverability (turning on the spot) and lower space requirement
mean that this vehicle is well suited to urban use, and this is, of course, not only restricted
to autonomous driving. The disadvantages are the permanent stabilizing effort which
“consumes” a larger share of the energy on board and the sensitivity to vertical levels
speciﬁed above, although the design results in this being less than expected since the
movable mass can reduce the drive torque required for correction here. According to
statements to date, the maximum speed is planned to be 25 miles an hour, or 40 km/h.
This concept is hardly suitable for use up to 120 km/h.
Movable masses can also be used for the classic single-track two-wheeled layout,
although it is more difﬁcult to satisfy the space requirement for the displacement option in
the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction for a single-axle two-wheeled
vehicle. For this reason, a steering actuator that can carry out balancing seems more
promising for autonomous motorbike guidance. However, it remains questionable whether
a concept like this can comply with the mobility requirements for a vehicle-on-demand.
Full enclosure is cumbersome and signiﬁcantly increases side wind sensitivity. However, it
should not be ruled out as, in addition to weather protection, an enclosed frame also
considerably improves safety, as shown by the BMW C1 scooter produced from 2000 to
2003 [14]. Equipped in this way, a single-track two-wheeled vehicle-on-demand is con-
ceivable, possibly including stabilizers for very low speeds and when stationary. However,
whether the special mobility of single-track vehicles, such as passing queues of trafﬁc, can
be implemented with autonomous driving is another question.
The two approaches have an opportunity in common: They can both provide force-free
driving in one direction. On the single-axle two-wheeled vehicle, the longitudinal force on
the occupants can be fully compensated for, and on the single-track two-wheeled vehicle
266
H. Winner and W. Wachenfeld
the same applies for the transverse force. It is an open question whether a passenger
experiencing the trip as a passive occupant ﬁnds this to be pleasant.
With three or more wheels, a vehicle is stable without control as long as the force
vector resulting from inertial force and gravity does not leave the area between the
connection lines surrounding the wheel contact points. Depending on the height of the
center of gravity hs and the driving dynamics limits to be taken into account due to the
maximum friction coefﬁcient lmax; the area of the resulting vector with the road surface is
a circle with radius rres ¼ hS  amax=g ¼ hS  lmax around the central point, see Fig. 13.6.
The central point is the result of projecting the center of gravity in the x–y area of the road
surface. The driving dynamics limits result from the (absolute value of) maximum lon-
gitudinal and transverse acceleration in relation to gravity acceleration g (assumed to be
the same for both directions here amax=g). If the outer connection lines of the wheel
contact points intersect this circle, there is a danger of rolling over. If they are outside of
the circle, it is still possible that the vehicle may roll over in unfavorable conditions, as
proven by the well-known example of the ﬁrst Mercedes-Benz A-Class (further details are
available in [15]).
The minimum footprint area required to resist rolling over on a three-wheeled vehicle,
determined by the wheel contact points, is AFP;3 ¼ 3

res and thereby approximately
30 % larger than the quadratic area. More problematic is the 50 % larger minimum width
of a three-wheeled vehicle, which unlike in Fig. 13.6 is based on two corner points in the
longitudinal direction (otherwise 73 % larger width in the position shown). For this
reason, a three-wheeled vehicle with purely static support will be unlikely to be used for
automated driving.

A hybrid chassis solution with a footprint that is too small for static support makes it
possible to displace the center of gravity so that the circle drawn in Fig. 13.6 is displaced
in relation to the chassis, e.g. moves to the left in a left-hand bend. The displacement can
be represented using a translational movement or a rotational movement. The Piaggio
MP3 three-wheeled scooter design is an example of the latter [16] with two front wheels
and parallelogram kinematics enabling an angle for the complete scooter structure. As a
result, this vehicle has a restricted static tilting stability, however it does not require
permanent control for constant conditions, e.g. for driving on straight roads. This type of
concept would deﬁnitely be an option for vehicle-on-demand in conjunction with the
enclosure mentioned above and a protective frame, if the transport requirement is to
transport one, or maybe even two people.
Similarly, a third wheel can also complement a single-axle concept such as the EN-V
mentioned already. Here, a wheel afﬁxed in front of or behind the main axle is responsible
for static support. However, the retention of rotation while stationary requires that the
additional wheel can be steered. Four-wheel designs with a footprint that is too small to
resist rolling over are conceivable. An example of this is the Nissan Land Glider study
[17], a vehicle with a width of 1.10 m which can assume a lateral angle of up to 17°.
Whether this still relatively large width compared to a scooter is accompanied by the
advantages for a vehicle-on-demand compared to a standard vehicle of normal width
without tilt technology is disputable. The ability to compensate for the transverse force on
the occupants using tilt technology could be a plus point in its own right. As well as tilting
systems, adaptive chassis with a variable track width or a variable wheelbase and variable
center of gravity height could fundamentally also result in resistance to rolling over as
required [18].
13.4.3.2
Steering Concepts
Currently, axle pivot steering on the front axle is dominant, and there is little reason to not
use this for vehicle-on-demand too. However, the status of alternative steering concepts
could be enhanced by autonomous driving. These include steering by forces like a skid
steer, which can range from different forces to different force directions on one axle, e.g. a
negative driving force on the left and a positive driving force on the right for turning to the
left. This concept is the method of choice for the single-axle two-wheeled vehicle. The
steering by forces results in considerable restrictions for three or four-wheeled vehicles if
there is not at least one additional rotational degree of freedom for the wheels to support
steering control.
Alternatively, multi-axle steering is possible, often referred to as four-wheel or
all-wheel steering. Although this is known of in vehicle technology, there are only very
few vehicles available with it. Use is restricted due to the compromise design of current
all-wheel steering vehicles which vehicle developers have to carry out. The driver cannot
access the rear wheel steering. It is coupled (electronically) to the front wheel steering.
268
H. Winner and W. Wachenfeld
In a trade-off, it currently supports the vehicle agility at lower speeds (≲100 km/h) with
inverse steering angles and the stability at higher speeds (≳100 km/h) with concordant
steering angles. Steering corrections are also carried out in the critical limits of driving
dynamics. Autonomous trajectory planning could use this degree of freedom indepen-
dently of the speed and in accordance with the planned maneuver. This would make it
possible to change lanes without yawing, i.e. without rotation around the vertical axis,
allowing the repercussion on the passengers to be reduced. When parking, maneuvers are
possible that are not possible with all-wheel steering as in a standard set-up, far less with
standard front-axle steering.
An extreme solution would be all-wheel steering that controls each wheel individually.
This would be able to position all the wheels in an optimum angle but which requires
more complicated actuator systems. There is little advantage for the application as a
vehicle on-demand. It is restricted to a displacement of driving dynamics limits of a few
percent, principally relevant for racing and a reduction in cornering resistance due to
restriction-free wheel control.
13.4.4 Effects on the Vehicle Interior and Human–Machine
Interface
If the vehicle on-demand is used to transport passengers, the possibilities speciﬁed in
Table 13.1 are available for the type, direction and positioning of passenger accommo-
dation. There is fundamentally no reason not to continue with the current usual posi-
tioning of seats in front of and beside each other, facing forwards. If occupant protection
allows it, it is possible to deviate from this, and the fully reclined position in particular
should be offered for relaxation, although the direction remains open, e.g. as a row of seats
in the transverse direction or as a reclining seat in the longitudinal direction.
As the occupants are not expected to take on any driving tasks, the interface is
essentially restricted to entering the destination, occupant information and a safe-exit
switch which causes the vehicle to stop at the next safe point. The ﬁrst two could even be
separated from the vehicle and could be implemented using a personal device similar to
today’s smartphones. Advanced interactions are to be expected for controlling the
ambiance (e.g. closing the (electronic) blinds) and any entertainment programs.

13.5
Use Case Overall View
Autonomous driving varies less by vehicle concept than by the use of driving time. With
the current statistical vehicle occupation of 1.5 persons [19], the majority of these persons
cannot make use of the options available to passengers today, such as reading, working or
sleeping, see Fig. 13.7. Autonomous driving makes this possible. Additionally, activities
are possible which would currently result in impermissible distraction of the driver, e.g.
from multimedia entertainment on a large screen and surround sound to what is referred to
as 4D cinema.
There is a further change to the user group. Previously, a driver with driving autho-
rization was always required. With vehicle-on-demand, this restriction no longer applies,
meaning that new users who could currently only be passengers in the vehicle can use the
autonomous vehicles. These could be people who are not permitted to drive due to
physical disabilities (e.g. visual impairment) or persons who are not able to drive due to
mental health issues or simply groups such as children and young people who are not
permitted to drive due to their age. Accordingly, the vehicle and the operational concept
must also be adapted for these users. First, it is necessary to deﬁne the requirements as to
what authority the occupants have over what happens in the vehicle and on the driving.

Changes that Go Beyond the Vehicle
If the focus so far was on the individual vehicles, the system boundary is expanded in this
section to include interaction with the environment and other road users. The intercon-
nectivity of vehicles will be established as technology for all (new) vehicles early on,
meaning that the introduction of autonomous driving does not result in anything funda-
mentally new. However, automation of vehicles also increases their performance capa-
bility, making new forms of use possible. The higher level of precision expected in
autonomous vehicles means that electronically controlled maneuvers are possible which
would scarcely be conceivable in this form in current trafﬁc. These opportunities include
convoy driving with very small distances between the vehicles or driving in particularly
narrow driving lanes. The impact on the ﬂow of trafﬁc can be seen clearly in Fig. 13.8.
The number of trafﬁc elements that cross the depicted trafﬁc area per time unit increases. If
this is coupled with the corresponding pre-emptions, this can boost autonomous driving.
Depending on the speciﬁcations associated with these pre-emptions, the vehicle concept
may also change, and even the appearance may change with these speciﬁcations. The
extent to which a regulation like this can affect the vehicle concept can be seen in the
restriction of the overall vehicle length of trucks in the EU. As a result, all tractive vehicles
in Europe are equipped with a sheer, space-saving vehicle front, while vehicles in North

271
America that are not subject to this restriction have an aerodynamic hood extending
forwards.
Mass transfer during the journey is conceivable, if still very unusual from today’s
perspective. This is already implemented in agriculture (e.g. unloading crops while
reaping) and in aviation in the form of refueling while still in the air. This could save time
and space when transporting goods or passengers. Accordingly, suitable transition areas
would have to be included in the vehicle design. This principle is illustrated in Fig. 13.8.
A long-distance vehicle similar to a truck transfers goods to the smaller “distributor
vehicle” during the journey. Automation means that the journey is synchronized precisely
and a bridge-like construction makes it possible to exchange goods. This means that
completely new logistics and mobility concepts can be developed. However, without
discussing the overall system, designing a vehicle does not make much sense, which is
why this is not covered in more detail here.
13.7
Follow-Up Concepts
While the use cases examined throughout have the potential to help with the breakthrough
of the technologies required for autonomous driving, a number of applications that alone
would not be sufﬁcient to help a technology to reach the required maturity would beneﬁt
from this. This would mean that roadworthy service robots would be an option, for
example to clean roads, cycle lanes and pavements and move independently from one job
site to the next using public roads. Other transport and utility vehicles that were formerly
restricted to depots could now leave them, or, in other words: Depots are expanded to
public grounds.
This eliminates the boundaries that were placed on autonomous systems to date, both
with respect to scaling (from household robot to walking frame and cleaning robot, to post
delivery vehicle and patient transportation) and relating to the private, public and com-
mercial areas in which they are implemented. These concepts would have a big impact on
the world of work and could reduce the number of people employed in the mobility sector
in a wave of rationalization. This use case, following the vehicle-on-demand concept, has
the potential to considerably reduce the number of professional driver jobs in particular.
As well as the world of work, these vehicles could also revolutionize access to goods in
particular, since it would be possible to automate the path from request for goods to the
physical delivery (Chap. 16). Pilot projects with multi-copter “drones” are already
sketching out this path for light goods. The unbeatable energy efﬁciency advantages of
wheeled vehicles means that the demand for autonomous wheeled vehicles for the
delivery of heavy goods is sure to come.
272
H. Winner and W. Wachenfeld
13.8
Summary
In summary, the following three main points can be identiﬁed for concept changes after
analyzing the four use cases:
With autonomous driving, no-one is bound to the task of driving for the duration of the
trip. This results in freedom as to how to use this time. The different uses will have a
considerable impact on the vehicle interior and the design of the human–machine
interface.
Not having to take on the task of driving means that a change in the connection to the
environment is possible. This applies both to the haptic channel for decoupling the effect
of force from the road surface and driving dynamics on the passengers and to the visual
decoupling. However, there are reservations here due to possible conﬂicts between visual
and vestibular perception as can be observed in driving simulators today. This can only be
solved by completely decoupling both worlds, i.e. when there is no visual impression from
the outside and no force affecting the passengers. This would not only be very compli-
cated to achieve for the chassis, but might also be alarming for passengers.
Since autonomous driving is always carried out by means of by-wire actuator control, a
very high level of motion control accuracy can be assumed. On the one hand, this enables
new steering concepts, possibly even connected with anti-roll over devices on vehicles
with a footprint that is not sufﬁcient for resistance to rolling over alone, especially if
steering by humans is no longer planned. On the other hand, this precision enables
connection to other autonomous vehicles with the same level of precision in order to better
utilize the infrastructure or to enable concepts that still seem very unusual today, such as
car-to-car mass transfer.
13.9
Will Autonomous Driving Revolutionize Vehicle
Concepts?
Automation will not instigate a revolution in vehicle concepts. Although some concepts
are less “disadvantaged” by automation, classic vehicle concepts such as four-wheel
passenger cars are expected to continue to dominate in the world of automated road trafﬁc.
However, new opportunities arise for special niche use areas, only the appeal of these
niches is driven more by the speciﬁc regulations and access restrictions than by the
superiority of the concept for general individual motorized trafﬁc.
As is already the case today, it will be the use that determines the concept for
autonomous vehicles, and using the gained travel time will stimulate vehicle interior
designs in particular.
Automated driving technology may well result in even more differentiation in the
market than today:
On the one hand, there will be expensive, comfort-based high-tech vehicles resembling
sedan chairs that serve as a moving living room, ofﬁce or bedroom.
13
Effects of Autonomous Driving on the Vehicle Concept
273
On the other hand, low-cost utility vehicles will be used that have the equipment
required for transport services but which resemble small city buses and are neither
emotionally attractive nor especially comfortable.
The technology developed for the use cases speciﬁed above will result in lots of
spin-off applications that may signiﬁcantly change the service sector.

Implementation of an Automated
Mobility-on-Demand System

Introduction
There is currently much discussion, development and research, both in expert circles and
in the public sphere, concerning automated (or often “autonomous”) vehicles. Within this
discourse, personally used vehicles assume a central position, that is to say, focus is
geared toward increasing vehicle automation on city streets and highways. While the
vision of automated passenger vehicles operating with no human intervention still seems a
long way off, there are already examples where, either today or in the very near future,
self-driving vehicles are or will be deployed in public transportation. The past few decades
have given rise to successful railroad systems requiring no operating staff, and now the rail
as a guidance medium is being replaced on our streets by satellite navigation and obstacle
detection systems, which allow for an automated journey to the user’s destination of
choice.
A wealth of experience can already be derived from such automated transportation sys-
tems to be applied in the future to the development of highly automated passenger vehicles,
even if these transportation systems are frequently only operated in limited areas, such as
downtown centers. The operational, user-speciﬁc, insurance-related or liability-based con-
cerns for slow-moving, geographically limited vehicles are in many cases similar to those for
the vehicles driven on highways. As such, there is a hope that the automated
mobility-on-demand (AMOD) systems described here can, despite diverging objectives

when set against highly automated sedans or SUVs, highlight a number of synergies, thus
pointing the way forward for the deployment of the latter on public roads. This contribution
will report on the implementation of such a transportation system at Stanford University in
California. The goal of this report is to detail the ﬁndings and assist in future implementation
of other automated vehicles.
14.2
Definition and Scope
This contribution primarily deals with “automated mobility on-demand systems”, or
AMOD for short, and the respective vehicles that make up these systems. The term
“automated” should be understood here in the context of vehicle automation, whereby
computer systems are integrated into road vehicles in such a way that persons are relieved
from the task of driving the vehicle. In the example dealt with in this report, driving tasks,
which comprises “navigation”, “lane keeping” and “stabilization”, are performed in their
entirety by computer systems. A driver is thus no longer necessary. In some cases even, no
persons (i.e. passengers) are present in the vehicle at all. A vehicle may, for example,
undertake an unladen journey for logistical purposes. This automation level is also termed
“full automation”, in accordance with the deﬁnition provided by SAE J3016 [1].
The term “on-demand” denotes a transportation system that can be scheduled by the
user for individual use (compare Chap. 2). This can be done via smartphone app, for
example, whereby the user can summon the vehicle to his current location. This works in
much the same way a taxi does, but with the notable difference that these vehicles do not
require drivers. The term “transportation system” here denotes the aggregate system
comprising several vehicles and a central infrastructure, which coordinates the vehicles for
customer use.
The considerations presented in the following report relate to a mobility system in a
urban area, i.e. a developed area with a high population density. This consists of roads,
parking lots, bike lanes, sidewalks, pedestrian zones and buildings, where the trans-
portation system will operate for the purposes of passenger transportation. The size of the
urban area is less important here than the urban-structural characteristics—in other words,
it is not of particular signiﬁcance whether the area in question is a so-called “megacity” or
simply a central area of a mid- or even small-size city. The transportation systems dis-
cussed here are considered as a general service in places where public transportation or
personal automobiles do not represent an optimal solution for user mobility needs.

Description of an AMOD System
This contribution describes a concrete example of an AMOD system, namely the Navia, a
vehicle produced by the French company Induct [2]. Between July 2013 and February
2014, this vehicle was made available to researchers at Stanford University for assessment
278

purposes, meaning that from 2013 onwards, an operating design could be created for a
transportation service with this vehicle. The empirical ﬁndings were documented and are
the subject of the report that follows. Vehicles such as the Navia are highly indicative of
general industry trends in automated system design [3–6]. But it is important to clearly
emphasize, that the particular attention paid to the Navia here in no way represents a
preference for, or endorsement of, that system over others. The company Induct also had
no inﬂuence on the descriptions or ﬁndings discussed in this report. This means that while
the following information is based on experiential knowledge derived from an analysis of
the Induct Navia at Stanford University, it is also generally applicable in scientiﬁc and
transportation-planning terms, as relates to AMOD systems. The information can thus
provide a point of reference for the implementation of future systems.
14.3.1 Technical Design
The AMOD system discussed in this contribution makes use of vehicles equipped with
satellite
navigation
systems,
lasers,
cameras,
ultrasound
and
steering-angle
and
wheel-angle sensors. These sensors and systems determine and monitor the vehicle’s
position and environment. While satellite navigation already allows for a high precision
localization of the vehicle (even on a centimeter level, in cases where additional corrective
methods are used), the vehicles considered here in addition utilize a process known as
“Simultaneous Localization and Mapping” (SLAM).
For this process, the vehicle is guided by operating personnel within a planned oper-
ating area, while the coordinates from the satellite navigation system and the data retrieved
from the laser, camera and (if necessary) ultrasound systems are recorded. A digital map
of the operating area, which unlike conventional maps is a three-dimensional represen-
tation, is created from this data. This representation describes the stationary situation in
the operating area. In other words, all variations, as measured against the saved data in
subsequent vehicle operation, are classiﬁed as movable or “new” obstacles. Such varia-
tions warrant special attention and may necessitate a deviation from the pre-programmed
route.
SLAM technology here represents a “virtual railway line”, whereby physical tracks are
replaced by satellite navigation, which, in connection with environment perception, is
used as a reference system. Deviations between the saved representation and the con-
tinuously updated environment perception data are classiﬁed as obstacles, which may
necessitate a change of route or road. Here, the laser sensors serve mainly as a means of
detecting objects (e.g. persons, vehicles, buildings, obstacles) at medium-to-long-range
distances ranging from approximately 1 up to 200 m from the vehicle. The ultrasound
sensors are used for object detection at close range (less than 2 m from the vehicle). In
addition, the camera systems provide extra information about the shape and type of
detected object (e.g. person or plant), to provide the most detailed possible image based on
object type, distance, direction and, in some cases, speed.
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
279
Variations from the reference system, i.e. obstacles on the planned route, are
acknowledged by the vehicle’s control unit and the actual route can be updated in line
with a series of assessment criteria. In other words, an optimal route and pathway is
calculated and created in accordance with the speciﬁed destination and the given trafﬁc
situation and environment. Even if no path seems accessible at a given moment—for
example if the vehicle sensors detect that an obstacle cannot be bypassed and there is no
alternative route—the vehicle interrupts its journey until the obstacle is removed.
Driving commands are sent from the path-planning unit to the electriﬁed steering,
braking, and drive systems and are then executed. The vehicle features electronic inter-
faces for these components, so that the central control unit can relay steering, braking and
drive commands, with the result that the vehicle executes the journey independently,
depending on the combination of environmental perception, information processing and
destination input (see Fig. 14.1). In doing so, each axle is powered by a brushless
48 V/8 kW electric motor. The vehicle features independent steering on the front and rear
axles. The vehicle’s maximum speed is 40 km/h but is limited to 20 km/h for initial
operation and can, if necessary, be further reduced via parameterization. The turning
diameter is 3.5 m.
The vehicle user has several options in terms of inﬂuencing vehicle operation. The
vehicle can be requested via an input screen at a ﬁxed station whereby for typical oper-
ation the command will be sent using a smartphone app. Once the vehicle arrives at the
requested pick-up location, it stops at which point the parking brake is activated and the
door (in this case an open steel frame structure) is opened so that the passenger or
passengers can safely enter the vehicle. The user then enters the desired destination via the
installed input screen. The vehicle door closes and the parking brake is released so that
the vehicle can start the journey. At all times, passengers have the possibility of stopping

the vehicle immediately using an emergency switch. In such instances, the vehicle
occupants can also contact operating personnel using a vehicle communication system in
order to request help or to communicate other concerns. Because the connection is
radio-based, the operating personnel can be situated at a location completely independent
of the operating area.
As shown in Fig. 14.2, the vehicle is characterized by its extremely open design. There
are no body panels above waist-height (of the passenger) but rather four support pillar for
the canopy roof. In addition, there are no seats in the vehicle. Passengers instead lean
against upholstered supports. The vehicle has space for up to 8 persons and can carry a
maximum weight of 800 kg. It measures 3.5 m × 2.0 m × 2.5 m (length × breadth × height).
The power supply has an estimated operating time of 8 h using a chemical battery, or of
20 min using a supercapacitor. The vehicle can be charged either outside its operating hours
by means of a cable connection or during short breaks by means of a wireless charging
station. The wireless charging option is particularly advantageous for the driverless oper-
ating model since the vehicles are then capable of driving to the charging station themselves
without the need for personnel who would otherwise need to plug in a charging cable. In
case of the operations at Stanford University, the cable-charging process has been used as an
initial solution because of its simplicity for test operation with on-site operating personnel.
14.3.2 Operation
Despite the largely independent operating characteristics of an AMOD system, there are
several special conditions that warrant consideration. Firstly, operating personnel are
required to safeguard operation. While it is not necessary for staff to oversee every
individual steering, braking or drive command, but they must ensure safety of general
operation within the established operating area (with its geographical limits) and speciﬁed
parameters (e.g. speed or position). To achieve this, operation centers are established
similar to those used for driverless trains or for logistics systems. Those centers are staffed
with comparatively small numbers of personnel who monitor a large number of vehicles.
Fig. 14.2 Open design of the
Induct Navia [2]
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
281
The operating center is connected via radio to the individual vehicles and is capable of
monitoring vehicle operating data, halting the vehicle in an emergency and communi-
cating with passengers.
A communication system must always be installed in these vehicles for operational
monitoring purposes. This can involve various communication standards, for example a
cellular or WiFi network. It is essential in both cases that the latency and availability for
the data transfer are up to the necessary requirements.
It should be mentioned at this point that, due to continued radio monitoring and the
ever-present vehicle take-over function, the system is not fully-automated in the strictest
sense of the deﬁnition according to SAE J3016 [1]. This standard speciﬁes that there be no
human monitoring or control-takeover, even in exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless,
one must consider, in the case of transportation systems such as the Navia, that no
operating personnel is in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, which means that these
vehicles must be able to deal with an emergency situation independently. This, in turn,
corresponds to full automation as per SAE J3016, while also demonstrating the limitations
of this deﬁnition.
Furthermore, a route network and operating times must be established for system
operation. This entails deﬁning which routes (detailed bounds) can be traveled in which
area (general bounds). A speciﬁc area is chosen after ﬁrst deﬁning which general location
will be best served by the transportation system on the basis of user needs, monitoring
requirements, driving performance, legislation, economic efﬁciency and any other relevant
considerations. In the case of the AMOD systems discussed here, this area could be
limited to a pedestrian zone, a downtown area, or an entire city. In doing so, there must
always be a detailed consideration, which roads or lanes the vehicles are permitted to
travel on.
For ﬂexible operation of the transportation systems described here, it is necessary to
consider that motorized vehicles are not permitted in some areas, for example pedestrian
zones, and that in such cases an appropriate permit must be obtained for these special,
automated, motorized vehicles. Furthermore, if the vehicles are operating in normal road
trafﬁc, it is likely that a special permission for operating an automated vehicle will be
necessary in most jurisdictions. In some legislative territories, for example a number of
states in the USA, relevant legislation is already being developed and implemented.
In terms of operating times, it is important to consider whether the mobility service
should be provided 24 h a day. This would be a logical and advantageous approach thanks
to the minimal personnel requirements and it is likely to satisfy customers. Nevertheless,
there may be a number of limitations, above all ﬁnancial, that make limited operating
hours a more viable option. One possibility is to park the vehicles in a depot overnight so
as to protect them from vandalism. Another would be to offer the mobility service only
when buses or other public transportation services are not running (e.g. at night) so that
the vehicles are parked in a depot during daytime hours.
In all these cases, the geographical and timeframe limitations applied to vehicle
operation are comparatively straightforward and can be implemented by specifying limits
282
S. Beiker
with corresponding operating parameters. This means using digital mapping and also a
restricted schedule to limit operation in accordance with the operator’s speciﬁcations.
In order to ensure that the AMOD system is operated in accordance to the manufac-
turer’s speciﬁcations, there are certain requirements that must be met prior to commis-
sioning, namely system installation, personnel training and personnel certiﬁcation. This
means, more speciﬁcally, that the transportation system must ﬁrst be installed in accor-
dance with the speciﬁed operating parameters. This generally requires an initial period of
manual operation, which has been described in this report. This allows for the creation of a
digital map, which ensures accurate positioning of vehicles during a later stage of auto-
mated operation.
In terms of training, operating personnel must receive training regarding the vehicle’s
general characteristics and speciﬁc operational dynamics, which is to say the system
characteristics, operating conditions, limitations and other relevant characteristics.
Personnel must learn and understand these aspects of the system. In addition, vehicle
operating safety must be checked—in a way similar to airplanes—before every new
operating stage, e.g. at the beginning of a new day of service. Out-of-the-ordinary inci-
dents during operation, for example a deviation from the deﬁned route, must be inves-
tigated and recorded in the system operating log.
These factors demonstrate that although the vehicles in question are automated, a
substantial amount of preparation is necessary before the system can be operated. This
preparation cannot be carried out automatically and requires operating personnel.
Nevertheless, it should be assumed that for the purposes of overall operation of the
transportation system, considerably fewer staff are required in comparison to systems
where each vehicle requires a driver.
14.3.3 Business Model
One of the main reasons for the deployment of AMOD systems is the considerably lower
stafﬁng requirements when compared to operating models with conventional vehicles.
This has an effect on the business model. The manufacturer of the Navia system claims
that the operating costs for public transportation can be reduced by 50 % [7] using its
system. The business model for these systems thus allows for a considerably cheaper
mobility solution when compared to, a taxi service for example, whereby savings are
generated through smaller staff. In comparison, such systems have the advantage over
passenger cars in that the user, relieved of vehicle control duties, can spend the journey
time working or relaxing.
Beyond that, there is no concrete evidence of additional economic advantages, since
on-demand operating models are also possible with conventional human-controlled
vehicles. However, automated vehicles can also run at hours that are generally less
attractive, for example at night when there is maybe only need for one 10-min journey per
hour. In this case, a driver would wait 50 min without revenue generated. In contrast, if an
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
283
automated vehicle is inactive for 50 min, the waiting period is unimportant as long as
overall revenue in this period is sufﬁcient.
Up to now these systems have only been run in pilot operation, for example during
restricted hours on university campuses or in shopping centers [3–5]. Because these types
of operation were primarily intended to showcase the systems, the business model cannot
yet be fully evaluated. It is estimated that commercial operation will commence in 2015,
when the ﬁrst evaluations of the business models and revenue targets of operators and
manufacturers will be possible.
14.4
Lessons Learned from the Implementation
of the Transportation System
The following section aims to provide an overview of the results of implementing Induct’s
“Navia” AMOD system at Stanford University. Due to the fact that, up until mid-2014,
the vehicles in question were only sporadically in operation, the following stands as an
interim report that is to be continued elsewhere, at a later date. Nevertheless, it is still
possible to communicate the ﬁndings of the implementation approach used, with the aim
of helping other researchers and transportation planners in the implementation of similar
systems.
14.4.1 Differentiation Between Evaluation, Testing and Public
Operation
A range of operating phases was considered for the vehicles in this report, in accordance
with the data in Table 14.1. The aim was ﬁrst to classify the transportation system in an

evaluation phase, then to optimize it in a test phase and ﬁnally, to provide public
operation.
To begin with, the study is reliant on general experiential data which must be gathered
from the vehicles themselves, since such a transportation system is still largely uncharted
territory, making a risk assessment difﬁcult. A range of other important questions informs
the research. Importantly, the system described here allows for a highly ﬂexible operating
model to accommodate the applicable requirements. For the initial evaluation, it is
beneﬁcial to have a basic calibration of the vehicle to the desired operating area to allow
for monitoring by on-site staff. To simplify this process, the vehicle should not require a
special infrastructure, but should operate on a largely independent basis once it has been
calibrated.
The test operation phase that follows seeks, in accordance with the objectives of the
Autonomous Systems Laboratory [8], to optimize the geographical and timeframe dis-
tribution of automated, on-demand vehicles. This phase should be as realistic as possible,
whereby system users, despite the test status, should be allowed to behave in a manner
that reﬂects their actual mobility needs. For example their actions should be able to
demonstrate a preference for the shortest possible waiting time and journey time from one
location to another. This phase of operation must also be designed as highly-ﬂexible yet
target-oriented as it pertains to the transportation system discussed here, since the pro-
vided routes and schedules are comparatively easy to program, allowing for efﬁcient
implementation of requirements.
Test operation should then ultimately lead to public system operation, as long as no
further research testing or optimization works are planned. The operational system is thus
implemented in accordance with the results of the test operation. The transportation
system allows for this step-by-step approach for implementation because the operating
area and operating times are very easily set and, since the vehicle speed and overall
distance are minimal, operational monitoring should pose if at all only few problems.
14.4.2 Choosing a Vehicle Concept
In order to fulﬁll the requirements of the test phase operation, a fully-automated vehicle—
that is to say, a driverless vehicle—is necessary. The vehicle must be able to propel itself
within speciﬁed boundaries, while having on-demand functionality for the user. In
addition, open operating system architecture is required for making alterations to the
deployment and distribution of vehicles. It is not essential here for the vehicles themselves
to have an open architectural design: Neither the operating system for the vehicle control
unit nor the environment perception system are part of these research efforts and, as such,
they do not need to be altered.
The “Navia” vehicles provided by Induct and their associated operating system
architecture fulﬁll the applicable requirements. In addition, experiential data was already
available from other projects that implemented this mobility concept [3, 7], which means
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
285
test operation was likely to run smoothly. Furthermore, Induct’s trademark rights relate
primarily to the ﬁeld of environment perception and reference system creation for vehicle
automation. This means that the research presented here does not conﬂict with Induct’s
work but rather complements it because it focuses on the area of general vehicle operation
in order to best fulﬁll mobility demands. It is for these reasons that the Induct Navia
concept was chosen and evaluated for test operation, in accordance with the criteria
described in the sections that follow, as part of the research work of the Autonomous
Systems Laboratory at Stanford University [8].
14.4.3 Risk Assessment and Legal Classification
Placing this project into the context of the existing legal system is a step-by-step process.
Because the vehicles do not initially run in publicly accessible areas (for evaluation
purposes), a number of special rules apply in terms of vehicle operation and operating
liability. These rules were formulated at Stanford University in consultation with the
department for risk assessment and the university legal department. Legal liability is
assigned, for the most part, to the operator of the vehicles in question which, depending on
the operating mode, is the operating personnel in, directly outside or remotely connected
(via radio) to the vehicle. The operation of the vehicles at the university has been
approved but with certain restrictions applied by the internal (i.e. Stanford University)
staff for risk assessment.
The risk assessment for the vehicle operation detailed here is considerably easier to
plan than for equivalent operation in public trafﬁc, primarily because the vehicle speed
and the operating area are greatly limited. That means that, in contrast to conventional
passenger vehicles, which are considerably faster and can, in theory, travel anywhere, a
speed limit of 20 km/h and a signiﬁcantly conﬁned area represent a comparatively small
operating risk. To begin with, system operation in this area was only permitted without
public access and under the direct supervision of operating personnel, directly outside, or
directly inside, the vehicle. These restrictions placed on the ﬁrst stages of operation mean
that all project partners gain an understanding of the capabilities, limitations and any other
characteristics associated with the system. This allows for a step-by-step risk analysis and
legal classiﬁcation process as the test phase operation itself is gradually widened in scope.
This also means that the risk assessment and legal classiﬁcation process cannot be
accurately determined in advance and they are instead based on the practical data of
vehicle behavior as it arises.
With the gradual expansion of the operating model in test and then public operation
(see Table 14.1), public legislation comes increasingly to the fore as the dominant reg-
ulating feature, as long as vehicles are operating on public streets. For this research,
respective regulation in California, USA was applicable. This regulation was still in the
ﬁnal legislative phase during the ﬁrst half of 2014. It is important to note here that, as of
September 2014, only vehicle manufacturers were permitted to perform tests with
286
S. Beiker
“autonomous” (automated or fully-automated) vehicles [9]. Because the deﬁnition of
“vehicle manufacturer” includes a person who modiﬁes a vehicle so it become an
“autonomous” vehicle, it remains to be seen, which roads the vehicles at Stanford will
travel on and who the “manufacturer” is in the sense of the California law. It is assumed,
under this law, that the vehicle manufacturer corresponds to the actual producer from
whom Stanford University procured the vehicles and not the university’s researchers, as
long as said vehicles are not modiﬁed by Stanford University in a way that facilitates their
automation but, rather, their data are assessed and optimized as pertains to position,
temporal behavior and user requirements.
Admittedly the legal situation is currently difﬁcult to predict since it is still in transition.
It is likely, however, that changes will be made on a number of legislative levels (state,
municipal and national) and that measures will have to be taken to comply. But in the
context of the operating area dealt with here, which is to say an innovative university in
California, the fundamental attitude of the responsible authorities and the public toward
automated vehicles seems to be a very positive one. The relevant legal bodies also seem to
be taking a supportive and favorable attitude. There is also a sense of conﬁdence that, in
individual cases, special regulation can be agreed to allow for system operation that may
not be explicitly provided for by law. This type of attitude has also been observed in other
parts of the USA. As such, US legislation does not seem to represent a key barrier to the
introduction of automated vehicles but is more likely to act as an additional reviewing
body.
14.4.4 Contractual Structure
For the purposes of an AMOD, a contract is required that outlines the fundamental legal
relationship between the owner of the vehicle (for the test operation described here: the
manufacturer) and the user (here: Stanford University as the research facility). This entails
rights and obligations pertaining to general use, information and communication, main-
tenance, liability and other provisions for test operation.
In the example dealt with here, a loan agreement for one automated vehicle was agreed
between the manufacturer-owner and the user of the vehicle that, at the outset, was only
applicable for the purposes of the evaluation phase that would potentially lead to a
research project. As soon as a deﬁnite project with an AMOD system is pursued, a new or
possibly supplementary contract would be necessary which would then govern all cir-
cumstances for effective use. Such a contract could also potentially include the possibility
of altering environment perception and route planning technology for research purposes,
which are not included in the evaluation phase.
In the contract between the manufacturer-owner and the user of the vehicles deployed
in this evaluation phase, liability is assigned to the operator. As such, the operator is the
legal entity that initiates and monitors vehicle operation, whereby this could be either the
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
287
operating personnel inside or directly outside the vehicle, or the operating personnel
remotely connected via radio.
14.4.5 Selection of the Operating Area and Operating Scenarios
To begin with, the operating area for the AMOD system must be geographically limited.
For the initial evaluation and subsequent test operation phases, the size of the operating
area is not as a much a point of focus as the range of users, use cases and operating
situations. These factors can be proactively represented for evaluation and test purposes in
trial form—in other words, the project parties envision and design a range of suitable
situations in which vehicle behavior can be observed and assessed. As such, a small
operating area is sufﬁcient for assessing a wide range of situations and operating
conditions.
Because the concept of an AMOD system is a new one and, accordingly, a risk
assessment of the system on the basis of experiential data is somewhat limited, an
operating area must initially be found that ensures realistic operation but also complete
control. This means that users must be in a position to request vehicles within the
operating area, specify a destination and then give vehicle commands—all without the
direct involvement of operating personnel. At the same time, the operating personnel must
be able to monitor the vehicles. They should also have control of, or at least knowledge of,
the persons and vehicles located in the operating area that could potentially interfere with
the vehicles during this initial test operation.
An overview of the number of persons in the operating area is important to allow the
operating personnel to recognize and prevent collisions and other disturbances. For
example, at the beginning of the test phase there should be no person within the vehicle’s
operating area who is not familiar with the transportation system or who would behave in
a way that deviates from any stipulated regulations (e.g. stepping in front of a vehicle). It
must be ensured that all persons involved are familiar with the characteristics and risks of
the transportation system but that these persons also behave in the way a real user would,
in that they request vehicles and set destinations realistically. One possibility here is to
have persons who interact with the vehicle sign a release form, which states that they are
acquainted with the system’s characteristics and limitations and they will adapt their
behavior accordingly.
The operating area is thus heavily limited initially and may, for the reasons described
previously, need to be fenced in and made accessible only with special permission.
Moving forward, operation should then be expanded to an area that is monitored but also
public so that a large number of real users are targeted. This involves bringing in users
who have no prior understanding of the system and who do not sign a special release form
—instead they should seek to use the vehicles as they would a taxi or bus. For this
purpose, it is important that the operating area features users with mobility needs that can
be solved by the vehicles in question, as relates to distance, speed and transport capacity.
288
S. Beiker
A university such as Stanford is capable of implementing such a system and fulﬁlling
the envisioned requirements. The university campus has grounds large enough to
accommodate the Navia. Demand for passenger and goods transportation is high. Also,
trafﬁc issues are dealt with as effectively as possible by the responsible university
department (Parking and Transportation Services). This allows for a suitable area for the
introductory evaluation phase to which only test participants have access. In the following
phase, pedestrian zones and streets can be incorporated. In all cases, the necessary
communication systems for personnel monitoring must be in place, with personnel access
to the vehicles where necessary.
After it became know that Navia vehicles were being used at Stanford University, a
string of university departments registered their interest in using the transportation system.
One query came from the operator of the local bus service, which was looking for a
ﬂexible expansion of its services at certain points. Another interested party was the
university’s utilities and repairs departments, which was looking for a ﬂexible and
unmanned system to transport items around the campus. An additional research facility
also voiced its interest in establishing a passenger transportation system on its research
campus.
Taking into account the enquiries that were received and the system’s capabilities,
operation began on an access-controlled parking lot, with a range of operating scenarios
simulated. A subsequent more realistic trial is planned to take place on the grounds of the
separate research facility, where both a large number of real users are expected and full
monitoring of operations can be ensured.
To begin the evaluation phase, a set of special scenarios must be created that allow for
risk assessment and related safety tests. Here, vehicles can be confronted with obstacles
and other objects. These should be genuine, safety-relevant scenarios in which vehicles
behave in the desired manner, without faults that could lead to critical operating condi-
tions. The objects that stand in the vehicles’ way are pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles of all
kinds, animals and everyday objects that can be found in a normal operating area, such as
trash bins, packages, cartons, working materials, plants, buildings, etc.
Here, a distinction must be made between stationary and movable objects, since the
former can be clearly deﬁned in the digital map of the environment, which allows for the
course of the vehicles to be determined accordingly. Movable objects—in this case objects
that are seldom moved and only as a result of outside interference (e.g. a debris container)
—must be fully captured by the environmental sensors in order to avoid a collision.
Depending on the type of object, operating scenarios should be drawn up along with a
corresponding mode of behavior for the purposes of risk assessments and safety tests:
Persons and vehicles should be able to move in front of the vehicle suddenly—trash bins
and packages should of course, be somewhat slower. When these objects emerge, vehicle
behavior should be designed in such way that it is prompt and reliable enough—on the
basis of its detection processes—to avoid a collision.
14

289
14.4.6 Setting up the Transportation System and Certification
of Personnel
The vehicle manufacturer speciﬁes how the transportation system and its automated
vehicles should be implemented. The ﬁrst step is to establish the route. This route is then
traveled by one of the vehicles in a special operating mode, which allows for a digital map
of the operating area to be created. The operating data is then edited so that stationary and
moving obstacles can be categorized. Finally, the manufacturer creates a document
detailing the mode of use and the operating area. This should detail parameters and zonal
limits, thereby specifying what is permissible within a certain type of operation, taking
into account potential legal liability issues. These guidelines are then documented in a
certiﬁcate produced by the manufacturer.
For the purposes of issuing operating personnel with certiﬁcation, the manufacturer
provides training pertaining to operating requirements, functional characteristics, operat-
ing modes, technical details, limitations, risks, etc. Personnel should acquire an under-
standing of the system based on practical interaction and this understanding should be
tested. The manufacturer documents this certiﬁcation process, thereby certifying those
persons who have successfully completed their training with a detailed knowledge of the
system. There are also three task levels: “supervisor”, “operator” and “technician” which
designate whether operating staff are to only monitor, generally operate, or carry out
maintenance on or modiﬁcations to the system.
The vehicle manufacturer must ﬁrst deﬁne these processes and task scopes, since the
manufacturer is the party with the best knowledge of the system and the risks associated
with the vehicles. So as to be able to incorporate potential peculiarities of the operating
environment into the organization, the operator of the system (which is to say, not the
manufacturer but the responsible monitoring person, either on-site or connected via radio)
should make changes or upgrades in terms of system testing, maintenance and certiﬁca-
tion, since it is here that unique situations become most evident. As time progresses,
similar AMOD systems will be the subject of further upgrades and greater expansion,
providing legislators with more experiential data. This means that, ultimately, the relevant
processes and scopes for the certiﬁcation of vehicles and personnel will likely be created
either by legislative authorities or from commissioned institutions.
14.4.7 System Start-up and Operational Monitoring
For live vehicle operation, the manufacturer speciﬁes a system start-up and a corre-
sponding system inspection. This involves a check of the vehicle and environmental
parameters before approval can be granted for live operation. This process represents a
good compromise between detailed precision and manageability, so that before the
initiation of each operating period there is total certainty that both the transportation
290
S. Beiker
system and the operational environment meet safety and functional requirements in
accordance with the standards for certiﬁed operation.
For vehicle operation with radio monitoring (which involves no operating personnel in
the vicinity of the vehicle) the manufacturer provides a communication system. This
involves the implementation of two independent, wireless communication systems, for
example a cellular and WiFi link or two independent cellular networks. The operating
personnel can use this systems to access vehicle data and, if necessary, execute an
emergency stop or communicate with the passengers in the vehicle. The exact scope of
monitoring, e.g. vehicle position, speed, direction of travel, passenger numbers and door
locking, in addition to full video surveillance of the environment, will be established on an
individual basis and is currently (as of June 2014) not speciﬁed.
Up to now, the vehicles at Stanford University have only been run with operating
personnel in or in the direct vicinity of the vehicle with direct access to an emergency stop
switch. For this reason there is currently no further experiential data available on operation
with a radio monitoring connection. Nevertheless, it has been established, from this
limited experience, that it is more likely that collisions can be traced back to other road
users (pedestrians, cyclists, other vehicles) than to the automated vehicle itself. The
combination of environment perception, object classiﬁcation and route planning is ade-
quate—particularly given the minimal vehicle speed and the familiar and limited opera-
tion area—to allow the vehicle to be operated safely and without disruptions.
For future operation with radio monitoring there will need to be an assessment of the
response time necessary for operating personnel to arrive at the location of the disruption.
For example, road construction or illegally parked vehicles could block the route. In such
situations, vehicles would automatically interrupt their journey and inform the operating
station of the disturbance. Then, depending on the working location of local operating
personnel, a time period will elapse that could amount to minutes or considerably longer,
before personnel are on location to solve the fault. The frame of reference here is elevator
support, whereby activating an emergency button also initiates immediate contact to an
operations center although it can take substantial time until staff reaches the site. It is then
a task within public operation to ascertain how passengers in AMOD systems deal with
such a scenario and whether the waiting time represents a problem for them. It should be
noted that, in contrast to an elevator system, the passengers of this transportation system
have direct contact to the outside environment at all times, thanks to the open structure of
the system (see Fig. 14.2) and they can, in an emergency, leave the vehicle relatively
easily.
14.4.8 Information for Users and Pedestrians
Due to the fact that this AMOD system constitutes a new innovation in the ﬁeld of
personal mobility, users must be informed of the risks and possibilities associated with it.
To begin with, the particulars of normal operation need to be made clear: This means, the
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
291
actual control process itself should be explained. This requires a minimum of detail since
this transportation system will allow for usage similar to a taxi or bus service—and those
services are already completely familiar to future users. Instead, the risks and special
attributes of test operation should be the subject of focus. This includes an explanation of
the system’s limitations and dangers, for example the risk that it does not recognize an
obstacle fast enough or, in some case, vehicle behavior that may be out of the ordinary.
The users for the evaluation and test operation phases are provided with written
information on vehicle characteristics and associated risks. This includes information
explaining whom users should turn to as the person legally liable in the event of damage.
Similarly, once in public operation, users should have the option of giving feedback and
forwarding queries to the operator of the system. And because this is a new transportation
system, user evaluations are of great importance. Therefore it is important that users know
who they can contact to voice their opinions.
Just as with the users of the automated system, it is important that pedestrians and other
road users are provided with information on the operation of the vehicles. Thereby, it is
not absolutely essential to provide them with knowledge on vehicle usage itself. However,
given the level of interaction between vehicles and other road users, the latter must be
informed about the associated eventualities and risks. This particularly includes
right-of-way regulations and other special provisions. Pedestrians and other road users
should know how they could in case of an emergency stop a vehicle from outside using
the emergency stop function. Pedestrians should also be aware of the identity of the
ofﬁcial system operator, who they can turn to and provide feedback or make queries.
14.4.9 Public Response
Even if, up to now, the AMOD system has only been witnessed in public operation on a
conﬁned scale at Stanford University (and this was only the case when the vehicle was
transferred, controlled by operating personnel, from one operating area to another), one
can still make several assertions about the reaction of the public. These observations are
derived from the aforementioned transfers and from visits during the evaluation phase.
Observations could also be made at the vehicle’s depot location. It is important to
emphasize here that the following descriptions do not constitute a methodical study, but
rather incidental observations that aim to provide an impetus for future study. As a general
rule, the public—which is to say, those persons who were exposed to but not involved in
the project—reacted very positively to the vehicle. There are two probable reasons for
this:
Firstly, non-participating pedestrians and observers generally seemed to be very
interested and curious in relation to automated vehicles as a concept. This may be because
such technologies are currently a major theme in both general media and popular science
as well as in scientiﬁc publications. It is above all the general media that frequently
reports, in positive, sometimes even euphoric terms, about “autonomous” vehicles in
292
S. Beiker
which drivers hand over total control to a computer so that they are free to perform other
tasks during their journey. When people encounter this type of vehicle for the ﬁrst time
after being exposed to such media coverage, curiosity, receptiveness and a level of trust
are likely responses.
Secondly, the characteristics of the vehicle in question haven been seen to bring about
spontaneous and positive reactions from pedestrians and observers. The open structure
(see Fig. 14.2) is one of the inﬂuencing factors: The vehicle has open, only low-rise side
panels and an open railing system instead of a closed door. Thanks to this structure, the
vehicle’s passengers are clearly visible to passers-by and this open visibility makes a
positive impression. More speciﬁcally, this means that the visual impression left by the
vehicle is very different to that of a vehicle e.g. with tinted windows and closed doors, in
which case passers-by have no idea who is in the vehicle. This would be comparable to
the differing impressions one would have, in normal public trafﬁc, from a limousine with
tinted windows on the one hand, or an open convertible on the other. In addition, the
vehicle described here features a design concept taken from the boating industry, whereby
epoxy is used for the body, the passenger seats are covered in beige leather, the ﬂoor is
bright teak and the roof is sail-like in shape. Comments from the public ranged from “land
yacht” to “a whirlpool on wheels”—all positive associations that form an initial
impression of the technology.
In addition, the vehicle is comparatively slow and operates at a speed that is barely
above walking pace. This gives passers-by the impression of safety. Pedestrians feel that
they can quickly move to the side if need be. Drivers of automobiles at the same time
likely feel “superior” to the vehicle, which may also be due to the fact that the visible
structure is largely plastic. As a result of these characteristics—which is to say the open
and positive appearance, in addition to the slow speed—observers seem to attribute an
almost personal character to the vehicle, similar to the characters in motion pictures such
as “Short Circuit”, “The Matrix” or “Star Wars”. These movies show that robots are
assigned different characters depending on their appearance, performance and aggres-
siveness. These characteristics and mechanisms should be carefully considered when an
automated vehicle is put into public operation. It seems that the “character” of a vehicle is
an important factor in provoking a positive public reaction towards vehicle automation.
That is to say that an automated vehicle, using a certain mechanism, can be seen either as a
“subordinate servant” or a “ruthless mercenary” (see also the article by Kröger in this
volume Chap. 3).
These interactions with pedestrians and observers have produced a host of questions
about the AMOD system. The most common question is when and where these vehicles
will be useful in the public realm. Other pertinent questions relate to the technical
speciﬁcations of the vehicles. Among these issues is the question of if and how vehicles
will react to objects, very speciﬁcally pedestrians, pets, and stationary objects. Questions
relating to monitoring and legal liability for vehicles have also been raised. These ques-
tions illustrate the general level of public interest in the vehicles and that the public has put
much thought into the issues surrounding the operation and limitations of automated
14
Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
293
vehicles. This also underlines the importance of public awareness and information both
before and during system operation.
14.5
Summary and Outlook
This article describes the ﬁrst steps in implementing an automated mobility-on-demand, or
AMOD, system. This transportation system comprises vehicles that can be summoned via
smartphone app. They serve the purpose of transporting persons within a speciﬁed area,
for example a downtown city area, without either the possibility of directly intervening in
the vehicle’s operation and with no rails or tracks. This mobility concept is operated at
Stanford University for the purposes of a scientiﬁc study in the ﬁeld of innovative
mobility solutions using automated transportation systems, with a view to examining the
initial suitability of the vehicles for this purpose.
The ﬁrst stages of the project involved risk assessment and legal classiﬁcation pro-
cesses. The system operating area and a range of operating scenarios were then estab-
lished. The results showed that the system can be built on the basis of existing regulations
and provisions but that, because of its automated nature, the system entails a number of
requirements that clearly also exceed existing parameters. As such, it is expedient for the
vehicles to drive slowly (a 20 km/h limit) and within a limited operating area.
In addition, operating personnel should be either in the vehicle, directly outside the
vehicle, or remotely connected to the vehicle via radio, so as to facilitate a smooth ﬁrst
implementation of the system. In the context of the necessary internal coordination
requirements and the necessary regulations, it has proved extremely important to
demonstrate the system in real operation to the concerned parties and decision makers, so
as to be able to realistically evaluate the level of operating risk and vehicle capabilities and
limitations. The open and appealing appearance of the vehicles, combined with a great
level of public interest and curiosity, mean that they provoke a positive response among
the public. Consumers also expect that automated vehicles, at some point in the near
future, will relieve them of the often burdensome task of driving in the city.
There are, however, a number of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of auto-
mated vehicles. These include associated infrastructural, economic and business-strategic
variables but also an applicable legal framework. In the example detailed here, the imple-
mentation of the transportation system at Stanford University (which represents a legislative
area within the US State of California), or more speciﬁcally, onthe university’s own grounds,
has proven advantageous, as the university itself can directly stipulate regulations. California
legislation is currently being processed for the operation of automated vehicles, which would
then provide legislative boundaries for system operation in thoroughfares on the periphery of
the campus. One will soon see how legislation for automated vehicles is to be handled and the
system’s operation and design will need to be structured accordingly.
294
S. Beiker
In conclusion, the current outlook is very much positive on the basis of these initial
system trials and the positive public stance on the implementation of automated vehicles,
which is being promoted and encouraged. It is important to note, however, that these
initial impressions do not constitute a representative study—further efforts are required for
implementing and promoting acceptance of automated vehicles. But in summary, there is
hope that automated mobility-on-demand systems will make an important contribution to
the improvement of urban mobility for individuals.

Implementation of an Automated Mobility-on-Demand System
295
Part III
Traffic
There is no doubt that road trafﬁc is the most important mode in terms of transport and
haulage capacity for society and the economy. Upgrading the infrastructure at bottlenecks
on the road network, however, cannot keep pace with the demands for a compatible and
environmentally friendly implementation, neither regarding demand for capacity nor the
required qualities. In light of the limited budgets for building and upgrading transport
infrastructure, only measures with disproportionately high economic beneﬁts for any
implementation will be looked at here. Proposals will thus only be urgently pursued when
their beneﬁts exceed the costs threefold, for example in federal road planning
(Bundesverkehrswegeplanung).
Besides tight budgets, the boundary conditions of urban construction and regional
planning are limiting factors for the further upgrading of transport infrastructure. An
extension to the areas used for stationary and ﬂowing trafﬁc proportional to the increasing
population densities resulting from the reurbanization that has been recently observed is
neither conceivable nor desirable. This also goes for the highly overloaded long-distance
road network, for which there is barely any room left for expansion precisely in the
conurbations with the largest capacity deﬁcits.
In light of this, it remains a primary goal of the whole of society to safeguard and
improve the mobility of persons and goods. This is done by reducing trafﬁc volume by
structural changes (prevention), spreading transport demand across various modes (dis-
placement), and efﬁciently using existing infrastructure.
Besides the prospect of greater “participation in social life” travel for those groups of
people whose mobility is currently limited, autonomous driving offers an outlook of
signiﬁcantly improved options for using current infrastructures. Moreover, there is also
the chance here of reclaiming for other uses urban space now devoted to road trafﬁc.
The articles in “Trafﬁc” approach these prospects from various angles, see how they
hold up under examination, and demonstrate options for rolling out autonomous driving
from an infrastructure and trafﬁc-management perspective. Since road safety is an
essential precondition for introducing autonomous driving, light will also be shed on
opportunities for increasing safety and the safety risks linked to autonomous driving.
Bernhard Friedrich
The chapter Trafﬁc Control and Trafﬁc Management in a Transportation System with
Autonomous Vehicles by Peter Wagner describes how mixed trafﬁc composed of auton-
omous and conventional vehicles can be modeled in its interaction. The aim of such
modeling is to recognize systemic effects that may arise. The simulations of motorized
road trafﬁc in cities carried out on the basis of this modeling permit an assessment of the
potential effects on trafﬁc of autonomous driving in an urban context.
In the chapter The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles on Trafﬁc by Bernhard Friedrich, the
impact of autonomous vehicles on the capacities of free stretches of highways and of
intersections with trafﬁc lights is deduced using trafﬁc-ﬂow theory. It may be the case that
the effects of autonomous vehicles on the connection qualities of journeys running over
different infrastructure elements cannot yet be extensively described with these deliber-
ations. However, the considerations still provide an estimate of what potential for opti-
mizing trafﬁc-ﬂow efﬁciency might be linked with autonomous vehicles.
Based on existing accident-research analysis, Thomas Winkle’s meta-analysis Safety
Beneﬁts of Automated Vehicles: Extended Findings from Accident Research for Devel-
opment, Validation and Testing begins by documenting examples of the potential beneﬁts
of safety-enhancing systems with low degrees of automation. Robust studies on driverless
vehicles with a range of functions close to mass-production levels, on the other hand, are
still lacking. It thus remains for forecasts to estimate the theoretical potential safety
beneﬁts. Such estimates rest on, among other things, the fact that over 90&#xA0;% of
today’s road accidents are attributable to human error. In light of this, the vision of
widespread use of driverless vehicles in road trafﬁc promises a societal beneﬁt well worth
striving for, even if driverless-vehicle technology does not achieve absolute perfection.
The application of autonomous vehicles in the area of road freight transport is sketched
out in Heike Flämig’s chapter Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight
Transport. Taking as its starting point an analysis of a logistics chain, the changes
resulting from autonomous driving for businesses and society are critically discussed, as
are the necessary preconditions for its implementation. The author ﬁnds that opportunities
for better use of the infrastructure and optimizing logistics processes can be expected to
arise from the deployment of driverless vehicles. The reorganization of processes in many
supply chains within the overall logistics system will be a prerequisite for this, however.
Vehicle-on-Demand (VoD) systems are the most far-reaching application of autono-
mous vehicles. The impact on transport is described in the chapter Autonomous
Mobility-on-Demand Systems for Future Urban Mobility by Marco Pavone. The author’s
deliberations make it clear that a new organization of urban trafﬁc using VoD is funda-
mentally possible and would bring with it many beneﬁts. The communal use of VoD
means far fewer vehicles would be required for equally good mobility provision.
Autonomous vehicles’ ability to easily relocate themselves allows for supply to be
adjusted to demand in a time-dependent manner, thus avoiding waiting times. The
modeling calculations show that only 70 % of the vehicles in use today would be needed
to provide New York with the same level of taxi provision it currently enjoys. Further
298
Part III:
Traffic
calculation shows that for a city such as Singapore to maintain comparable levels of
supply, only a third of the current vehicle stock level would be required.
Even though it has not been possible to satisfactorily answer questions on trafﬁc-related
aspects of autonomous driving regarding mixed trafﬁc with normal vehicles, and espe-
cially with pedestrians and cyclists, the individual chapters anticipate an essentially
improved utilization of the available infrastructure and a stabilization of trafﬁc ﬂow. This
will involve multifarious opportunities for enhanced mobility of persons and goods,
accompanied by a reduction in environmental impact and a clawing back of public space
for urban living. The conception of robust migration paths for the development of
transport systems with due consideration of the infrastructure will be essential for a
successful roll out of autonomous vehicles. In these paths, increasing automation as well
as its increasing permeation of the whole system must be able to be ﬂexibly mapped.
Corresponding concepts will be formed for allocation of spaces for autonomous, normal,
and mixed trafﬁc, and for speciﬁc rules for speed, in order to guarantee a high level of road
safety.

Traffic Control and Traffic Management
in a Transportation System
with Autonomous Vehicles
Peter Wagner
15.1
Motivation
This paper aims to quantify the effects of autonomous driving on the trafﬁc management
level. This involves developing a model of autonomous driving that makes it possible to
use human-controlled and autonomous vehicles with only minor modiﬁcations. This is
important with regard to deﬁning how the instruments of trafﬁc management need to be
developed in the future to enable them to handle autonomous vehicles in the transportation
system. Of particular interest in this context is mixed trafﬁc, in which normal and auton-
omously driving vehicles interact with each other. This will presumably be the normal state
of affairs on roads for quite some time even after the introduction of autonomous vehicles;
it is, therefore, of great practical signiﬁcance to gain a good understanding of precisely this
situation to predict and prevent any systemic effects that may occur.
Since such vehicles do not yet exist, portions of the following observations must be
regarded as an initial appraisal of possible developments presented as a scenario. How-
ever, modeling of human drivers is likewise far from complete, so the focus in this paper
will be on establishing consistent modeling. The objective of the modeling presented here
is to describe, as far as possible, human and autonomous vehicles with the same model,
distinguished only by the different parameters used. A good example of this is the distance
to the vehicle ahead expressed in terms of the time gap: an autonomous vehicle can
achieve times of 0.3…0.5 s [1], whereas vehicles driven by humans are legally required to
maintain a distance of at least 0.9 s (in Germany). The legal recommendation is actually
2.0 s, but this is seldom maintained except when trafﬁc volumes are low. In heavy trafﬁc,
the value is often signiﬁcantly lower; the ﬁgure for heavily traveled autobahns that occurs

most often is 1.1 s (see Fig. 15.3), with an average value of 1.4 s. If drivers complied with
the legally stipulated speciﬁcations, trafﬁc on many roads would come to a standstill much
earlier than is currently the case.
This paper builds on the papers by Friedrich [2] and Pavone [3] in this book. While [2]
describes the general effects of autonomous vehicles on the transportation system, this
paper addresses the modeling of autonomous and human-driven vehicles as well as the
effects of autonomous vehicles on trafﬁc management. Paper [3], by contrast, largely
ignores questions of trafﬁc ﬂow and trafﬁc control and focuses primarily on the optimal
allocation of supply in relation to demand based on the premise that vehicles can be
shared. We can quite rightly conclude at this point that a combination of these approaches,
together with a correct description of the share of travelers who would opt for trans-
portation via a robotic “mobility-on-demand” system, allows the best possible appraisal of
the potential of autonomous vehicles.
The paper also does not consider effects that would result from a fundamentally dif-
ferent organization of transportation. One example of this would be the EU’s CityMobil
project, in which such scenarios are discussed and examined in greater detail [4].
This paper will examine how autonomous vehicles affect typical trafﬁc management
applications by looking at a few examples which have not been developed in all speciﬁcs.
These examples, in order of increasing complexity, are the simulation of a single trafﬁc
signal system (Sect. 15.4), simulation of an intersection controlled by an adaptive trafﬁc
signal system (Sect. 15.5), simulation of a green wave (Sect. 15.6) and the simulation of
an entire city (Sect. 15.7).
Some of the questions to be considered here can draw on the effects of the introduction
of intelligent speed control (autonomous intelligent speed control—AIC) on trafﬁc ﬂow on
highways in particular [5]. There is a great deal of literature on this subject; the disser-
tation [5] and parts of the book [10] provide a more in-depth overview than is possible in
this chapter.
One such AIC scenario is highly similar to Use Case #1 “Interstate Pilot Using Driver
for Extended Availability”, which in turn (from a trafﬁc-ﬂow standpoint) is a special
variant of Use Case #3, “Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability”. This is
also the use case that plays the most important role in this chapter, notwithstanding the
fact that it is rather irrelevant from the trafﬁc-ﬂow standpoint whether the driver is
available or not. The availability of the driver could be important if the impact of failures
on trafﬁc ﬂow was being examined, but this topic will not be addressed in this book. This
would require detailed statistics regarding how frequently something of this sort occurs
and under what circumstances—information which is not available at the current stage of
technology of autonomous vehicles. The Use Cases #2 (Autonomous Valet Parking) and
#4 (Vehicle on Demand) play only a minor role in this chapter, although Use Case #4
should be treated like Use Case #3 from a trafﬁc-ﬂow standpoint. Use Case #2 would be
interesting because it has an inﬂuence on parking search trafﬁc and thus indirectly on
trafﬁc demand and thereby also trafﬁc control, but on the trafﬁc management level it
would require a signiﬁcantly more complex approach than can be achieved here—it would
302
P. Wagner
require, for example, a precise quantiﬁcation of the parking search trafﬁc in a city. Even
the simulation of the city of Braunschweig described in Sect. 15.7 assumes that vehicles
that have reached their destinations always immediately ﬁnd a parking spot.
15.2
A Model of Driving
Models that describe how a human drives a vehicle have been around for a long time [6].
Very many of these models (for an overview see [7–10])—since 1950 more than 100
models have been described solely for the process of following a vehicle driving ahead—
can also without further ado be applied as models for autonomous vehicles, albeit with
differing parameters for humans and machines as mentioned in Sect. 15.1. It is thus
conceptually quite simple to model mixed trafﬁc and quantify its effects on the trans-
portation system as a whole.
In the following, the focus will be on the process of following a vehicle, which is the
most important, but not the only relevant process that determines the development of
trafﬁc ﬂow on roads.
Every vehicle is described by its position x(t), which depends on the time t and is
deﬁned in relation to some reference (e.g. the beginning of the current section of road), by
its velocity v(t) and its acceleration a(t); see also Fig. 15.1. In multi-lane trafﬁc, the lane in
which the vehicle is driving—the lateral coordinate, or distance of the vehicle from the
edge of the road—comes in as a variable as well. Ideally each vehicle should also be
indexed; this is circumvented in the following by describing the vehicle driving ahead
with uppercase letters X tð Þ; V tð Þ; A tð Þ. With the additional variables gap g tð Þ ¼ X tð Þ 
x tð Þ  ‘ and difference in velocity Dv tð Þ ¼ V tð Þ  v tð Þ (see also Fig. 15.1), the reaction of
the following vehicle can then be deﬁned as the acceleration that the vehicle applies in a
particular situation:
a ¼ d
dt v ¼ _v ¼ f v; g; Dv
ð
Þ
ð15:1Þ
This abstract Eq. (15.1) could be abstracted even further; lacking, for example, are
models for driver errors and ﬂuctuations as well as the modeling of a reaction time.
A corresponding error model is introduced in Sect. 15.3, although reaction time, a
notoriously thorny construct, is excluded entirely. While measurement data does very

frequently show that the acceleration of a following vehicle lags approximately 2 s behind
the acceleration of the vehicle driving ahead, there are also cases in which the following
vehicle starts braking approximately 1 s before the leading vehicle—for example when
approaching a trafﬁc signal (trafﬁc light). In the following, we will examine the abstract
Eq. (15.1) with greater speciﬁcity. For example, one important question for the following
observations is how precisely an autonomous vehicle moves. Surprisingly, many of the
current adaptive cruise control systems and also published control algorithms work for
automatic vehicles [11–13] as linear control systems:
_v ¼ a g  g v
ð Þ
ð
Þ þ bDv
ð15:2Þ
Typical parameters for the two time constants are represented by a ¼ 1=20 1/s2 and
b ¼ 1=1:5 1/s; with these values, cruise control systems are conﬁgured in a way that is
perceived by drivers as agreeable and natural [14]. For the preferred gap g v
ð Þ ¼ vs, as a
rule the legal regulation is applied, albeit with a somewhat smaller value for the preferred
time gap s, e.g. s ¼ 1:5 s, which is also used in the rest of this chapter. The model in
Eq. (15.2) was originally introduced in Helly 1959 [15] as a model describing a human
driver. This underscores the assertion that many driver models and the models for
autonomous driving are mathematically very similar. Where they differ will be discussed
in greater detail in Sect. 15.3.
The model in Eq. (15.2) has limits. For example, it is crash-free only for particular
parameters ða; bÞ, and is only string stable for a small subset of parameters. String stability
is the ability of a chain of vehicles driving behind each other not to succumb to the “slinky
effect” and jam up: for instance, when minor braking by the ﬁrst vehicle in the chain leads
to an ampliﬁed effect along the chain, in extreme cases actually causing a vehicle in the
chain to come to a standstill. Or causing a trafﬁc accident. To date, this behavior has only
been found in very speciﬁc situations (see [21] for an example)—it does not appear to be
the normal case.
However, the parameters with string stability are not perceived as very agreeable by
human drivers, so AIC systems generally apply a compromise solution that results in a
weak string instability [14].
For that reason, this paper looks at a different approach in the tradition of the models in
[16–18]. A ﬁrst step considers that an important condition for safe driving is fulﬁlled when
the following applies:
d v
ð Þ þ vs  D V
ð Þ þ g:
In this equation, D V
ð Þ; d v
ð Þ are the braking distances of the leading and following
vehicles. Obviously this model is predicated on the following driver having an idea of
whether and how the leading vehicle will drive or brake. That is certainly not entirely
adequate; and yet driving does work in many cases on the assumption that the other
drivers will behave more or less as one does oneself.
304

However, that also means that the approach ﬂowing from this and the following
equation can be tricked by “strange” behavior on the part of the leading vehicle. If the
leading vehicle has an autonomous emergency braking system that allows deceleration
values of up to 12 m/s2, it violates the assumption of similar behavior to the following
vehicle—typical deceleration values for a human driver are in the range of up to max.
4 m/s2—leading to a much shorter braking distance. This can be compensated for to some
extent, as the following simulation results also show, because the equations resulting from
this approach in the case of strong braking by the leading vehicle can exceed their own
deceleration. At the same time, this approach is one that could ﬁnd further application in
the development of driver models for trafﬁc safety.
The above model can be developed further by stipulating that the safety condition be
fulﬁlled not at the current time t, but also for a certain time t + T in the future. The time
T is the anticipation time, i.e. the length of the planning horizon of the driver. With the
notation x′ as a short-hand for the value of the variable x at the time t + T, the safety
equation becomes:
d v0
ð Þ þ v0s  D V0

But this equation can now be reformulated according to acceleration a. Thus x0 ¼
x þ vT þ aT2=2 and together with an approach for the braking distances dðvÞ ¼ v2=ð2bÞ,
the safety equation can be solved for a. There are various approaches for this; here
primarily the following exact approach is pursued:

Although these equations look complicated, and it is rather unlikely that people can
actually extract a root from a complex expression while driving, graphically it does
strongly resemble the Helly model. This is interesting because it is indeed quite easy to
imagine that a human driver is capable of carrying out a linear consideration along the
lines of “I’m moving somewhat faster than the person in front of me, but the gap is large,
so there is no immediate need to change anything.” An idea of how this acceleration
function looks for realistically selected parameters is provided by Fig. 15.2.

In this context it is also interesting to know whether this approach is indeed free of
collisions. The simple answer is no. Under some circumstances, the dynamic that follows
from Eq. (15.3) can indeed be fooled. This can be demonstrated by a chain of vehicles
following a leading vehicle that is driving according to a speciﬁc protocol a0 tð Þ. The
salient parameters in the dynamics of the leading vehicle are primarily the maximum
accelerations. Of particular interest here are the maximum decelerations and the question
as to whether it is possible to produce a collision with the model.
Of course, no procedure can really test all eventualities. But the following approach
does at least allow an estimation of how secure the models are. In a simulation, n = 50
vehicles follow a leading vehicle that selects its acceleration according to a speciﬁc
protocol. Among other things, it repeatedly decelerates to a standstill, in some cases with
decelerations at the limits of current driving dynamics capabilities. Studies on this set-up
very quickly revealed that collisions can only be avoided in the models when the antic-
ipation time T during braking is set to a lower value. In the following the models are
always operated with T = 2 s in normal driving, and with T = 0.5 s when braking.
The respective simulations then show that, under these conditions, no accidents occur
with the model in Eq. (15.3), at least not with the selected protocol a0 tð Þ. The Helly
model, however, is not so tolerant with the selected parameters and occasionally produces
rear-end collisions.

Man Versus Machine
At this point the question arises as to what actually distinguishes a human driver from an
autonomous vehicle. Heretofore just one signiﬁcant difference has been established, and
that is the time gap s with which the two drive. Humans should not drive with a gap of less
than s ¼ 0:9 s, and the legal recommendation is actually s ¼ 2 s; in principle, a machine
can drive with a s ¼ 0:3. . .0:5 s gap [1]. An example analysis of the actually maintained
gaps (see Fig. 15.3) on a German autobahn (with speed around 100 km/h, where the
greatest trafﬁc volumes are achieved) shows that (very) few human drivers approach this
“ideal”, whereas the overwhelming majority demonstrates legally compliant behavior.
Figure 15.3 also shows that human behavior covers a broad spectrum which stands in
contrast to autonomous vehicles: they would all drive with a small and very similar value
of s. This spectrum can be characterized [20] and quantiﬁed in greater detail. In general it
can be said that s not only varies between different drivers, but indeed is not even
consistent for the same driver. Unfortunately s is not precisely observable, in particular
when the leading vehicle itself constantly changes speed, so it is only possible to posit
assumptions as to how s varies over time. This then leads to 2D models [20, 21], in which
s varies in each time step. A simple scenario that leads to such a dynamic is the driver
misjudging the gap. However, this error is time-correlated, i.e. when the estimated gap at a
certain point in time is smaller than the actual gap, this will continue to be the case for a
certain period thereafter as well. And there is a reasonable probability that the error will be
asymmetrical: Gaps are frequently estimated to be signiﬁcantly smaller than they actually
are. Such a modeling approach does in any case lead to a very broad spectrum of s values,
just as is observed empirically.
A second point in which a human differs from a machine is what is known as the action
point mechanism [22]. Strictly speaking, a human driver cannot be described by a dif-
ferential Eq. (15.1). Rather, a vehicle is controlled through correction of the acceleration
(accelerator-pedal position) at irregular time intervals, as shown in the example Fig. 15.4.

The time gaps between successive action points also demonstrate a very broad dis-
tribution, with values between 0.5 and 1.5 s. Here there is evidently another modeling
approach for trafﬁc safety questions—if the time between two action points becomes very
long, a critical situation can arise. In normal cases that does not occur, however, and there
are only minor variances between a model based on Eq. (15.1) and a model in which the
action points are explicitly used [23]. In particular, the action point mechanism alone does
not lead to a wide distribution of gaps between the vehicles.
This too is demonstrated in the example used in Sect. 15.2 of the chain of vehicles
following a leading vehicle. An evaluation of the gap measured (in the simulation), here as
a function of the number of the following vehicle, shows that in most cases an autono-
mous vehicle follows the leading vehicle with signiﬁcantly less variance—in spite of the
sometimes extremely volatile behavior. A representation of this is found in Fig. 15.5.

Thus the models used in this chapter have been speciﬁed, and the difference between
the human and the autonomous driving style has been characterized. The rest of this
chapter will utilize various applications to illustrate what that means for typical trafﬁc
management applications.
15.4
Approaching a Traffic Signal
This process is one of the candidates in which autonomous vehicles promise signiﬁcant
beneﬁts. In an approach to a trafﬁc signal, the following examines the delay d per vehicle
for a random combination of normal and autonomous vehicles. Here, g describes the share
of autonomously driving vehicles, whereas s ¼ 0:5 s is assumed for autonomous and
s ¼ 1:5 s for normal vehicles. The simulation results are also supported by a theoretical
consideration. There is a theory for the described situation which was developed in [24].
Interestingly, the theory can be applied to a situation with a mix of autonomous and
normal vehicles. Then the respective expression is:

In Eq. (15.4), q is the demand, s0 the capacity of a ﬂow of human-guided vehicles, s1
the capacity of a ﬂow of automated vehicles, g the green time and c the cycle time of the
trafﬁc signal. The cycle time is the time it takes for the trafﬁc signal to regain the same
state it had at the beginning. The simulation results for selected variations in demand
(q) and the share of autonomous vehicles η is shown in Fig. 15.6.
The curves in Fig. 15.6 were recorded by simulating various values of demand
q (varying from 18 to 1800 veh./h) for 5 h each. The demand itself is a stochastic variable

(approximately Poisson-distributed), i.e. in each observed time interval, there is always a
different number of vehicles and only the average over many such time intervals leads to
the correct demand.
The delay was recorded for each simulated vehicle and the values used to calculate the
average entered in Fig. 15.6. In principle, the entire distribution of delays can be used to
characterize the results, which for reasons of space is omitted here, although it would be
interesting. The ﬂuctuations in the delays are a measure of the reliability of such a system.
However, the example presented here shows that the delay ﬂuctuations are only very
weakly correlated with the proportion of autonomously guided vehicles; the major source of
stochasticity in this system is generated by the demand and not the dynamics of the vehicles.
Two results in Fig. 15.6 stand out. For one thing, the description from the theory does
not always correspond to the simulation results. A considerable amount of research is still
needed here, because it’s not at all simple to translate the assumptions on which the theory
is based into the simulated reality. This will undoubtedly be even more difﬁcult in
comparison with real measured values. To achieve agreement, the values for the
saturation-trafﬁc volume determined in the simulation had to be used—with the theoretical
values, i.e. the τ values deﬁned in Sect. 15.3, the agreement is not compelling.
Second, autonomous vehicles “only” change the capacity; otherwise there are no or
only very small gains. As long as the demand stays away from the respective capacity,
there are only minor differences between the various scenarios, at least on the level of the
description selected here.
A change in the capacity does have one very positive effect, however: it means that the
required green times at a trafﬁc signal can be shorter, leaving more time for other modes of
transport.
15.5
Adaptive Traffic Signals
Section 15.4 looked at a trafﬁc signal with a ﬁxed-time control system. Many modern
systems, however, utilize an adaptive control system. That means that the trafﬁc signal
attempts to coordinate its green times with the current demand. When demand is low, the

green times are short, and when demand is high, the system responds with long green
times. The details are somewhat more complex, because the delay regarded as a function
of the demand has a minimum with a certain optimal cycle time. An adaptive system is
able to choose the optimal cycle time for itself, and makes very clever use of the ﬂuc-
tuations that occur in the trafﬁc ﬂow.
In this case as well, the aim is to examine how such an adaptive system handles a mix
of autonomous and normal vehicles. To this purpose, simulation of a two-armed inter-
section controlled with an adaptive method was set up [27]. The two arms are 600 m long,
and the delay per vehicle at intersection is measured. In contrast to Sect. 15.4, however, a
demand was selected that depends on the time and thus replicates a peak hour group in
which at the time of maximum demand the system is saturated in spite of its adaptivity.
The demand function selected here is:
q tð Þ ¼ q0 þ q1 sin pt
T


;
where q0 is a basic load, q1 is the amplitude of the demand ﬂuctuation and T is the entire
time period of the simulation. Both arms are subjected to the same demand, which
represents a relatively unfavorable case.
Beyond the delays, in this case it is primarily the green times that are of interest. Since
the system adapts the times to the demand, they ﬂuctuate within typical ranges. In many
countries, the green time cannot ﬂuctuate freely: for instance, the green time for a normal
trafﬁc signal cannot sink below 5 s, and in the following simulations, the maximum green
time is set to 40 s.
Such a simulation is also an interesting case in the evaluation of the simulation data.
A single simulation of such a peak hour shows major ﬂuctuations in terms of delays as
well as green time and cycle times. Although the delays were averaged over a cycle of the
system, that in itself is not sufﬁcient because the cycles are themselves stochastic variables

whose average values and statistics can only be determined through a sufﬁcient number of
repetitions of the same scenario with slightly different details—just as in reality when
successive days are examined. To obtain statistically valid results, in this case the peak
hour was repeated 50 times. At 5-min intervals, the averages of the delays over the last
cycle and the corresponding green times set by the system were collected. The results in
Fig. 15.7 were composed from this data.
With maximum demand, the system extends the green times up to the limit of 40 s and
thereby demonstrates that it has reached its saturation level. However, this only applies for
a ﬂow of normal vehicles. As soon as autonomous vehicles are added to the mix, the top
delay value for sinks and with an equipment rate of 50 %, the maximum green time is not
even reached. This lines up with the observation in Sect. 15.4 that autonomous vehicles
not only increase the capacity, but also contribute to a reduction in green times—an effect
that is rather clear in this example, namely that even a small proportion of autonomously
guided vehicles can make a noticeable impact.
15.6
Green Wave with Autonomous Vehicles
The previous scenarios examined a single intersection. Much more interesting is the case
of a stretch of road with multiple intersections in succession which are all controlled by a
trafﬁc signal system. In this case the coordination between the trafﬁc signals, known
Fig. 15.9 Excerpt of the simulation network for Braunschweig. The land use data comes from the
openstreetmap dataset [26]. Image rights: copyright resides with author
312
P. Wagner
colloquially as the green wave, plays an important role. Here again, a simulation is used to
investigate how great an impact the introduction of autonomous vehicles has. Analogous
to the procedure in [28], a section of road with 10 intersections is simulated with varying
coordination conﬁgurations. The demand, which is constant, the green times and the cycle
times remain unchanged. The only change is to the offset, i.e. the point in time at which
the trafﬁc signal turns green for the vehicle ﬂow in a particular direction. If this offset
between two signals is precisely equal to the travel time between the two signals, the
system is in its optimal state: the delay for the vehicles at the downstream signal is exactly
zero when the green times are equal. In that case, just as many vehicles can cross the
intersection as left the upstream trafﬁc signal.
The expectation is clear: In this case, no improvements will be achieved with an
autonomous vehicle; and that is precisely what the simulation results in Fig. 15.8
demonstrate. However, autonomous vehicles do indeed improve the delay times in the
case of sub-optimal coordination. The reason is that the bunch of vehicles that leaves a
trafﬁc signal is more compressed than with human drivers.
15.7
Simulation of a City
This ﬁnal section will examine how the introduction of autonomous vehicles might impact
an entire city. To this purpose, an existing SUMO simulation [19 25] of the city of
Braunschweig is used to simulate the impact of autonomous vehicles on the trafﬁc ﬂow of
a transportation system.
However, the model introduced in Sect. 15.2 is not implemented in SUMO, so the
simulation has to be carried out with the models that are available in SUMO. The sim-
ulation therefore uses the standard model integrated in SUMO, which in terms of
describing the ﬂuctuations of the drivers is not as reﬁned as the model introduced here.

To set up the model, a modiﬁed network by the NavTeq company is used; an extract of
the transportation network is seen in Fig. 15.9. The full simulation comprises the entire
area of the city of Braunschweig, including the autobahns in the area. The simulation
network comprises approximately 129,000 edges.
The required trafﬁc demand comes from a start/destination matrix from the PTV
company, which is available for different days of the week in 24 time slices of one hour
each for each of those days. This demand was used to calculate a user equilibrium, which
in this case required some 100 iteration steps. At the end of this process, for each vehicle
simulated in SUMO there is an optimal route in the sense that every other route through
the network would take longer. A total of 647,000 vehicles were simulated. Initial
comparisons with real data from Braunschweig suggest that the matrix signiﬁcantly
underestimates the demand. This undoubtedly affects the results discussed here, but it was
not possible to carry out such corrections in the context of this project.
To simulate autonomous vehicles, a new vehicle type is introduced which has similar
parameters to the models in Sect. 15.2: the autonomous vehicles in SUMO drive with
τ = 0.5 s, all others with τ = 1 and σ = 0.5. σ is the noise parameter in SUMO, i.e. it
indicates by how much a vehicle deviates from the optimal driving style. The selection of
τ = 0.5 s means that the time-step size in SUMO also has to be set to 0.5 s to ensure that
the vehicles can continue to drive without colliding. This extends the simulation time from
around 50 min to 90 min for the simulation of an entire day in Braunschweig.
Only the passenger vehicles were simulated as autonomous vehicles; the approximately
44,000 trucks remained unchanged. The trafﬁc signals were likewise not entirely correctly
represented in the simulation. It may therefore be assumed that on this end as well, further
corrections to the simulation results below can be expected.
Nevertheless, this simulation delivers signiﬁcant preliminary results, as seen in
Fig. 15.10. Even without further measures, the autonomous system is more efﬁcient in the
sense that it reduces delays between 5 and 80 %, with an average value of around 40 %.
With the selected parameters, however, the variance in travel times changes relatively
little; the system, in other words, becomes faster, but not necessarily more reliable. That
could change if the trafﬁc management system were also realistically simulated. Such
studies are currently in the works.
15.8
Conclusion
This paper presents some initial considerations regarding how trafﬁc management needs to
respond to the opportunities presented by autonomous driving. The case studies presented
here demonstrate that, depending on the scenario, very different improvements can be
achieved in the ﬂow of trafﬁc through the introduction of autonomous vehicles.
Unfortunately, the improvements that could be achieved are difﬁcult to summarize with
a single number. It was demonstrated in Sect. 15.4, for example, that the capacity of a
trafﬁc signal can certainly be doubled. If the demand is low at the corresponding signal,
314
P. Wagner
this doubling is scarcely noticeable. But if the signal is working at the limits of its
capacity, by contrast, even a minor increase in its capacity can lead to a dramatic
improvement.
This can be observed quite clearly in the scenario in Sect. 15.5: here the demand runs
the values from very low to (temporary) over-saturation. Although the introduction of
autonomous vehicles has little impact on green times and delays when demand is low, it
yields major improvements when the system is operating beyond capacity. Nevertheless,
the magnitude of these improvements does depend on the details of the scenario being
examined. If the peak value for demand were just a bit lower, the beneﬁt would also be
signiﬁcantly diminished.
That notwithstanding, it may be asserted with conﬁdence that at least in the urban
context, the introduction of autonomous vehicles has the potential to generate substantial
time gains at trafﬁc signals which would then be available for other road users—if the
introduction of these vehicles does not lead to an increase in demand for automotive
transportation.

The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles
on Traffic
Bernhard Friedrich
16.1
Introduction
Objective
Autonomous vehicles maneuver in trafﬁc through road networks without requiring
humans as supervisors or decision makers. Autonomous vehicles increase comfort for
their passengers by removing the need for them to perform driving tasks. Autonomous
vehicles provide new mobility opportunities for groups of people that thus far have been
partially or entirely excluded from participation in public life due to mobility restrictions.
In addition to the beneﬁts that autonomous vehicles potentially provide their users, the
social beneﬁts that would come with their proliferation are of interest. For it is clear that
autonomous driving does not lead to a loss of safety or efﬁciency of road transport but
rather improves them. This paper considers the trafﬁc impact of autonomous vehicles,
looking speciﬁcally at the efﬁciency of using the existing infrastructure.
The efﬁciency of the transport infrastructure is determined by its capacity. On high-
ways, the capacity is dependent to a large degree on the maximum possible ﬂow of trafﬁc
on the road sections as well as the capacity of entry, merging and exit lanes at
grade-separated trafﬁc intersections. In the city road network, and on country roads with
through-roads, the capacities at the intersections are the crucial factor and therefore mostly
dependent on trafﬁc signaling. While the capacity at trafﬁc lights is determined by the
amount of time required by individual vehicles in the departing lane to pass the node, the
capacity of highway sections is determined by the instability that occurs at high trafﬁc
volumes and leads to congestion.

In order to understand the various factors that determine the effect of trafﬁc on
autonomous vehicles, the key characteristics of trafﬁc ﬂow and their interdependent ele-
ments are the initial focus of this paper. Building on these foundations, we will derive the
impact of autonomous vehicles on the capacity of highway segments as well as on
intersections with trafﬁc signals. The impact of autonomous vehicles on the connection
quality of journeys covering different infrastructure elements cannot be adequately
described in this model. Nevertheless, these considerations provide a preliminary
assessment of the potential for optimizing the efﬁciency of trafﬁc ﬂow that potentially
includes autonomous vehicles.
16.2
Characteristics of Traffic Flow
16.2.1 Parameters of Traffic Flow
In order to develop a mathematical model of trafﬁc ﬂow, we use an abstraction of the road
network, the vehicles, the drivers and their behavior. Certain simplifying assumptions are
therefore made.
The road network is divided, for example, into road segments and intersections. We
investigate here, therefore, either road segments or intersections where consistent condi-
tions, i.e., ﬂatness, sufﬁcient visibility, dry surface, etc. are assumed. With regard to
drivers and vehicles, it is expected, among other things, that properties such as reaction
time, willingness to engage in risks and technical proﬁciency follow an empirically proven
statistical distribution.
A distinction is to be made between several ways of describing trafﬁc ﬂow. The
microscopic model describes the relevant characteristics of a single vehicle i:
– temporal headway ti sð Þ
– spatial separation xi m
ð Þ
– speed vi km=h
ð
Þ.
The macroscopic descriptive model takes into consideration many vehicles and the
relevant properties of a trafﬁc ﬂow:
– trafﬁc volume q veh=h
ð
Þ
– trafﬁc density k veh=km
ð
Þ
– mean speed v km=h
ð
Þ.
The trafﬁc ﬂow can be recorded by measuring the parameters of a particular
cross-section over a time interval dt by means of so-called local observations or mea-
surements at a given time over a path interval dx, which are so-called momentary
observations (Fig. 16.1).
318
B. Friedrich
16.2.2 Traffic Flow Theory
Neither the macroscopic parameters v, q, and k, nor the corresponding microscopic values,
deﬁne in themselves a trafﬁc state. In order to deﬁne a trafﬁc state, knowledge of their
interdependencies is a prerequisite. The three macroscopic quantities, trafﬁc volume,
trafﬁc density and momentary speed, are dependent on one another according to the
equation
q ¼ k  v k
ð Þ
Measurements of trafﬁc volume and mean speed resulted in a detectable decrease in
speed when trafﬁc volume increases, i.e., with increasing mutual inﬂuence of vehicles.
One of the ﬁrst models to describe trafﬁc ﬂow on an open stretch road came from
observations made by Greenshields [1], who researched the relationship between the
speed v and the trafﬁc density k. With the help of regression analysis, he established a
linear relationship for v ¼ v k
ð Þ

where vf represents the free ﬂow speed and kmax the maximum trafﬁc density.
Inserted into the equation q ¼ v  k, this results in a parabolic relationship between
trafﬁc volume and trafﬁc density in the form:
q k
ð Þ ¼ vf 

Equations with these parameters are referred to as equations of state and their graphical
representations are called fundamental diagrams of trafﬁc ﬂow.
16.2.3 Model for Stationary Traffic Conditions—Fundamental
Diagram
The fundamental diagram is a graphical illustration of the equation of state for trafﬁc, i.e.,
the functional relationship between the parameters of trafﬁc volume q, trafﬁc density k,
and the mean momentary, i.e., section-related speed v, and represents a curve in
three-dimensional space. The orthogonal projections of the curve onto the planes, each
spanned by two parameters, result in the familiar fundamental diagram shown in
Fig. 16.2. The resulting three diagrams enable a variety of information about the char-
acteristics of trafﬁc ﬂow over a cross section to be depicted and are referred to as the q-
v diagram, the q-k diagram, and the k-v diagram.
The fundamental diagram shows that, for the same trafﬁc volume ql, two different
qualities of trafﬁc ﬂow can occur. The threshold qmax separates for qi\qmax the range of
high speeds at low trafﬁc densities, i.e., the free and stable ﬂow of trafﬁc, from the range
with relatively low speeds and high trafﬁc densities, i.e., the range of unstable and
interrupted trafﬁc ﬂow. Empirical studies reveal that the transition between a stable and an
unstable trafﬁc state does not run continuously as shown in Fig. 16.2 in idealized form.
Rather, in case of high trafﬁc load and triggered by disturbances a transition from the
stable to the unstable range takes place. This transition is associated with a signiﬁcant drop
in the trafﬁc volume (Fig. 16.3). In light of these considerations, May and Keller [2]
characterized three forms of trafﬁc that occur:
– Free trafﬁc at high speeds and low trafﬁc volumes and densities
– Partially constricted trafﬁc, up to the range of maximum trafﬁc volumes, optimal speed
and trafﬁc density
– Constricted trafﬁc with high trafﬁc densities, low trafﬁc volumes and speeds.

16.2.4 Capacity and Stability
The efﬁciency of the trafﬁc system depends on the capacity of the trafﬁc infrastructure.
This capacity is deﬁned as the “largest volume of trafﬁc that a trafﬁc ﬂow can reach at a
given distance and trafﬁc conditions at the cross-section determined for this ﬂow” [3]. The
capacity is determined by the density of the platoon of vehicles and the speed with which
the platoon passes through the cross-section.
Trafﬁc density is determined by the distances between vehicles. The rule of thumb is
that the safe distance in meters before the vehicle ahead that a driver should adhere to is
half the value of the current speed in kilometers per hour. This well-known rule of “half
speedometer distance” is based on a reaction time of less than 1.8 s, since at this value and
constant speed, precisely the distance to the preceding vehicle is travelled. This minimum
distance is also usually required by law (see, e.g., [4]). For trucks, road regulations
explicitly stipulate that, at speeds above 50 km/h, a minimum travel distance of 50 m
must be maintained, which requires a time interval of 2.25 s at the maximum speed limit
permissible for vehicles over 7.5 tons on highways.
Assuming a reaction time of 1.8 s, the capacity of a lane can be estimated, in a
simpliﬁed model, at about 2000 vehicles per hour. This applies equally to city streets as to
country roads and highways. However, empirical studies show that the headways are on
average signiﬁcantly shorter than 1.8 s and especially at high trafﬁc volumes amount to
1.0 s. The 15 % percentile of the distribution in these cases is even below 0.5 s (see also
Fig. 15.3 in the chapter by Peter Wagner in this book [5]). This means that 15 % of the
vehicles follow a preceding vehicle with a headway of less than 0.5 s. Figure 16.4 shows
the corresponding headway distributions for different trafﬁc volume ranges and different
speed limits.
Due to the short following distances at relatively high speeds, empirical studies also
investigate capacities that may be signiﬁcantly higher than the stated 2000 veh./h. Fur-
thermore, these studies indicate that there is no exact value where trafﬁc ﬂow stops being
stable and breaks down if this value is exceeded. Rather, it can be observed that the
capacity is a random parameter that can be represented by a distribution (Fig. 16.5).
Investigations of many sections of road [6] show that the capacity of highways are
typically Weibull-distributed and, for example for 3-lane highways, show a standard
deviation of about 600 veh./h (measured in 5-min intervals) and thus an unexpectedly
wide variability.
The expected value of the capacity corresponds in this stochastic depiction to a
nominal capacity and represents the 50th percentile of that trafﬁc volume amount that was
the starting point of a breakdown in trafﬁc ﬂow. The closer the trafﬁc load is to, or the
further it lies above, this nominal capacity, the higher the probability of trafﬁc breakdown
and trafﬁc congestion.
Trafﬁc breakdown results in all cases, passing through a transient state of synchronized
trafﬁc ﬂow to congested trafﬁc. Trafﬁc recovery occurs also via a transient state of syn-
chronized trafﬁc ﬂow, back to a steady ﬂow of trafﬁc with higher speeds (Fig. 16.6).
322
B. Friedrich
The trafﬁc volume also decreases in the transitions to synchronized or to congested trafﬁc
and a smaller recovery takes place. This effect of a “capacity drop” is caused by the fact
that drivers, in keeping a greater distance when leaving the downstream trafﬁc-jam front,

restrictions [7]

section of a two-lane highway, according to [6]

maintain a greater distance than before in ﬂowing trafﬁc before the breakdown in trafﬁc
ﬂow.
According to [8], this capacity drop is 5–6 %; studies on German highways reported
values between 4 and 12 % [6].
16.3
The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles on Traffic
The efﬁciency of the transport system depends on the capacity of a transport infrastructure.
When a transport infrastructure is used by autonomously driving vehicles, the capacity
will differ from that of a transport infrastructure used by human drivers. Either the
capacity of the route sections of the intersections or deﬁne the trafﬁc ﬂow. While the
capacities of the intersections and the trafﬁc signals are relevant to the performance of
urban road networks, on highways the capacities of open stretches of road are of principal
importance. For this reason, the following analysis considers the capacity for both cases,
taking into account that a yet-unknown proportion of vehicles drives autonomously.
16.3.1 Sections of Highways
16.3.1.1
Capacity
The capacity of a trafﬁc lane is determined by the maximum number of vehicles that can
pass through a cross section per unit of time. It is determined by the density of the vehicle
platoon and the speed with which the platoon passes through the cross-section. The
Fig. 16.6 Pattern of traffic dynamics with the transitions from the state of stable traffic into the
states of synchronized and congested traffic. The values were measured on a three-lane highway in
5-min intervals, according to [6]
324
B. Friedrich
equation of state that describes the relationship between these fundamental characteristics
of trafﬁc ﬂow is:
q ¼ k  v k
ð Þ
In a homogeneous trafﬁc ﬂow, the density is easily determined and results from the
reciprocal of the footprint of a vehicle [9]:
k ¼
1
vTh þ L :
In this context, Th is the temporal distance (time gap) to the preceding vehicle and L is
the length of a vehicle. Since the capacity represents the maximum trafﬁc volume qmax,
this is consequently a function of v; Th, and L. If only human drivers control the vehicle,
the capacity Ch results, with:
Ch ¼ qmax ¼
v
vTh þ L :
Analogously, the capacity Ca is described in a trafﬁc ﬂow that purely consists of
autonomous vehicles by the following function, where Ta represents the time gap pre-
ferred by autonomous vehicles.
Ca ¼
v
vTa þ L :
The ratio of the two capacity values and hence the change in the capacity is determined
by the relation
Ca=Ch ¼ vTh þ L
ð
Þ= vTa þ L
ð
Þ:
In order to evaluate the effect of autonomous vehicles on capacity values, values are
used for the parameters of the capacity formula that are empirically demonstrated for
today’s conditions. So it seems reasonable to assume as the mean speed at which the
capacity is reached the value v ¼ 80 km=h 22:2 m=s
ð
Þ. For the footprint of an average
passenger car, the broadly accepted mean vehicle length is 4.5 m and the minimum safety
distance to the vehicle ahead is 3.0 m, thus Lcar ¼ 7:5 m is used. The mean length of a
truck is estimated to be 18 m, which is the weighted average of the lengths of a truck
(18.75 m) and of a semi-trailer (16.50 m). For the footprint of a truck, assuming that a
3.0 m distance is kept before the vehicle ahead, Ltruck ¼ 21 m. As a reasonable value for
the mean following distance at high trafﬁc volumes, the empirical studies provide a value
of Th ¼ 1:15 s.
For the change in capacity for autonomous driving, the changed time gap Ta for the
following vehicle is the deciding factor. A technically feasible and, at the same time,
16
The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles on Traffic
325
acceptable value from the perspective of road users appears to be Ta ¼ 0:5 s. Depending
on the trafﬁc conditions, this very short following distance already occurs in up to 20 % of
all following distances. This distance therefore seems acceptable provided that safety is
ensured from a technical perspective.
For the assumed values, the capacity and thus the maximum ﬂow rate in the case of
purely autonomous trafﬁc would signiﬁcantly increase using the formulas derived above
(factor 1.78) (Fig. 16.7).
Compared to today’s observed capacity values of a lane of 2200 veh./h, an increase of
trafﬁc volume to about 3900 veh./h would thus be possible with purely autonomous trafﬁc.
If heavy trafﬁc is included in the trafﬁc ﬂow, the mean footprint of the vehicles can be
deduced from a sum that is weighted with the proportion of heavy trafﬁc ω. The trafﬁc
density is obtained in turn from the reciprocal of the mean footprint of a vehicle with
k ¼

If one assumes a moderate speed of 80 km/h for autonomous trafﬁc on German
motorways, we obtain the functional relationship shown in the following Fig. 16.8. If
trucks make up 15 % of trafﬁc, which is typical on German motorways, a capacity of
about 3877 veh./h would be achieved, which is almost twice the value compared to
today’s empirically proven capacity. If, for the sake of a plausibility check and with
otherwise unchanged parameters, one inserts Ta ¼ 1:15 s into the capacity formula, this
Fig. 16.7 Capacity increase that, depending on the speed, would result in an exclusively
autonomous vehicle fleet (only passenger cars)
326
B. Friedrich
results in a capacity of about 2280 veh./h for a heavy trafﬁc share of 15 %. This value
corresponds to the measured capacity at present conditions and conﬁrms the right choice
of the computational approach as well as the parameters.
In mixed trafﬁc, where autonomous vehicles are represented by a share of g in the total
volume, the capacity Cm is additionally dependent on percentage g:
Cm ¼
v
gvTa þ 1  g
ð
ÞvTh þ LPkw
:
If one inserts realistic values into the equation here, again with v ¼ 80 km=h and
Lcar ¼ 7:5 m, the correlation shown in the following graph results (Fig. 16.9). From the
graph, it is clear that the capacity increases more slowly at lower numbers of autonomous
vehicles. At g ¼ 0:5 capacity only reaches a value of about 3100 cars=h, and thus 36 % of
the increase that would be possible if all vehicles were autonomous.

Fig. 16.9 Capacity of a lane in proportion to the share of autonomous vehicles for pure passenger
car traffic
16
The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles on Traffic
327
If one also takes into account that autonomous vehicles should allow an additional
distance to a vehicle steered by a human driver so as not to harass these drivers, it is
slightly more complicated to determine the capacity. In this analysis, the combinations of
successive vehicles (a-a, a-h, h-a, and h-h) and the corresponding time gaps (Taa; Tah; Thx)
must be considered in order to arrive at a modiﬁed capacity equation:
Cm ¼
v
g2vTaa þ g 1  g
ð
ÞvTah þ 1  g
ð
ÞvThx þ L :
As realistic values for the headways, the values Taa ¼ 0:5 s; Tah ¼ 0:9 s; Thx ¼ 1:15 s
can be used. In this analysis, the capacity increases in proportion to the share of auton-
omous vehicles a little more slowly in the lower range and reaches for g ¼ 0:5 a value of
2850 veh./h on the way to achieving a capacity value of almost 4300 veh./h where 100 %
of vehicles are autonomous (Fig. 16.10).
The same procedure can be used to estimate the capacity for pure heavy-vehicle trafﬁc
that could be organized on a single lane of a highway. Not changing our assumptions for
the required time gaps, a required space of L ¼ 21 m is again assumed. For purely
autonomous driving, these input values result in a capacity value of 2420 trucks=h,
compared to a capacity value of 1720 trucks=h as achievable for human drivers.
16.3.1.2
Stability
Besides the capacity that equates to the greatest trafﬁc volume that a trafﬁc ﬂow at given
road and trafﬁc conditions at a cross-section can achieve, the stability of the trafﬁc ﬂow is
an important factor in its efﬁciency. This becomes clear when the capacity is considered as
a stochastic variable that represents the probability of trafﬁc breakdown as a function of
trafﬁc intensity. The greater the standard deviation of the probability distribution, the
greater is the likelihood of trafﬁc breakdown at lower trafﬁc volumes and thus instability.
Fig. 16.10 Capacity of a lane in relation to the share of autonomous vehicles for pure car traffic,
taking into account larger time gaps for autonomous vehicles following vehicles driven by people
328
B. Friedrich
If breakdown occurs, capacity is reduced by the effect of “capacity drop” noticeable at
the magnitude given in the above literature—by about 10 %. Given the same number of
lanes and same trafﬁc framework conditions (trafﬁc volume, proportion of heavy trafﬁc),
different spatial and temporal factors result in different capacity distribution functions. The
key factors in this regard are the speed and the time gap distributions. The smaller the
standard deviation, the more stable the ﬂow of trafﬁc will be, and the fewer breakdowns to
be expected at high trafﬁc volumes.
Especially when autonomous vehicles are able to anticipate the actions of preceding
vehicles through communication, they can contribute to a stabilization of trafﬁc ﬂow and
thus to stability. In purely autonomous trafﬁc, it is to be assumed that full stability will be
achieved and a capacity drop avoided.
16.3.2 Intersections with Traffic Lights
Since intersections as part of streets with high trafﬁc are usually controlled using trafﬁc
signals, the following considerations relate to the capacity of intersections with trafﬁc
signal control.
At high trafﬁc loads at intersections with trafﬁc lights, constant queues of trafﬁc occur
independently of the coordination of the trafﬁc signals. This is why it is usually the case
that the waiting queue of vehicles, once permitted by the green light to move, starts
moving from standstill. When the ﬁrst vehicle has departed at a green light, the next
follows once a certain time interval has lapsed. This time interval is represented by the
value of the time variable, which for standard conditions (no slope, trafﬁc travels in a
straight line, lane width is adequate) and pure passenger car trafﬁc amounts to tb ¼ 1:8 s
[10]. This corresponds to a saturation ﬂow of qs ¼ 2000 cars=h. The value for trucks and
buses is tb ¼ 3:15 s, and tb ¼ 4:5 s for semi-trailer truck.
At the start of the column of trafﬁc, the time at which departure occurs can be antic-
ipated from the movement of vehicles ahead. Thus the response time to the departure of
the driver directly in front is reduced and can be assumed to be Th ¼ 0:6 s. At a vehicle
length of 4.5 m and a distance of 3.0 m from bumper to bumper, an average footprint of a
car in the trafﬁc backlog in front of a trafﬁc light may be assumed to be 7.5 m, and
plausible values for the average speed at the stop line of the trafﬁc signal to be
v ¼ 22:5 km=h. One can thus conﬁrm the required time interval via the relation
tb ¼ Th þ L=v ¼ 1:8 s. This applies equally to the amount of time required by trucks and
semi-trailer trucks with lengths of 12 and 18 m respectively. Consequently, the saturation
ﬂow of a lane at a trafﬁc signal can be given by the equation of state:
qs ¼

The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles on Traffic
329
To analyze the saturation volumes of purely autonomous and mixed trafﬁc, the cor-
relations used here are those derived for the capacity of road sections with assumed values
for queues starting at trafﬁc signals of 22:5 km=h ¼ 6:25 m=s, Th ¼ 0:6 s. For autonomous
driving, it is assumed that the reaction time or the safety margin, even in dense and slow
urban trafﬁc, should not fall below Ta ¼ 0:3 s, Taa ¼ 0:3 s; Tah ¼ 0:6 s; Thx ¼ 0:6 s.
The capacity of a lane at intersections with trafﬁc lights is, on the one hand, determined by
saturation trafﬁc volumes and, on the other hand, by green intervals. Green intervals that are
allocated to different trafﬁc streams over the period of one hour are themselves affected by the
cycle times and the clearance intervals. During rush hours, a cycle time of 90 s is usually
chosen, meaning that there are forty clearance intervals within an hour. For a typical road
junction situated on an urban main street, a three-phase signal program is normally used. The
clearance intervals used for the main trafﬁc direction in the three phase-transitions typically
add up to around 20 s and are essentially dependent on the clearance times of crossing
pedestrians. With a cycle time of 90, 70 s remain for the green light intervals of the various
trafﬁc ﬂows. If one assumes that, from the remaining green interval, 50 % of the time is
available for the trafﬁc ﬂows in the main direction, within one hour a release time of 1400 s
and a release time share of pF ¼ 38:89 % results, i.e., a share of approximately 40 %.
In conﬂict-free signaling (i.e., there are no conditional compatibilities, e.g., with
pedestrians crossing parallel to the main trafﬁc), the capacity of mixed trafﬁc ﬂows is
determined using the above approach.
CLSA ¼ qs  pF ¼ v  pF
vTh þ L :
In current trafﬁc conditions where vehicles are exclusively controlled by humans, when
using the above values a capacity of about 800 cars=h per lane results. In purely auton-
omous trafﬁc with Ta ¼ 0:3 s, the capacity would increase to about 1120 cars=h and thus
increase by about 40 %. For a mixed composition of trafﬁc ﬂows, the efﬁciency gains are
between these stated values and can be determined with the formulas introduced above.
The formula also makes it clear that, in addition to the duration of the time delays of
following cars, it is especially speed that determines capacity (Fig. 16.11). With
increasing clearance speeds, capacity grows with autonomous trafﬁc at a higher rate than
that of trafﬁc with human drivers. If it is possible, therefore, to achieve faster departure
times and clearance with autonomous driving, as well as shorter time delays, then a
signiﬁcantly higher capacity gain than the 40 % named above can be expected.
16.3.3 Assessing the Efficiency Gains from Autonomous Driving
Estimates of the effect of autonomous vehicles on capacity as a measure of the efﬁciency
of transport systems show signiﬁcant potential for increasing trafﬁc ﬂow, both on some
sections of highways and intersections of major urban roads.
330
B. Friedrich
Incitytrafﬁc,acapacity increaseof about40 % couldbeachievedwithpurelyautonomous
trafﬁc, while capacities could be increased on highway sections by about 80 %. The signif-
icant difference in the growth potential is due to the average speed at which vehicles drive
when using the trafﬁc infrastructure. This is clear from Fig. 16.7, which shows a dispro-
portionateincreaseincapacityintherangeoflower speedsandaﬂattening-outtowardshigher
speeds.When capacity is reached, the speeds on highways are about 80 km/ h. On urban main
roads, the platoon starting at green, which determines capacity at signal lights, moves at an
average of 20 km/h. Because of this difference in speeds, autonomous vehicles have a very
different impact on the capacity of transportation infrastructure elements.
In addition to the capacity level achievable by including autonomous vehicles, the
stability of the trafﬁc ﬂow at high trafﬁc volumes is important. In city trafﬁc at a capacity
utilization of 70–80 %, there is admittedly a constant trafﬁc backlog before the relevant
trafﬁc signal, which is why it is no longer possible to drive through without stopping
(green wave) at high trafﬁc loads. Nevertheless, there will be a drop in capacity, as is the
case in extra-urban trafﬁc, especially on highways. To this extent, the stability of trafﬁc
ﬂow is not compromised on the urban road network until it reaches full capacity—and
only then when an overload causes blockages at the intersections.
16.4
Conclusion and Outlook
16.4.1 Traffic
This analysis, with the help of the macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow models, shows that, in prin-
ciple, a signiﬁcant increase in capacity can be expected from using autonomous vehicles
and that this would also enable a more efﬁcient use of the existing transport infrastructure.
Along with the expected increase in capacity for existing trafﬁc infrastructure, trafﬁc jams
and lost time are reduced, which in turn improve the quality of trafﬁc ﬂow. In particular,
two factors are responsible for the increase in capacity:
Fig. 16.11 Capacities for a
single lane at a traffic signal in
relation to clearance speed
16
The Effect of Autonomous Vehicles on Traffic
331
(a) One factor is the shortening of headways between autonomous vehicles. In this
context, it is signiﬁcant that ride comfort is maintained, despite the short time gaps,
by anticipating the actions of the preceding vehicles and thereby enabling lower
acceleration or deceleration. This could also be important for column stability. The
intercommunication of vehicles and infrastructure appears to be an important pre-
requisite for this.
(b) In addition to the duration of the time gap, the speed of the vehicle group is very
important. The higher the speed at a constant density, the higher the trafﬁc volume
over a cross section. However, achieving high speeds while maintaining trafﬁc
density is possible only in purely autonomous trafﬁc. A single human-driven vehicle
in the column would lead to slower speeds and reduce the capacity gain.
16.4.2 Infrastructure
The models developed for trafﬁc ﬂow and capacity, assuming a given share of autono-
mous vehicles, show that capacity increases disproportionately highly as the share of
autonomous vehicles increases. It should be noted that the shortening of the time gaps
comes into effect as early as the ﬁrst autonomous vehicle; the speed increase at high
densities, however, will only be possible for purely autonomous trafﬁc. The introduction
of autonomous vehicles will succeed, in the opinion of the author, only in their ability to
move safely in mixed trafﬁc, as reserved transit areas would not be socially or econom-
ically acceptable, particularly with a low share of autonomous trafﬁc.
However, once a sufﬁcient number of vehicles with autonomous capabilities are par-
ticipating in trafﬁc, it will be very beneﬁcial to the transport efﬁciency to create reserved
lanes for autonomous driving. The beneﬁts of autonomous vehicles can be maximized by
separation due to the nonlinear course of the capacity once nonautonomous vehicles are
added to autonomous trafﬁc. In conjunction with specially dedicated lanes, the column
speed could also be increased even when trafﬁc demand is higher, which would lead to
further signiﬁcant capacity gains. This is not possible in mixed trafﬁc, since even in trafﬁc
with only a few human-driven vehicles, these would dictate the speed.
In an initial analysis of this far-reaching subject, this article has solely focused on the
trafﬁc effects of autonomous vehicles on sections of motorways and, with an eye to urban
trafﬁc, at intersections with trafﬁc lights. These two driving situations to a large extent
determine the quality of the trafﬁc ﬂow. However, there are a number of other relevant
driving situations that may have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the capacity of the overall system:
(a) Outside of urban areas, these are the entry, merging and exit maneuvers at the inter-
sections of major roads. Firstly, we can look forward here to further developing
already-emerging technical solutions with assistance functions, such as the merging
assistant, particularly in regard to the possibilities of machine cooperation. Secondly,
solutions for structural and regulatory adjustments to transportation facilities are still to
be developed. For example, one interesting scenario is where autonomous trafﬁc is
332
B. Friedrich
directed onto separate lanes between motorway intersections. This separation is then
removed
in
intersection
areas.
In
an
intersection
area,
autonomous
and
human-controlled vehicles thus drive in all lanes and each may perform all maneuvers
(autonomous, highly assisted or human-driven) at a perhaps predetermined low speed.
(b) Within urban areas, there are still issues regarding the impact of the so-called conditional
compatibility that have to be clariﬁed. Conditional compatibility occurs when different
trafﬁc ﬂows crossing at trafﬁc signals are given the green light, requiring rules of right of
way to be adhered to. This, for example, is the case in trafﬁc ﬂows turning right or left,
which must grant right of way to pedestrians and cyclists travelling parallel to the trafﬁc.
Variousapproachescouldbeinterestingforthispurposeandshouldbesubjectedtocloser
scrutiny. Thus, one could give the green light to all lanes of autonomous vehicles
simultaneously in a separate phase—the maneuvers of the conﬂicting ﬂows in the
intersection area would be negotiated independently by the autonomous vehicles. All
other road users would be controlled by the existing signaling. Another possible solution
would be to consider cyclists and pedestrians in a separate phase with “all green”, thus
maximizing vehicle-ﬂow compatibility by using an appropriate phase structure.
16.4.3 Cooperation
For scenarios such as this last, where trafﬁc at intersections is self-organizing, autonomous
vehicles need to be able to communicate among themselves and with the infrastructure.
Anticipating the maneuvers of moving vehicles ahead, and the reactions in the next
column that depend on this, results in a comfortable and thus acceptable rate of accel-
eration, also ensuring the experience of travelling in the vehicle is pleasant. For this
reason, currently existing technologies for communication and cooperation will play an
important role in the development of autonomous driving.

Safety Benefits of Automated Vehicles:
Extended Findings from Accident
Research for Development, Validation
and Testing
Thomas Winkle
17.1
Introduction
Advancing vehicle automation promises new opportunities to better meet society’s future
mobility demands. New, extended concepts for interaction with machines are arising in
certain areas [1]. A prerequisite for this is further technological development of assistance
systems with more capable sensor and information technologies, allowing for a steady
automation of driving tasks in vehicle control, right up to self-driving vehicles [2].
Initially the following meta-analysis documents exemplary investigation of potential
safety-enhancing vehicle systems with low degrees of automation. However, a safety
prognosis of highly or fully automated vehicles depends on assumptions, as so far no
series applications of such features exist. For testing methods in order to develop and
validate safe automated vehicles with reasonable expenditure, the author recommends
combining area-wide trafﬁc, accident, weather, and vehicle operation data as well as trafﬁc
simulations. Based on these ﬁndings, a realistic evaluation of internationally and statis-
tically relevant real world trafﬁc scenarios as well as error processes and stochastic models
can be analyzed (in combination with virtual tests in laboratories and driving simulators)
to control critical driving situations in the future.

17.1.1 Motivation
In terms of advancing automation, automobile manufacturers have been offering active
steering-assistance systems (Lane Keeping Assistance Systems—LKAS) in combination
with adaptive cruise control for series production vehicles since as far back as the turn of
the millenium. The combined functionality was available on the Japanese market for
right-hand drive vehicles such as the Nissan Cima (2001) and the Honda Inspire (2003).
When using both assistance systems, short-term, partially automated driving (see
Sect. 17.1.2) of up to 20 seconds was possible under the supervision of the driver (au-
thor’s test drives in 2003). Since 2008, German manufacturers, starting with the VW
Passat CC, have also been selling active steering systems optionally in selected models
[3]. Opportunities for greater trafﬁc safety increase with rising vehicle automation. Further
market penetration of standard equipped safety-enhancing driver-assist systems will lead
to a further reduction in road accidents (see p. 344, Sect. 17.4.1).
According to ﬁgures from the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce of Germany, 3475 people were
killed in road accidents in Germany in 2015 [4]. On average around nine people a day lose
their lives in this way on German roads alone. Among these accidents are some that can be
prevented by automated vehicles in future. A potential safety beneﬁt can be determined on
the basis of accident data. The examples given in this article demonstrate the possibilities
and limits of analyzing this data. What is meant here by potential safety beneﬁts is the
predicted fall in accident-related damage. Prerequisites in order to determine speciﬁc
potential safety beneﬁts are basic assumptions about the overall trafﬁc situation and about
the proportion of automated driven mileage with its corresponding functional limits.
Trafﬁc accident research is carried out worldwide by various organizations. Their
research encompasses the subﬁelds of accident surveys/-statistics, accident reconstruction,
and accident analysis [5]. Accident investigation, carried out by the police in all federal
states, forms the basis for accident research in Germany. Furthermore, other institutions
such as the Trafﬁc Accident Research Institute of TU Dresden GmbH (Verkehrsunfall-
forschung, or VUFO) and the Hannover Medical School, as well as vehicle manufacturers
and the German insurance industry, all carry out their own accident research. Central to
this is investigating accidents directly at the scene, statistically recording and analyzing
them according to certain characteristics, and, where needed, using this to further develop
future vehicle automation. Regarding automated vehicles’ potential safety beneﬁts, the
following elaboration exemplarily demonstrates potentials, limits of ﬁndings and predic-
tions given by accident-data collections.
The following questions will be discussed, using speciﬁc examples from accident
research:
– What signiﬁcance do analyzes and ﬁndings from road-accident research hold for the
introduction of automated vehicles?
– How can the potential safety beneﬁts of automated vehicles be established?

17.1.2 Categorizing the Levels of Driving Automation
Three categories for levels of driving automation (concerning the degree of vehicle
guidance) are outlined brieﬂy below, and will later be used as examples to illustrate the
potentials and limits of accident data analysis. For use in subsequent sections here the
categorization of the previous BASt-project group “Legal consequences of an increase in
vehicle automation” [6] published in 2012 is sufﬁcient. These ﬁve degrees of automation
begin with the original conventional vehicle guidance, termed “driver only”, where the
driver is permanently responsible for the vehicle’s longitudinal and lateral motion. The
gradations continue with driver assistance (“assisted”) and partial automation (“partially
automated”), with constant driver supervision at all times. Lastly, the levels of high
automation (“highly automated”) and full automation (“fully automated”) permit humans
to stay out of the vehicle-guidance process some or all of the time [6].
Another ﬁve levels were also deﬁned by the American NHTSA agency [7]. Subse-
quently the SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, developed
further six distinctions, as described in its J 3016 informational report. They are being
increasingly used in today’s research projects. These levels correspond precisely to the
BASt levels published previously in 2012, with two key differences. First, the names are
different. Second, SAE adds level 5 (full automation), at which the automated driving
system performs the entire dynamic driving task under all conditions that can be managed
by a human driver [8] (see below Fig. 17.1).
17.2
Accident Data Collections to Demonstrate Potential
Safety Benefits
According to accident statistics, a fatal road accident occurs on average:
– every 2.7 h in Germany
– every 25 min (ca. 34,000 annually) in the USA
– every 26 s (at least 1,240,000 annually) worldwide [4, 9, 10].
Since the early 1970s, measures taken in road building, legislation, the rescue chain,
emergency medicine, and passive and active vehicle safety have lowered the numbers of

injuries and fatalities in road accidents considerably in Western countries. This ﬁnding is
based on large-scale worldwide collected surveys and analyzes of road accidents with
various orientations, amount of data and from surveys of varying depth. Selected
accident-data collections that exemplify on automated vehicles’ potential safety beneﬁts
will now be introduced, along with their respective pros and cons.
17.2.1 Federal Road-Traffic Accident Statistics in Germany
In accordance with Section 1 of the StVUnfStatG (§1, German law on statistics of road
trafﬁc accidents) from 1990, the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce of Germany in Wiesbaden
publishes monthly federal statistics on fatalities, injuries, and property damage. All police
stations are obliged to submit deﬁned records of reported accidents, and to pass on
information from trafﬁc accident reports to state-level statistics ofﬁces [4].
The nationwide statistical data is published regularly on the Internet. The cause of
accident determined by police investigation, which essentially evaluates drivers’ driving
errors, shows the potential for automated driving (see p. 344, Sect. 17.4.1.1; p. 351,
Sect. 17.4.3.2). All documented information is subdivided into clear categories, e.g. type
of road, age of all parties including the people causing the accident, and type of transport
means. There is no speciﬁc documentation on accident reconstruction, injuries or vehicle
details available.
17.2.2 German In-depth Accident Study (GIDAS)
Extensive data is required for the detailed and statistically reliable analysis of
road-accident scenarios. In Germany, the database of GIDAS (German In-Depth Accident
Study) is qualiﬁed for many of these purposes. Nationally and internationally recognized,
it is considered one of the most comprehensive and signiﬁcant accident databases in the
world [5, 11]. In-depth analysis at the accident location follows an incidence of personal
injury involving any type of vehicle, and has been supported in Germany by the Federal
Highway Research Institute (BASt) since 1973 and the Research Association of Auto-
motive Technology (FAT) since 1999. Today, the GIDAS project anonymizes and places
in a separate database some 2000 accidents annually, with up to 3000 coded parameters,
from the survey areas of Hannover (since 1973) and Dresden (since 1999). Each docu-
mented accident contains information on the environment (e.g. weather, road type, road
condition, environment), the situation (e.g. trafﬁc situation, conﬂict situation, and type and
manner of accident), the vehicles (type, safety equipment), and personal and injury data
including a sketch of the accident with reconstruction and image data [5, 11, 12].
The beneﬁts of the GIDAS data are based on in-depth analyses with several types of
vehicles causing injury to persons, the related accident site, and the ﬁeld of medicine. To
aid further analysis, many cases are reconstructed and simulated electronically to a high
338
T. Winkle
level of detail with the PC-Crash simulation software from the Austrian company
DSD-Datentechnik www.dsd.at [13]. One disadvantage lies in the fact that data access is
limited to car manufacturers and component suppliers taking part in the project. The
investigation criteria only include accidents involving injuries. Although only the Han-
nover and Dresden areas are surveyed, the results are transferable to the whole of Ger-
many via extrapolation (in technical terms: weighting and comparison with ofﬁcial
accident statistics, see Sect. 17.2.1).
17.2.3 Road-Traffic Accident Statistics in the USA
In the USA, the National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been
consistently documenting every fatal road accident since 1975 using the Fatality Analysis
Reporting System (FARS) [9]. Furthermore, the National Automotive Sample System—
Crashworthiness Data System (Nass-CDS) has existed in the USA since 1979 [14]. The
program analyzes road accidents involving personal injury or severe property damage
using interdisciplinary teams, similarly to the German GIDAS project.
In-depth data collections for extended accident analysis can also be found in the USA,
although, unlike GIDAS, they offer no reliable accident reconstruction. For example, it is
not possible to assess emergency braking functions [11]. Accident risks in the USA differ,
e.g. due to the longer distances driven. The drop in US trafﬁc accident fatalities since 1970
is lower, at around 16 %, than in Germany, at around 60 % [4, 9].
17.2.4 Road-Accident Data in Asia, Taking the Examples of China
and India
Trafﬁc accident data collection in Asia is still in its initial stages. Analysis is superﬁcial
and permits no reliable reconstruction. While initial approaches to reliable data collection
have been made in China, the number of trafﬁc accident fatalities is not even recorded in
India [11].
17.2.5 International Road-Accident Data Collections
The International Road Trafﬁc and Accident Database (IRTAD) consists of a collection of
various national ofﬁcial accident statistics. It includes road accidents involving personal
injury generally as well as fatalities—distinguished by age, location and type of road
use—and is maintained by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) in Paris. Besides the countries bordering Germany, it contains data from: Aus-
tralia, Canada, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxem-
bourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the UK
and the USA [10].

The data is publicly accessible on the Internet and especially suited to comparing the
data between countries included. It is possible to study the impact of various regulations
and collective driving behavior (north vs. south, for instance). In-depth information on the
details as to how the accident occurred is still lacking, however. Moreover, survey
methods and data volumes vary from country to country.
Another initiating action for harmonisation of global in-depth trafﬁc accident data is the
Initiative for the Global Harmonisation of Accident Data (IGLAD). IGLAD was initiated
in 2010 by European car manufacturers to improve road and vehicle safety. The database
contains accident data according to a standardised data scheme. This should enable
comparison between datasets from different countries. The ﬁrst phase of the project was
funded by the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association (ACEA). The growing
data set of the second phase, which started 2014, contains 93 variables regarding the
accidents, roads, participants, occupants and safety systems. Limited data (between 50 and
200 cases, data years 2007–2012) from each of 11 countries (Australia, Austria, China,
Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Italy, Spain, Sweden and USA) are available for
research.
17.2.6 Accident-Data Collections of Auto Manufacturers
In order to collect ﬁndings on accidents involving current vehicles, and to fulﬁll product
monitoring obligations, interdisciplinary expert teams from car manufacturers and com-
ponent suppliers today carry out accident analysis at the scene together with hospitals and
the police. The results primarily serve continuing improvements in the effectiveness of
vehicle safety systems currently in use.
Moreover, the analysis of accident incidents by the manufacturer serves in complying
with mandatory duty of care and observing potential product dangers that may arise
during use. According to Section 823 of the German code of civil law (BGB), an auto
manufacturer is liable for errors of its products’ consequential damages arising from
intended or foreseeable use by the driver or other persons. A car manufacturer must
therefore collect and analyze information on vehicle use and innovative systems. The
more dangerous a product is, the greater the obligation to protect and monitor a product’s
safety in and after the development process [15], (see Chaps. 21, 23 and 28).
Among the car manufacturers Mercedes-Benz (now: Daimler AG) began investigating
road accidents involving its Mercedes vehicles together with the police of the district of
Böblingen as far back as the late 1960s. Two years later, Mercedes’ accident research had,
with ministerial permission, access to regular telephonic information and insight into the
accident ﬁles of the police in Baden-Württemberg. Since at least the 1970s, other man-
ufacturers such as BMW have been studying and recording collisions involving their own
vehicles on a larger scale. Volkswagen began cooperating with the insurers association
Haftpﬂicht-, Unfall-, Kraftversicherer-Verband (HUK-Verband) in the late 1960s and with
340
T. Winkle
the Hannover Medical School MHH (the predecessor of GIDAS) starting from 1985.
Volkswagen has been recording its own data since 1995 [11].
In-depth, interdisciplinary analysis of accidents by car manufacturers involving new
types of vehicles with the latest safety technology and especially involving function
developers enable clear insights into the potential beneﬁts of driver-assistance systems.
However, around a few hundred cases per year exclusively involving a brand’s own
vehicles are not comparable with GIDAS data in terms of their statistical validity.
17.2.7 Accident Data of the German Insurance Association
The
German
Insurance
Association
(Gesamtverband
der
Deutschen
Ver-
sicherungswirtschaft—GDV), the successor organization of the HUK-Verband, has at its
disposal documented information on incidences of damage from motor claims of German
insurers where compensations for damages based on contracts were paid. These data
beneﬁt the GDV for example in grading insurance contracts, or in determining the
potential safety beneﬁts of driver-assistance systems [16].
Accident research by insurers has access to all cases of motor-vehicle liability losses
reported with the GDV. Unfortunately, the data are not open to the public. Accident
analysis does not take place at the scene and the accident-recording criteria are not
comprehensive. Moreover, the insurer’s interest in the particularities of a case ends as
soon as it sees liability to pay. This therefore means that there is only little detailed
information on the cause of undisputed cases. In single-vehicle accidents with only one
party involved, such as so-called driving accidents, when a driver loses control of the
vehicle, there is mostly no data available on the cause [11].
17.2.8 Accident-Data Collections of Consumer Associations (ADAC)
ADAC (the German automobile club) has been carrying out accident research since 2005.
It is a cooperation project between ADAC air rescue and the ADAC technology center.
From rescue ﬂights, information on around 2500 severe accidents nationally is collected in
the ADAC database annually. The accident data is sourced from the police, doctors, ﬁre
service, and motor-vehicle assessors [17].
The ADAC accident data contains information on road accidents with seriously injured
persons. They include aerial pictures with a vehicle’s ﬁnal position and a detailed medical
diagnosis. Supplementary individual assessment is possible using the ﬁles, although the
data is not publicly accessible. There is no concluding interdisciplinary reﬂection with the
respective persons investigating the accident.

The Fundamentals of Accident-Data Analysis
17.3.1 Level of Data Collection Versus Number of Cases
The validity of accident data regarding potential safety beneﬁts varies considerably
depending on the collection method. In-depth surveys are mostly carried out in cooper-
ation with qualiﬁed interdisciplinary teams. Particularly well-founded results are achiev-
able
when
function
developers,
accident
analysis
experts,
doctors,
and
trafﬁc
psychologists work together on analyzing individual cases. But this level of data col-
lection is usually restricted to a low number of cases, hampering its statistical validity.
Evaluations from accident databases indicate which measures are needed to increase
trafﬁc safety. A detailed accident analysis including an accident reconstruction encom-
passes a retrograde calculation of speeds from traces of the accident, an investigation into
how the accident arose, a check for accident fraud, consideration of how avoidable it was,
and biomechanics. An evaluation of future systems’ potential beneﬁts based on this
requires extensive knowledge of the given conditions and framework.
Until now, forward-thinking ideas on improving vehicle safety have primarily come
from combining accident analysis, existing experience and extensive research work.
Accident research is one way to determine the efﬁciency of existing automated vehicle
functions and the need for new safety-enhancing ones. In what follows, basic terms of
accident-data evaluation are explained.
17.3.2 The Validity of Areas of Action Compared to Areas
of Efficiency
When comparing various accident-data analyses, both the way in which data is collected
and the way it is processed must be distinguished. Frequently, areas of action adopted
under optimal conditions are confused with areas of efﬁciency under real conditions.
An area of action covers the accidents that a system can inﬂuence. The area of action
can vary depending on how precise a system’s speciﬁcation is deﬁned. As a result it is an
initial estimation for the maximum achievable potential of the regarded level of
automation. The actual resulting efﬁciency of a function, on the other hand, is usually
signiﬁcantly lower. Efﬁciency here is the effect that a speciﬁed system actually has. It is
either proved in the occurrence of accidents (a posteriori) or predicted by a simulation (a
priori).
Determining an area of efﬁciency thus demands precise knowledge of two factors:
– the system speciﬁcation with its corresponding function limits
– the driver’s behavior.
The degree of efﬁciency describes a function’s relative efﬁciency as a percentage and is
always dependent on the unspeciﬁed term of the area of action [18]:

ð17:1Þ
17.3.3 Potential Safety Benefits Depending on the Level
of Automation and Degree of Efficiency
Some analyses of potential safety impacts using accident databases examine the maximum
assumed area of action described above. In contrast, analyzing the degree of efﬁciency
comes closer to reality by assessing an area of efﬁciency for its actual beneﬁt [18]. The
resulting safety beneﬁts of automated vehicles only arise, though, after all risks have been
taken into consideration. The beneﬁt complies with the reduction of accident frequency
and severity. New risks exist in terms of as-yet nonexistent accidents that may arise with
increasing automation.
The theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) deﬁnes the requirements of an ideal
machine by the formula of an ideal ﬁnal result with an unlimited beneﬁt without costs and
damages [19]:
ideal final result ¼
P benefit
P costs þ P damages
ð
Þ ¼
1
ð0 þ 0Þ ¼ 1
ð17:2Þ
On the one hand, when looking at the actual total consumer-relevant potential as
regards the safety beneﬁt of automated vehicles, this increases in accordance with the
degree of efﬁciency up to the maximum area of efﬁciency (proof by accident data analysis
and knowledge of functions). On the other hand, the risks may increase in line with the
level of automation (“Driver” vs. “Robot”). These in turn reduce the actual safety beneﬁt
(see Fig. 17.2). To minimize potential risks, manufacturers carry out risk management
(see Chap. 28) that takes accident data into account.
Fig. 17.2 Consumers evaluate the potential safety benefits subjectively by weighting up the
perceived risks and benefits in the relevant contexts. Risks depend on the level of automation,
benefits on the degree of efficiency. Accident-data analysis and risk management (see Chap. 28)
allow for objectivation (see Chap. 30) and optimization. Image rights: Author

Significance of Possible Predictions Based
on Accident Data
Using examples, the following meta-analysis shows what is and is not possible when
drawing conclusions about potential beneﬁts on the basis of various accident data. As
there is no existing experience of analyzing highly and fully automated vehicles, systems
without automation (“driver only”/“no automation”) or with low levels of automation
referring to the main driving task (“assisted”/“partially automated”) are considered ﬁrst,
divided into a-posteriori- and a-priori-analyzes.
Section 17.4.1 describes examples of a-posteriori-statements on accident data collected
so far. In the deﬁnition used here, ﬁgures “gained from experience” [20] can be used
directly for interpretations. In contrast, the a-priori-forecasts deﬁned in Sect. 17.4.2 are
based on accident-data collections to assess the potential beneﬁts of future levels of
automation, exclusively using assumptions “obtained by logical reasoning” [20].
17.4.1 A-Posteriori-Analyzes of Accident Data for “Driver Only”/
“No Automation”
Past and present a-posteriori-analyzes of accident-data collections with conventionally
(human-) driven vehicles form the basis for direct insights into accident black spots and
changes in real-life trafﬁc accidents. In this “driver-only”/ “no-automation” category, there
are neither warnings nor interventions in longitudinal and lateral guidance on the basis of
environmental sensors.
To illustrate this, the change in the numbers of accident deaths serves as one example
(see Sect. 17.4.1.1), the impact of Electric Stability Control, or ESC, is another (see
Sect. 17.4.1.2).
17.4.1.1
Traffic Statistics: Accident Fatalities Versus Registered
Motor Vehicles
One example of what currently available accident data can show is the relationship of
trafﬁc accident deaths to vehicles registered, taken from data of the German Federal
Statistics Ofﬁce. This demonstrates that numbers have been dropping in Germany since
the dramatic ﬁgure of 21,332 trafﬁc accident fatalities in 1970 [4].
In short, the accident data shows that the number of trafﬁc fatalities dropped from over
21,000 in 1970 to almost 3000 per year—at the same time as increases in registered
vehicles occurred. The multifarious causes of this lie in the area of various legislative,
technological, medical, and infrastructural measures (see Fig. 17.3). The overlapping of
all safety measures makes it difﬁcult to prove the effectiveness of any single potential
safety beneﬁt.

17.4.1.2
Studies on the Effect of “Driver-Only”/“No-Automation”
Systems
Electronic Stability Control, or ESC, introduced in 1995, is technically built up on
anti-lock braking, or ABS, introduced in 1978. It uses that system’s wheel speed sensors
together with additional sensors for yaw rate, steering wheel angle, and lateral accelera-
tion. Using the information from these sensors, ESC tries to stabilize the vehicle in case of
a recognized skid by independently braking individual wheels. With this braking inter-
vention, ESC can convert a lateral collision into a less vulnerable frontal crash. In 2001,
Daimler accident research assumed that 21 % of skid accidents resulted in injuries and
43 % in fatalities [21]. The ﬁndings of accident-research experts investigating individual
cases on behalf of vehicle manufacturers diverged greatly at that time. Later predictions of
potential beneﬁts based on larger amounts of data also differ. Areas of action from the year
2000, for instance, show a positive impact of up to 67 % for severe accidents due to
skidding [22]. Other studies found that ESC provides the second-most effective increase in
safety in the “driver-only” category, after the introduction of safety belts as a passive
safety system [2]. The proportion of accidents caused by driver-error and skidding, for
example, fell after the introduction of ESC as a standard in all Mercedes-Benz cars from
about 2.8 involved cars (per 1000 registered in Germany) in 1998/1999 to 2.21 involved
in 2000/2001. ESC’s high effectiveness could also be veriﬁed in other car brands such as
Volkswagen, where accident statistics show lower accident frequency and prevention of
especially critical accident types [22].
In summary, safety beneﬁts can already be proven today for safety-enhancing
“driver-only” functions with quick market penetration depending on various data sources
and suppositions. Particularly for ESC, safety impacts can be well-founded scientiﬁcally
veriﬁed.

17.4.2 A-Priori-Forecasts for Assisted and Partially
Automated Driving
A-priori-forecasts are tied to hypotheses and inferences. Assisted and partially automated
driving functions, for example, can save the driver from imminent danger via optic,
acoustic or haptic warnings or short braking or steering interventions with a warning
character. A prerequisite for successfully averting danger, however, is the assumption that
the driver will react in time and appropriately to the trafﬁc situation.
From a technical point of view, these advanced levels of automation—with extended
computer and sensor technology for environmental perception—allow for increasingly
capable assistance systems. Some safety-enhancing driver assistance systems on the
market today give warnings when there is recognized danger in parallel and crossing
trafﬁc. These include collision warning systems as EBA—Electronic Brake Assist, ACC
with FCWS—Adaptive Cruise Control with Forward Collision Warning System, LCA—
Lane Keep Assist, LDW—Lane Departure Warning, NV—Night Vision or intersection
assistance. Other systems intervene in the longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, such
as Electronic Brake Assist (EBA) or Autonomous Emergency Brake (AEB), (see
Fig. 17.3).
17.4.2.1
Study on the Potential of Lane Departure Warning
One approach to analyzing road accidents together with doctors, psychologists and
development engineers was introduced in 2006, using the example of a Lane Departure
Warning (LDW) system [24]. The results, achieved with the participation of the author of
this paper, a psychologist, and a function developer, were based on an interdisciplinary
research community between a car manufacturer, a university hospital, and the police,
with support from the Bavarian Ministry of the Interior, Building and Transport (BStMI).
Such interdisciplinary analyzes of accident causes and consequences include exam-
ining the technical, medical, and psychological details by experts from each ﬁeld, then
integrating all results collectively. Today, for instance, driving-related psychological data
is increasingly collected to analyze a road accident. Using standardized interviews, the
experience of a collision is recorded and evaluated from the driver’s point of view.
Technical reconstruction of the accident is supplemented by a trafﬁc-related psychological
perspective.
In coordination between the professional teams, taking the example of Lane Departure
Warning, it was explained what speciﬁcations of the system design had to be met. Speciﬁc
focused questions from the technological development allow the selected accidents to be
ﬁltered further. This gives insight into the accident-avoidance potential of the systems
under development. For this purpose, knowledge of the system’s speciﬁc technical limits
is crucial. Recommendations for further functional system enhancements are also possible
[24].
In conclusion, these detailed accident analyzes show the beneﬁt of comprehensive
accident-data collection. Within this study, experts on technology, medicine, and
346
T. Winkle
psychology were closely interconnected. The interdisciplinary approach delivers numer-
ous additional references in terms of vehicle details, accident scenes, parties involved in
accident, injury patterns and witness statements. This extra information provides insight
into active steering corrections, interventions of the brakes and reactions immediately
preceding a collision, as human errors such as fatigue, inattentiveness or distraction are the
main causes of lane departure. Various directions from which an interdisciplinary team
analyzes the accident allow the computer-aided reconstruction and simulation of an
incident to be highly realistic. To determine representative ﬁndings from this, however, it
is necessary to validate it with larger accident-data collections.
17.4.2.2
Interdisciplinary Degree of Efficiency Analysis Based
on Current Driver Assistance Systems
Building on the advantages of interdisciplinary analysis of the effectiveness of Lane
Departure Warning, a further interdisciplinary degree-of-efﬁciency analysis was carried
out four years later. The objective was to compare available safety-enhancing
driver-assistance systems which were available on the market. This study used a sam-
ple of reconstructed accidents (n = 100) in close consultation with the respective function
developers. Therefore an interdisciplinary accident-data evaluation was carried out by the
author together with a psychologist. Regarding accident causes, the driver assistance
systems’ effectiveness at avoiding accidents depending on the situation was analyzed [25].
The range of systems available for study in early 2010 included Night Vision, Lane
Departure Warning, Lane Change Assistant and Adaptive Cruise Control. To establish the
degree of efﬁciency, accident research data, weighted according to accident statistics for
Bavaria, was analyzed. In the process, real-life accidents were compared with the
reconstructed accident scene, and the accident cause was assessed in terms of
human-machine interaction. This was done in line with the human-machine interactions
described in the ADAS Code of Practice for the development of Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems (ADAS) with active longitudinal- and lateral guidance [26]. After
many years of preparation [27, 28] it was published by the European Automobile Man-
ufacturer’s Association (Association des Constructeurs Européens d’Automobiles—
ACEA) in 2009 [29]. The potential for preventing accidents was only deemed to be
positive if every development expert for the relevant system agreed. The results showed
that the examined systems could signiﬁcantly contribute to reducing the severity of
accidents.
Overall, the study predicts that the investigated driver assistance systems would pos-
itively impact accident prevention, with a 27 % drop in the total number of injured
persons. The number of injured would thus be reduced from 126 drivers and 49 pas-
sengers to 94 and 33 respectively. It should be kept in mind that the results assume
optimal reactions in terms of human-machine-interactions. This would need to be veriﬁed
by studies with test persons before drawing ﬁnal conclusions. Further, 100 % distribution
of the systems, operating error-free within the system limits, would have to be assured.
17

The injury grading adopted was based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) [30], as
also used in ISO 26262 for functional safety [31]. The AIS codes every injury to the
human body with a numerical value between 1 (light injuries) and 6 (extremely critical or
fatal injuries). The most severe injury of all individual injuries of one person is thus
deﬁned as MAIS (Maximum AIS). An uninjured person is classiﬁed with MAIS 0.
Analyzing accident causes further revealed that more than 60 % of them involved
so-called information errors—malfunctions of information access and information
reception. This explains the correspondingly high effectiveness of warning assistance
systems [25].
In summary, currently available driver assistance systems were compared in an
interdisciplinary study, with the respective developers taking part in the analysis. Each
individual developer knows the speciﬁc relevant function parameters of his system, thus
allowing for more accurate assessments of potential beneﬁts. It has to be noted that the
sample of 100 cases in the area-of-action study, weighted in comparison with represen-
tative accident data from Bavaria, is too small to provide statistically reliable statements
based on the results obtained. However, it is possible to derive a tendency where these
driver assistance systems contribute substantially to road safety.
Attention should be drawn to the fact that there are further options for obtaining
statistical evidence to the forecast safety gains of braking assistance and automatic
emergency braking functions. In addition, there are assessment methods for forecasting
safety beneﬁts based on simulations using software-based accident reconstructions [32].
17.4.2.3
GIDAS Database Analysis for Potential Safety Benefits
of Connected Vehicles
Based on a larger data volume, the following analysis of the German In-Depth Accident
Study (GIDAS) database shows the complexity and variety of several assumptions.
Together with a team of experts, the author carried out this analysis with a more signif-
icant sample in 2009 as part of the Safe and Intelligent Mobility—Test Field Germany
(Sichere Intelligente Mobilität: Testfeld Deutschland—simTD) research project. The
objective of the analysis was to assess the potential beneﬁt of future safety-relevant
vehicle communications systems. Functions for connected systems with a direct safety
impact on road trafﬁc were considered. The underlying data encompassed 13,821 acci-
dents involving personal injury documented by GIDAS from 2001 to 2008 in the areas of
Dresden, Hannover, and their surroundings [12]. To extrapolate this for the whole of
Germany, the data acquired in the statistical sampling scheme was weighted using acci-
dent statistics from the German Federal Statistical Ofﬁce. These ofﬁcial statistics contain
all accidents involving personal injury registered in Germany over the calendar year. In
2007, for instance, there were 335,845 road accidents involving personal injury [4].
The variables needed for the analysis were precisely deﬁned in several consultations
with the simTD function developers and accident experts from Audi, BMW, Bosch,
Daimler and Volkswagen. All project participants agreed to begin by analyzing 13
safety-related warning functions. The participants jointly decided to look at relevant
348
T. Winkle
vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, agricultural tractors, rail vehicles (including trams and
city railways, but no Deutsche Bahn trains) and motorbikes (motorized two-wheelers,
three-wheelers, quad bikes from 125 cc) in the course of several workshops. This was
followed by very intensive work to determine the areas of action using the extensive
GIDAS data. This selection was initially made by taking the variables from all accidents
relevant to each system relating to the complete accident occurrence. It showed that the
areas of action for each individually examined function varied in a wide range between 0.2
and 24.9 %. Areas of action can thus only give an estimation of the maximum effec-
tiveness that cannot be exceeded with great certainty. It should also be noted that it is not
possible to add up individual areas of action, due to their overlapping between functions.
In a subsequent degree of efﬁciency analysis, three assumed function types (electronic
brake light, cross-trafﬁc assist, trafﬁc-sign assist for stop signs) from the GIDAS area of
action analysis described above were selected. The corresponding degrees of efﬁciency
were adopted by using a reduced sample of driving simulator investigations.
For accidents avoided by the driver with cross-trafﬁc assist (see [33]), for example,
there was a sizeable range, from 9.9 to 73.3 %. This results from both varying driver
reaction times and different braking intensity upon warnings. Therefore, three reaction
times (0.54, 0.72 and 1.06 s) and the respective probabilities of their occurrence were
determined. Furthermore, in the cases of unsuccessful reactions, weak braking of 50 % of
maximum braking pressure was assumed and 100 % for successful reactions [12].
In summary, this sophisticated approach to analyzing degrees of efﬁciency was aimed
at determining and evaluating with statistical relevance the potential of future, connected,
safety-enhancing driver-assist functions. The range between 10 % and 70 % that was
found, however, diminishes the validity and thus only permits tendencies and outlooks
concerning accidents avoided. This wide scattering is rooted in the sensitivity of the
parameters descried above and the warning algorithm in question, as drivers’ reaction
times and braking intensities differ greatly in practice.
17.4.3 Potential Safety Benefits and Test Scenarios
for Development of Highly and Fully Automated Driving
17.4.3.1
GIDAS Databased Expert Estimates until 2070
From a technical point of view, automated vehicles today can already autonomously take
over many driving tasks in moving trafﬁc under favorable conditions. While driver
assistance systems support the driver, the advanced systems like highly and fully auto-
mated driving temporarily or permanently take over the driving tasks.
Among others highly and, particularly, fully automated driving is designed to approach
“Vision Zero”. The aim is to travel as accident-free and effectively as possible. Roads and
means of transportation should be designed in such a way that no person is killed or
severely injured. The vision of being accident-free has its origins in occupational safety
and was ﬁrst applied to road trafﬁc in Sweden in the 1990s. The EU has supported projects
17
Safety Benefits of Automated Vehicles …
349
for automated vehicles such as the “Highly Automated VEhicles for intelligent transport”
(HAVEit) research project, which was sponsored by the EU with 17 million Euros. Car
manufacturers such as BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen/Audi are also working on visions
of accident-free driving. Prof. Dr. Thomas Weber, member of the Board of Management
of Daimler AG for research and development, explains in an interview:
Unser Weg zum unfallfreien Fahren treibt uns an, die Mobilität auch in Zukunft für alle
Verkehrsteilnehmer so sicher wie möglich zu gestalten. [21]
(Our ‘path to accident-free driving’ also drives us to design mobility as safely as possible
for all road users in the future.)
The number of road accidents involving personal injury with a car as the main cause
fell in Germany in the ﬁrst decade of this century, from 266,885 in 2001 to 198,175 in
2010. According to the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce (2010), cars are the main cause of road
accidents, at 68.7 %. The accident types mainly break down into the following categories:
Turning at/Crossing intersections (58,725), Parallel trafﬁc (44,812), Turning (33,649) and
30,737 Dynamic accidents [4] (see Fig. 17.4).
Until now, there has been no empirical proof of the overall safety gains of fully
automated driving functions. One of the ﬁrst comprehensive forecasting models in
vehicle-safety and accident research was published by Daimler. It investigated automated
vehicles’ potential for accident prevention by means of assumed deployment and market
penetration scenarios. These were based on expert estimates, third-party forecasts and
GIDAS data. The forecast, which is able to provide an initial rough estimate, is based on a
total of 198,175 preventable collisions caused by cars in 2010 (see Fig. 17.4). The
assumptions involve changes within each accident type (Parallel trafﬁc, Stationary trafﬁc,
Pedestrians, Turning at/Crossing intersections, Turning, Dynamic accidents). It can be
seen, for example, that accidents involving a car losing control or in parallel trafﬁc will fall
by around 15 % by 2060 with increasing automation, while accidents when turning at or
crossing intersections will proportionately increase by around 10 % [34].

According to these estimates for increased automation, an overall reduction of 10 % of
accidents would be achievable by 2020. In years thereafter, reductions would be
achievable of 19 % by 2030, 23 % by 2040, 50 % by 2050, 71 % by 2060 and almost
total prevention by 2070 [34]. The forecast thus indicates that a car in 2070 will cause
almost no accidents, but will be able to sustain serious collisions. It can certainly be
assumed that an automated vehicle will be able to avoid some collisions that a third party
would have caused. It has to be kept in mind, however, that this study does not consider
accidents caused by other road users. Potential technical failures (see Fig. 17.6) are also
not included. In addition, the data used from the German Federal Statistical Ofﬁce, and
above all the validity of GIDAS, mainly centers around crash and post-crash statements
with injured people (see [35]).
17.4.3.2
Global Accident Data Evaluation for Relevant Traffic Test
Scenarions
For a complete overall evaluation of highly- and fully automated vehicles’ active safety,
the author would also recommend incorporating ﬁndings concerning worldwide accident
data collections as well as analysis with no harm to people, near collisions, trafﬁc sim-
ulations and weather data. Therefore a ﬁrst-time comprehensive area-wide study based on
all police reports was carried out (see Fig. 17.7). The ﬁndings can be completed with
information from hospitals, insurance companies and models of human behaviour.
Knowing all relevant factors that may lead to a collision, virtual simulations can be
performed based on detailed and quantitative models. Possible system responses can be
classiﬁed in true positive (or negative) and false positive (or negative). The evaluation of
automated safety functions has to consider all possible system responses [36].
The purpose is to comprehensively link up all international known collisions using
geographically deﬁned road-accident data and the accompanying high-deﬁnition geo-
graphic digital mapping data (e.g. Google Maps, Nokia HERE, TomTom, Open-
StreetMap) with trafﬁc data from different sources (e.g. cars, mobile phones, road trafﬁc
devices). Localized accident data in the states of the USA, for example, exist via www.
saferoadmaps.org. Similarly, the British government publishes details on www.data.gov.

In summary, neither reliable speciﬁcations for OEM (Original Equipment Manufac-
turers) mass production solutions ready for market nor concrete information on the
functional limits of highly and fully automated driving are currently available. To date,
therefore, numerous assumptions have had to be made in forecasting potential safety
beneﬁts. Reliable data is also lacking on market launch and penetration. Thus today’s
projections of potential safety beneﬁts, based on accident data, only have limited validity.
It is hence recommended to combine in-depth accident data collections (e.g. GIDAS) with
all worldwide available accident data collections and analyzes, trafﬁc simulations, related
weather information and vehicle operation data (see Fig. 17.5).
The learning curve in Fig. 17.6 shows the increase of available real world data before
and after market launch of automated vehicle functions. To identify relevant critical
scenarios the author recommends monitoring and analyzing all available data of auto-
mated functions regularly. These provide knowledge for sensor simulation, classiﬁcations
and decision strategies of future automated vehicles.

Potential Safety Benefits / Risks and Impacts on Testing
17.5.1 Human Error and Technical Failure in Full Automation
Presuming that most accidents are caused by human error (see Sect. 17.5.2.2) it would
then be almost possible to realize “Vision Zero”, given fault-free fully automated vehicles.
However, technical failure and technical limits are still to be expected—especially in fully
automated self-driving vehicles.
The left side of Fig. 17.7 shows the statistical cause-of-accident distribution, based on
the GIDAS accident database. This accident data show that “human error”, at 93.5 %, is
the main risk of road accidents. The impact of factors involving driving conditions or the
environment—road surface quality or weather, for instance—is relatively low according
to the statistics, at 4.6 %, as is technical failure at 0.7 % [38].
During fully automated driving sections, the number of accidents caused by driver
error is ruled out completely. The “technical failure” category could become propor-
tionally larger, with the new technical risks of fully automated driving. This will lead to
the public giving it greater attention (see Fig. 17.7).

Further assessment and overcoming of human failure-processes in real trafﬁc situations—
in addition to worldwide relevant test scenarios based on comprehensively linked up geo-
graphically deﬁned accident, trafﬁc, weather, and vehicle operation data collections (see
Sect. 17.4.3, Figs. 17.5 and 17.6)—will support virtually trafﬁc simulations for safe
development, tests and validation of automated vehicles in the future [39].
17.5.2 Potential Safety Benefits–Human and Machine Performance
Vehicles’ road safety today essentially depends on the performance of humans supported
by safety-enhancing systems. Fully automated vehicles will only rely on the capabilities of
machines. Depending on the degree of automation, technical systems will replace humans’
perceptions, experience, judgment and capacity to react. Both the potential safety beneﬁts
and risks of increasingly automated vehicle guidance result from the various strengths and
weaknesses of humans and machines.
Machines, for example, cannot react to unknown situations or interpret the movements
of children (see Chap. 20). In comparison, humans can be inattentive, judge distances and
speeds badly and their eyes only see a restricted ﬁeld of vision [29].

be no more human error. However, the proportion of technical faults may be perceived considerably
enlarged in future. Source GIDAS. Image rights: Author

Machine Versus Human Perception Limits and Consequences
for Testing
To illustrate the limited performance of technological perception compared to that of
humans, a heavily simpliﬁed model of currently used sensor technologies is described
below. Sensors are needed for a vehicle to be able to collect information about its
environment, and are classiﬁable according to their physical measuring principle. The
automobile sector mainly uses radar, lidar, near and far infrared, ultrasound sensors, and
cameras. The upper and center image of Fig. 17.8 show simpliﬁed and color-coded the
limited machine perception of individual measuring principles. Compared with this, the
lower image superimposes all these above-named measurements onto what humans per-
ceive among difﬁcult light- and weather conditions (sun, backlight, wet road surface,
spray/splashing water, icing/contamination of windshield/sensors, road markings only
partially visible). Close investigation reveals that the lefthand radar reﬂection point (blue)
is a false detection, caused by a reﬂection in the opposite lane (see [40, 41]).
Figure 17.8 illustrates that the outcome of machine perception and interpretation of
complex trafﬁc situations continues to present development engineers with considerable
technical challenges. These include detecting static and dynamic objects, physically

measuring them as accurately as possible, and allocating the correct semantic meaning to
the detected objects (see Chap. 20).
Difﬁcult light- and weather conditions challenge human and machine perception in real
trafﬁc situations. For this purpose area-wide accident data analyzes (see Sect. 17.4.3.2) are
able to indicate temporally and geographically related accident black spots. To analyze
scenarios considering reduced visibility due to fog, rain, snow, darkness and glare from sun
or headlights, the author carried out a ﬁst-of-its-kind area-wide accident study in cooper-
ation with Christian Erbsmehl from Fraunhofer Institute for Trafﬁc and Infrastructure
Systems (IVI) in Dresden. One ﬁnding of the case-by-case analysis was that in 95 % of all
cases no evasive actions to avoid accidents were documented. Only in 1 % of the cases
drivers were able to reduce the consequences of a collision by evasive maneuvers. Other
evasive maneuvers failed (4 %). Figure 17.9 presents results of this study with relevant
geographical accident scenes for virtual, prooﬁng ground, and ﬁeld tests of automated
vehicles covering all police reports in Saxony from the years 2006 to 2014.

17.5.2.2
Human Error Versus Machine Incertitudes
Advancing vehicle automation of the main driver tasks result in new research questions.
Attentive and vigilant drivers have substantial skills to deescalate dangerous trafﬁc situ-
ations. Human’s capabilities provide signiﬁcant input for trafﬁc safety today. Differenti-
ated potential-beneﬁt estimates would need to compare the performance of humans and
machines. Especially take-over situations between driver and machine involve new
challenges for design and validation of human-machine interaction. Initial tests at the
professorial chair of Klaus Bengler, professor for ergonomics at the Technical University
of Munich (TUM) demonstrate relevant ergonomic design requirements which will be
continued [42].
Fundamental correlations between automation and human performance can be evalu-
ated by many methods. It is possible to identify the probability of a road accident by the
use of a fault tree. Amongst others the probability includes human failure, inappropriate
behavior and the existence of a conﬂicting object [43]. The choice of actions to avoid a
collision is greater if the potential road accident is less imminent.
The evaluation of driver behavior requires observations for a longer period. Regarding
human failures analyzing the perception process chain provides in-depth knowledge. Such
analyzes draw on evaluations of psychological data from road accidents [44]. In terms of
interdisciplinary accident analyzes, an error classiﬁcation of ﬁve categories has been
approved by practical experience in accident research. This ﬁve-steps method is a further
development of ACASS (Accident Causation Analysis with Seven Steps). It was devel-
oped jointly with GIDAS along the lines of the seven-step principle by Jens Rasmussen,
former system safety and human factors professor in Denmark, a highly inﬂuential expert
within the ﬁeld of safety science, human error, risk management and accident research
[45]. Using the ﬁve-steps method it is possible to identify human errors, deﬁne the time
during the perception process from accessing the information to operation, and to evaluate
the particular type of error (see Fig. 17.10). The associated questions concern: Information
Access (was the relevant information of the trafﬁc-situation objectively accessible to the
driver? Was the ﬁeld of vision clear?), Information Reception (did the driver observe the
trafﬁc situation properly and perceive/detect the relevant information subjectively?), Data
Processing (did the driver correctly interpret the trafﬁc situation according to the available
information?), Objective Target (did the driver make a decision appropriate to the trafﬁc
situation?), and Operation (did the driver carry out his or her decision into operation
properly?).
Using this classiﬁcation, the accident analysis shows that the predominant sources of
human error lie in Information Access and Reception (see Fig. 17.10, [25, 46]).
For machine perception, Klaus Dietmayer, professor in Ulm at the Institute of Mea-
surement, Control, and Microtechnology, Expert for Information fusion, Classiﬁcation,
Multi-Object Tracking, Signal processing and Identiﬁcation (see Chap. 20) names three
essential domains of incertitudes corresponding to human Information Access as well as
Data Processing. These three are: ﬁrstly State-, secondly Existence-, and thirdly Class
uncertainty. All three have a direct impact on machine performance. If the uncertainties in
17
Safety Benefits of Automated Vehicles …
357
these areas increase beyond a yet to be deﬁned “tolerable limit”, errors in the automatic
vehicle guidance can be expected. In terms of making forecasts, currently only an indi-
cation of trends is possible.
While the currently known methods for estimating state and existence uncertainties do not
enable a current estimation of the capability of the machine perception, in principle it is not
possible to predict degeneration in the capability of individual sensors or even a failure of
components. (see Chap. 20)
17.5.3 Potential Safety Benefits of Fully Automatied Vehicles
in Inevitable Incidents
When analyzing the potential safety beneﬁts of fully automated vehicles, it is also
important to consider persistent risks in the area of complex trafﬁc situations and today’s
known inevitable incidents. These include accidents at poorly visible and unclear inter-
sections or behind visual obstructions. In a study of individual cases as part of a doctoral
thesis at the University of Regensburg, visual obstruction was identiﬁed as a contributory
cause in 19 % of all cases [44]. Examples include trees, bushes, hedges, and high grass.
Obstructions for instance may also be the cause of an accident if a child is running out
suddenly and unexpectedly in front of a car from between parked vehicles or a yard
entrance.
This especially includes errors in the sequences of the perception process, in the
accessing and reaches its limits.
Fig. 17.10 Distribution of human error in road traffic (see [25, 46]). Image rights: Author
358
T. Winkle
Due to the large number of possible and non-predictable events, especially the reactive
actions of other road users, the uncertainties increase so strongly after around 2 s–3 s that
reliable trajectory planning is no longer possible on this basis. (see Chap. 20)
Therefore experience-based, internationally valid guidelines with virtual simulation
methods for testing and veriﬁcation of automated vehicles and ﬁnal testing of the overall
system limits in a real environment are recommended. This includes interaction tests with
control algorithms and performance veriﬁcation of real sensors in real trafﬁc situations,
particularly at the time just before a collision [47, 48].
17.6
Conclusion and Outlook
The ﬁndings from road accident research conﬁrm: human failure is the main cause of road
accidents. This especially includes errors in the sequences of the perception process, in the
accessing and reception of information.
In order to estimate the potential safety beneﬁts of highly and fully automated vehicles
from accident data, a sophisticated comparison of the overall performance of humans and
machines is required. This, however, will only be possible when precise knowledge is
available concerning the functional characteristics and technical limits of developments
planned for mass production.
Statistically veriﬁed expert assessments have already proven the potential beneﬁts of
future safety-supporting vehicle- and driver assistance systems. Even before development
has started, for instance, potential beneﬁts can be estimated, and car manufacturers, due to
the analysis and evaluation of road accidents, can also fulﬁll their product monitoring
obligations.
Overall, the results of road-accident analyzes today veriﬁably show that automating
driving tasks from the “driver only”, “assisted”, up to “partially automated” driving
categories are key technologies in contributing to minimizing the consequences of human
failure.
Forecasts for highly and fully automated vehicles, generated using trafﬁc accident data,
only give results based on numerous assumptions. A forecast of fully automated vehicles’
potential safety beneﬁts came from a ﬁrst Daimler accident-research appraisal that is based
on several expert assumptions. According to Daimler’s estimates, practically complete
elimination of accidents is possible by 2070—assuming successful market penetration.
However, only accidents triggered by cars were looked at, and no consideration was given
to physical limits and potential technical defects. This appraisal is thus based on some
assumptions still to be reﬁned and validated in a more detailed fashion in the future.
Above all, current forecasting is still made difﬁcult by technical challenges. Perceiving
and interpreting complex trafﬁc situations, in particular, faces considerable technical
challenges for development engineers. Furthermore, human performance is often under-
estimated. Assistance and partly automated systems essentially are able to compensate for
weaknesses in human capacities according to ﬁndings from road-accident analyzes.

They can increase safety in routine human driving situations with supervision, warnings
and lateral or longitudinal support. To further reduce the numbers of road accidents,
driverless vehicles, on the other hand, at least must ﬁrst match the driving skills of an
attentive human driver, supported by assistance and partly automated systems, considering
a series development. Only when these technical barriers have been overcome, can a
large-scale rollout of marketable fully automated vehicles be expected.
In summary, the following issues limit the validity of the potential safety beneﬁt
forecasts from “driver-only” to fully automated vehicles and will have impact for testing:
– The potential safety beneﬁts stated for levels of automation so far (from driver-only to
advanced functionalities) should be judged and used with care, depending on the data
used. The validity and forecasting reliability of the data material both depend on the
selection and evaluation of available parameters.
– Various approaches to evaluating potential beneﬁts are to be compared with each other
under expert consideration. Areas of action show the ideal maximum of possible
preventable road accidents. In contrast to this is the actual identiﬁable efﬁciency, which
is considerably lower.
– The validity of evaluation methods can vary greatly: it makes a signiﬁcant difference
whether an experienced accident reconstructor or analyst together with experts who
have participated in all development processes of the current systems—in consultation
with medics and psychologists—are involved or not. Such multi-layered background
information allows him or her to get a complete overview of a complex accident
incident and reconstruct or analyze it more precisely than a colleague without this
detailed knowledge.
– There are often many overlapping areas of action within and between analyzes of
potential beneﬁts reducing the overall area of action.
– To obtain further ﬁndings for the development and design of safe automated vehicles
(see Chap. 28), existing in-depth surveys of severe road accidents involving personal
injury (e.g. GIDAS) should be combined with available area-wide accident collision
data, digital geographic mappings, weather data and virtual trafﬁc simulations (see
Chaps. 15 and 16).
– Starting from the level highly automated and beyond, persons involved in an accident
have—temporarily at least—no responsibility for the controllability of the vehicle.
Measures to reduce risks and guarantee the functional safety of electrical and/or
electronic systems are thus of prime importance.
– Fully automated vehicles’ degree of efﬁciency cannot currently be precisely quantiﬁed,
as numerous technical and market-speciﬁc factors are still not known in detail. The
evaluation of automated safety functions has to consider all possible system responses:
True positive (or negative) and false positive (or negative).
– It may be assumed that individual accident scenarios may still arise as a result of
increased degrees of automation, right up to full automation in spite of a
360
T. Winkle
rule-consistent way of driving. This applies, for instance, to physical driving limits or
time-critical situations, such as a child running suddenly in front of a vehicle.
– Area-wide accident analyzes provide relevant scenarios for testing and veriﬁcation of
automated vehicles including virtual simulation methods, but ﬁnal testing of the
overall system limits in a real environment will not be completely eliminated.
The potential safety beneﬁts of fully automated vehicles are ﬁnally also based on the
assumption that over 90 % of today’s road accidents can be put down to human error.
Even if the technology of driverless cars never reaches 100 % perfection, and a few as yet
unknown accident scenarios arise as a result, the vision of area-wide driverless-vehicle use
in road trafﬁc appears to promise a socially desirable beneﬁt. Research activities that make
use of interdisciplinary experts working on vehicle automation should therefore be pro-
moted and strengthened. It is recommended to combine in-depth accident data with all
worldwide geographically deﬁned accident data collections, related weather, trafﬁc, and
vehicle operation data information taking into account data protection measures. This will
lead to actual safety beneﬁts and statistically relevant scenarios for development including
validation or testing of automated driving pertaining to machine versus human perception.

Introduction
The degree of vehicle automation is continuously rising in all modes of transport both on
public trafﬁc infrastructure and in-house transport within company grounds, in order to
improve the productivity, reliability, and ﬂexibility of transport. Due to the growing
information density and the complexity of the geographic division of labor, the idea of
autonomous, decentralized local units is gaining in signiﬁcance. By focusing on private
passenger vehicles, however, public and scientiﬁc debate has until now neglected around
one third of trafﬁc on public roads, i.e. commercial trafﬁc. Thereof, around one third is
goods transportation, because the location of raw material or ﬁnal goods production
seldom coincides with the place of goods demand. Transport itself adds no value to the
product. For this reason, applications where transport could take place without a driver
were developed for in-house logistics as early as in the 1950s. The so-called driving robot
was primarily developed for taking over special missions in dangerous or practically
inaccessible situations. Automated, driverless and partially autonomous vehicles have
therefore been in operation for transporting goods in production and logistics systems for
a long time.
In essence, the question can be asked to what extent fully automated vehicles can also
be meaningfully used in road freight transport on public infrastructure. This is connected
to further questions such as how much sense it makes to bring in such technology, what
are the necessary technological, organizational and legal conditions, but also how logis-
tics, supply chains and freight transport may change as a result.

This chapter ﬁrstly approaches these questions from the historical perspective of
in-house logistics, as this provides a clear understanding of companies’ motivations for
implementing driverless transport systems and the individual experience of company
decision-makers’. Using case studies from the ﬁeld of logistics and freight transport, this
chapter will examine current ﬁelds of application and, wherever possible, the navigation
and safety concept required for autonomous driving as well as control. Moreover, it will
outline speciﬁc use cases for freight transport based on the generic descriptions in Chap. 2.
Other autonomous systems developing in parallel, such as drones, show that completely
new business models are developing in the ﬁeld of logistics. Expected changes in logistic
processes and in human labor in the systems will be discussed using a generic supply
chain approach. The chapter will conclude by making recommendations and suggestions
for further research.
18.2
Development History of Driverless and Autonomous
Transport Systems
Automated guided transport (AGT) systems and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) were
ﬁrstly used for commercial purposes in the early 1950s in the US and approximately ten
years later in Germany [1]. The primary motivation was optimizing the ﬂow of materials
and reducing personnel, as a logical consequence of the ideas for raising productivity
through improving work processes which had been spreading since the early 19th century
(Frederick W. Taylor), from the timing of production processes (shaped in particular by
Gilbreth’s “system of predetermined times”) to continuous assembly line production
(Henry Ford). This development was driven by the mechanization of production due to an
increasing focus on technology by management, to the point of envisioning complete
automation (see the historical development in [1]). Beginning with the automation of
transfers between production processes, the ﬁrst AGT systems were used in production
and warehouses. Compared to automated conveyance systems, such as conveyor belts, the
investments are generally signiﬁcantly lower and the ﬂexibility with regard to changes in
the material ﬂow is considerably higher [2]. Transport is regarded as an unproductive
activity, but must nevertheless demonstrate high reliability in production and warehouse
systems.
18.2.1 Driverless Indoor Transport Systems
Typical indoor applications of AGT systems connect production and assembly processes,
incoming and outgoing goods areas as well as picking areas and warehouses. AGT
systems and work robots, such as those for picking, palletizing, etc., are frequently
combined in a single apparatus. In in-house logistics, the encounter between humans and
AGT/AGV systems was therefore always envisioned since AGT/AGV systems generally
366
H. Flämig
perform other functions as well, for example supporting the picking process. Early per-
sonal safety concepts worked with tactile, mechanical bars or bumpers [2]. Today, laser
scanners are more widely used which, depending on the driving speed, can cover up to
7 m [2] and are frequently combined with other sensor technologies. The stabilization
level plays a relatively minor role in in-house transport as the company itself maintains the
ﬂoor surface in a drivable state.
In early systems, the guidance level in the indoor component of in-house transports was
generally implemented with electrical conductors embedded in the ﬂoors. Today the
following different types for position recognition and positioning can be distinguished [3]:
On the one hand, this includes the physical guide, implemented either as an active
inductive guide path, as a magnetic tape or optical guide path. On the other hand, tech-
nologies for free navigation which utilize ﬂoor markings (metal, magnets, transponders) or
laser technology in which position-determination functions something like in maritime
transport (cross bearing) can be found. Newer technologies combine laser scanners and
camera systems with digital-environment maps and enable navigation by characteristics of
the environment.
Data transmission between the stationary and mobile units of an AGT system was
previously conducted using inductive or infrared data transmission. Today, narrowband
and increasingly broadband transmission (WLAN) are predominant. Radio direction
ﬁnding enables localization via indoor GPS (Global Positioning System) with an accuracy
up to 0.5 m, with outdoor GPS precise to within 10 m, dGPS (Differential GPS) accurate
up to 1 m and dGPS with phase evaluation precise to within 0.1 m.
Vehicles are assigned to driving tasks and are coordinated [2]. The control concept
consists of a control unit through which execution of the transport order, transport order
processing, vehicle allocation and transport execution are managed centrally. The trafﬁc
control system is part of the vehicle job execution. Clearance for individual sections of the
route is done similarly to the rail trafﬁc system in block sections that can only be occupied
by one vehicle at a time.
One such system was implemented in the distribution center of a logistics service
provider in 2011 [3]. In the picking process, AGT systems are used in which the pickers
are carried by the vehicle as well. The safety of the picker is ensured through various
measures, as with the safety regulations for rail transport in which passengers are required
to assume a particular position with their hands and feet. It is therefore not possible to
carry out other activities while the vehicle is in motion. The operator safety concept relies
on laser scanners. Navigation relies on a magnetic point sequence guide system, and the
control system utilizes wireless-technology for data transmission.
The AGT/AGV control system is also handled centrally in the new systems. Expanding
the systems is therefore always associated with major expenses, so research into auton-
omous, decentralized control solutions is afoot here as well.
One current example is the autonomous reach forklift truck developed in the “marion
(mobile, autonomous, cooperative robots in complex value creation chains)” project,
which
in
turn
was
developed
as
part
of
the
“Autonomik”
(autonomous
and
18
Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport
367
simulation-based systems for SMEs) technology program. The tasks of vehicles are
assigned by a superordinate system. The forklift executes the task autonomously and
calculates and determines the optimal route independently. It is equipped with a 3D-laser,
laser scanner and cameras for 3D environment detection. Through sensors, the forklift can
precisely assess the environment, the object dimensions and its spatial position.
One example of a decentralized control system has been developed in the project
“decentralized, agent-based self-control of automated guided transport systems” [4]. In
this system, various agents are modeled for each vehicle. Route planning and task
assignment take place cooperatively. Simulations showed a reduction in the overall route
distances of all AGVs, a roughly 8 % drop in the empty trip share, a 22 % decrease of lead
times and a minor increase of the utilization rate of the AGVs [5]. At the
Fraunhofer-Institute for Material Flow and Logistics (IML), a cellular transport system
based on swarm intelligence was developed in the “Swarm Intelligence for Logistics”
project. In this system, the swarm (the means of transport) receives the transport jobs, the
nearest vehicle takes on the job and dynamically determines the shortest path.
18.2.2 Outdoor Automated Guided Vehicles on Private Property
Outdoor applications for autonomous vehicles on private property are AGT systems for
heavy transports or in-plant shuttle trafﬁc are common, as the following examples
demonstrate.
At a container terminal, automated guided vehicles move containers between the
container cranes and the stacking area [6]. The objective is to shorten routes, reduce empty
trips and achieve optimal utilization of all resources. Transponders installed in the ground
are used for positioning. Route planning is done independently, as are battery changes.
Coordinating control is conducted via radio data transmission.
In Germany, a major cooperation behind driverless trucks is a company that was
originally active in the radio technology sector. In 2012, for example, this company
implemented a driverless truck-shuttle between the production and logistics buildings on
the factory grounds of a dairy company [7]. Loading and unloading of the pallets laden
with fresh products and packaging materials are done automatically. The lane-guidance
system utilizes transponders in the pathway. A sensor is installed beneath the towing
vehicle that uses the markings on the ﬂoor for orientation and route determination. Aided
by steering rear axles, the vehicles can drive small envelopes and achieve positioning
precision to within 2 cm. Laser scanners scan the environment and together with contact
switch strips and emergency stop buttons ensure the safety of people, goods and the
vehicle itself.
The “Sichere autonome Logistik- und Transportfahrzeuge (SaLsA)” [“Safe autono-
mous logistics and transport vehicles”] project led to further developments that made the
encounter between AGT systems, trucks and people in the outdoor environment safer [8].
In the outdoor environment, the safety concept consists of radar sensors, since laser
368
H. Flämig
scanners are not permitted there. The cooperative scanning of the environment through
mobile and stationary sensors enables safe operation even at higher speeds (economic
viability).
18.2.3 Autonomous Vehicles for Road Freight Transport Outside
of Plant Grounds
The development of autonomous vehicles for freight transport and logistics outside of
plant grounds is primarily conducted on a problem-oriented basis. So called driving robots
were developed for use in dangerous situations, e.g. for disarming munitions, or for use in
difﬁcult-to-access areas such as deep-sea exploration, work on mountain sides or in dense
forests and remote areas such as for work in the mining sector.
Very large automated trucks with a maximum load capacity of 290 metric tons have
been used at one of the world’s largest iron-ore mines in Australia since the 1990s [9]. The
reason for their development was primarily difﬁculties in stafﬁng, the dangerous shift
work in the outback and the demanding logistical requirements in terms of personnel
planning and staff transfer.
Navigation is done via radar and lasers as well as through the use of waypoints for
orientation. Monitoring and intervention options are possible via an operation center using
wireless transmission. Control is carried out via GPS and dead reckoning, such as in ships
or aircraft, through continuous position determination by means of measuring the course,
speed and time.
18.2.4 Development of Autonomous Driving and Autonomous
Vehicles in Other Means of Transport
Other means of transport, in which technical systems for stabilization, navigation (e.g.
digital maps) and environment cognition are used have also seen increasing degrees of
automation.
Aircrafts have been equipped with stabilization systems since the early 20th century,
autopilot functions are a long-established feature and the ﬁrst drones in Germany are
already in use in military, police and ﬁreﬁghting applications. Unmanned aerial systems or
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also used in civil applications in other countries,
replacing for example ranchers and inspectors in remote areas. Drones monitor and seed
ﬁelds and perform pest control functions. Small drones are already in use in Germany as
well, for example for inspecting damage caused by storms or ﬁres, in ﬁlm productions and
industrial inspections. Deutsche Bahn (the by far largest German railway company) is
currently testing drones for monitoring vehicles and infrastructure. There are also pilot
studies under way in the area of transporting commercial goods, in particular packages.
With a carrying capacity of up to 2.5 kg and a range of approximately 15 km, current
18
Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport
369
drones could for example be used to deliver food or medications. A drone that can be used
to transport a deﬁbrillator has also been tested. The use of drones for commercial purposes
over 5 kg has been generally permitted in many federal states, albeit not in controlled
airspace [10].
Initial studies about unmanned maritime transport are currently under way (see e.g. the
European research project MUNIN). Unmanned submarines have been used for some
time. Concepts for drone ships are developed by various actors. One concept resembles
platooning (see Sect. 18.3.4) in road trafﬁc [11]. Here, in contrast to air trafﬁc, it is
possible to have crews boarding vessels at any time for example in heavily traveled areas
such as the approaches to ports. As a rule, these systems will not act entirely autono-
mously, even not in the future. Although evasive maneuvers can be carried out inde-
pendently, it can be presumed that centralized monitoring and remote controlling will
remain standard practice, though the two instances need not be one and the same.
Remote control of driverless railway systems has been in place for years. Autonomous
driving would include free navigation and would only be useful for very small units. To
date, attempts to introduce smaller freight transport units on railways such as the Car-
goSprinter have been unsuccessful. In part, this is due to the fact that there is no fast
technology for train composition, thus separate power transmission is required for each
carriage. This deﬁciency was addressed with the RailCab concept [12]. Here, autonomous,
linear motor-driven vehicles use the wheel and track system. The train composition is
carried out through an electronic drawbar. This is expensive and there are few suitable
applications in which a truck could not perform the transport. On the main carriage routes,
efﬁciency gains through economies of scale speak against non-prescheduled routing and
variable convoy formation. But there could be economically viable applications on
non-electriﬁed branch lines. To date, however, there are no known studies comparing the
environmental and economic implications under market conditions.
18.2.5 Interim Conclusion
AGT systems consist of a guidance control system, in particular for order assignment and
route planning, a communication system and the vehicles [4]. Automated guided transport
systems and vehicles (AGTS/AGV) for in-house transport with low levels of automation
have been in existence for a long time. The degree of automation has risen with
advancements in technology, albeit in different ways than in public road transportation.
For example, the applicable Machinery Directive for the design of such systems clearly
deﬁnes the safety concepts. In the past it was sufﬁcient for the AGTS/AGV in in-house
logistics to be able to move in a forward direction, generally in sceneries in which people
were accustomed to driverless vehicles. In some cases people and vehicles are physically
separated. In sum, the safety concepts are restricted to a minimum as the AGT/AGV
systems operate at low speeds and in known, clearly deﬁned circumstances.
370
H. Flämig
Technological advancements focused on the correct execution of transport tasks and
associated other tasks such as loading and unloading the cargo. Nevertheless, it may be
presumed that the requirements with regard to the ﬂexibility of AGT/AGV systems will
rise as production moves away from linear assembly lines and the production and picking
systems themselves become more ﬂexible. At present, autonomous systems based on the
agent technology seem best suited for the processing of increased data volumes and rising
complexity, due to the decentralization of data provision and decision-making processes.
Outdoor solutions for freight transport are based on conventional road vehicles and to
date have only been in regular use on private company grounds. There are only few use
cases to speak of to date. But similar developments to the indoor area are generally
conceivable.
The question with AGT/AGV systems then is how the autonomy of the units will
develop in the future. Automatic control and driverless movement have by deﬁnition
always been elements of AGT/AGV systems. The degree of autonomy is deﬁned as the
number of degrees of freedom. This depends, for example, on the free selection of the
route and speed to move independently to a destination even in changing environmental
situations.
The use of mobile machines represents a point of contact between work robots and
vehicles. Just as with in-house transport systems, the transport task is frequently combined
with other “productive” tasks. These are mostly remotely operated systems. Thus,
autonomous decision-making in terms of route determination is generally not the case.
This also seems unlikely to generate added value in the majority of possible applications.
In the early stages, the conceptual outline for automation solutions depended very
strongly on the use context. These historical system elements are generally also found in
the newer conceptual approaches, in particular with regard to the vehicle and operator
safety concepts. It was only with the advent of decentralized concepts utilizing the new
information and communication technologies that these different system solutions have
been able to converge. In particular in situations in which high ﬂexibility and speed are
demanded, the technological solutions are becoming increasingly similar. They do differ
in terms of the degree of autonomy, though.
18.3
Use Cases in the Field of Autonomous Freight Transport
Building on the experiences described here, the following will sketch potential applica-
tions for autonomous vehicles in the ﬁeld of freight transport using the generic use cases
described in Chap. 2. The focus is on the transport of a speciﬁc good in road freight trafﬁc.
Potential applications in further segments of commercial transportation such as passenger
transportation and goods transport in the context of production (self-driving work
machines) are not examined here.
Based on a conceptual description of the respective use case and in light of the speciﬁc
features, an initial estimation of the beneﬁts, opportunities and risks of introducing such a
18
Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport
371
technology will be discussed. The examination will begin, however, with a consideration
of the degrees of automation in driving for freight transport, in order to better distinguish
the implications of the various use cases.
18.3.1 Excursus: Degrees of Automation in Autonomous Freight
Transport
To assess the necessity and beneﬁts of a certain degree of automation in freight transport,
ﬁrst we will return to the deﬁnition of the driving task according to [13], whereby it is
described as follows: The safe execution of the driving task requires information and
knowledge regarding the trafﬁc situation on the guidance level, the driving surface on the
stabilization level, as well as the road network on the navigation level. Safe conduct of the
vehicle requires steering, acceleration and braking as well as decisions regarding speed
and course for longitudinal and lateral control of the vehicle. The decisions required for
this are made on the basis of information regarding environmental conditions and the
associated knowledge of the action to be taken.
The German Federal Highway Research Institute categorizes automated driving into
four development levels [14]: assisted driving (1), partially automated driving (2), highly
automated driving (3) and fully automated driving (4). In the ﬁrst three levels, the system
performs partial aspects of the driving task for a speciﬁc time and/or in speciﬁc situations.
But the driver is available at least as a supervisory organ. For the last level of fully
automated driving (4), [14] presumes that the vehicle is navigating freely and no driver is
required as a fallback level.
In the area of freight transport, automated guided transport systems exist even on low
automation levels. With an intermediate level between (3) and (4), another relevant variant
in transport practice can be observed: The vehicle is highly automated and driverless, but
free navigation does not occur. In many cases, the vehicle is controlled remotely by an
operator via a control center.
18.3.2 Use Cases for Autonomous Freight Transport
Assisted and partially automated systems are already common in series-production
vehicles. They take over longitudinal and/or lateral control of the vehicle for a certain
period of time and/or in speciﬁc situations. In the assisted systems, the driver is warned; in
partially automated systems, the system assumes control. The impetus—for example
braking—must still be provided by the driver. The most well-known driver assistance
systems (DAS) are anti-lock brake systems (ABS) and electronic stability programs
(ESP). Due to severe road accident, lane-change assistants, lane-departure warning sys-
tems and adaptive cruise control functions became mandatory for new vehicles ahead of
schedule in 2013. Other systems are in development or are already ready for production,
372
H. Flämig
such as anti-rollover systems, cornering systems or parking systems. They are primarily
focused on assisting the driver on the guidance and stabilization levels.
Highly and fully automated vehicles can also navigate freely; they are situation- and
infrastructure-independent. Fully automated systems can function without a driver. Not
only activities on the navigation level are assumed by the driving robot, but also the
activities that are necessary to return the system to a minimal-risk state when components
fail.
From the perspective of freight trafﬁc and logistics, technological solutions for the
stabilization and guidance levels are therefore not the primary focus. Of greater interest
are the potential use cases with and without drivers and free navigation. A closer
examination is conducted on the following distinctions in the use cases:
1. Interstate Pilot as highly automated highway driving with a driver and free
navigation;
2. Vehicle On Demand as highly automated highway driving without a driver and with
free navigation;
3. Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability—Follow-me Vehicle as
highly automated driving without a driver and without free navigation (missing use
case 3/4),
4. Valet Parking as highly automated driving without a driver and without free navi-
gation (missing use case 3/4).
In the following, the use cases will be introduced and initial arguments for and against
the respective degree of autonomy in logistics and freight transport are presented. In each
case it will be assessed to what extent the use cases in the freight trafﬁc system coincide
with the “Use Cases of Autonomous Driving” (see Chap. 2) for private transportation,
what
differences
exist
and
what
the
implications
of
such
differences
are
for
implementation.
18.3.3 Interstate Pilot with Driver and Free Navigation
Interstate pilot describes the use case in which an autopilot function is used, but a driver is
available at all times. The driver hands over the stabilization and guidance level (and thus
also navigation) to the autopilot, ideally after specifying a destination address. The use of
an interstate pilot is intended between entering and exiting the interstate. The driver
assumes control when confronted with unclear driving situations (e.g. construction zones).
The posited beneﬁts of the interstate pilot are provided by the reduction of accidents
and an improved trafﬁc ﬂow. Particularly in trafﬁc jams or stop-and-go trafﬁc situations,
but also on long, monotonous journeys, as well as due to the ever-increasing time-pressure
of modern life, drivers are often close to their performance limits. In addition to unburden
the driver from stressful driving situations, the interstate pilot also creates free time that
18
Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport
373
can be used for other purposes. Here there are deliberations as to whether activities such as
route planning and ﬂeet management might not also be decentralized.
A ﬁrst case of application has been already reported from as early as 1987, when the
University of the Armed Forces in Munich, Germany, was experimenting with a lorry
driving on a motorway [15]. In 2013, the vehicle-manufacturer Scania presented a truck
that could “independently accelerate, brake and steer” up to a speed of 50 km/h [16]. In
2014, Daimler had a truck driving up to 85 km/h amid other vehicles on a closed section
of interstate [17].
The envisioned interstate pilot is essentially enabling fully automated driving. Due to
safety considerations, however, the concept still depends on an available driver, which in
effect reduces the scenario to being only highly automated. The effective top speed and the
higher maximum permissible mass together require different safety concepts than in
private transportation.
Changes are expected primarily in terms of the job description of the driver. To date,
drivers have been obliged to learn much about vehicle technology and securing loads.
Would the driver continue to perform the technical inspection of the vehicle? What
economic and environmental beneﬁts would be associated with the concept?
18.3.4 Vehicle on Demand Without a Driver and with Free
Navigation
Vehicle on demand most closely resembles the use case, which, in the ﬁeld of freight
transport, is known as an autonomous, decentralized AGT/AGV system. A driver’s seat is
not envisioned. However, in the use case outlined in Chap. 2 the vehicle can operate at
speeds of up to 120 km/h and in unknown scenarios.
There is some reason to believe that the “vehicle on demand” use case comes very
close to the conception of autonomous vehicles in freight transport desired by companies
in the industry: The local-language-speaking driver who is willing to undertake long
interstate journeys with long periods of absence and irregular working hours for low pay is
ever-more-difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Overtired truck drivers are the most common cause of severe
accidents. Docking and maneuvering in tight delivery situations is always a tricky task for
the driver.
The use of automation technology could therefore be of great beneﬁt. However, the
approval of all scenarios for heavy trucks will take time, in particular due to safety
concerns and required changes in the supply chain (see Sect. 18.4).
More likely is the realization of the interstate pilot without a driver and with free
navigation between rendezvous points in the medium term, for example between rest areas
on highways or between well-connected commercial zones. The likelihood of imple-
mentation of this use case could be increased through the following enhancement
concepts:
374
H. Flämig
Safety concerns due to the lack of a driver on the fallback level could be mitigated by
having separate highway entrances and exits for autonomous vehicles, as this would
reduce encounters with other vehicles to a minimum. A dedicated lane for autonomous,
coupled vehicles could probably avoid these concerns entirely. At the same time, such a
dedicated lane could be the starting point for an extended concept with alternative drive
technology, if the lane were, for example, outﬁtted with an overhead contact line for
supplying electricity.
The coupling of vehicles (platooning) would combine the initial concept of having a
driver available in the lead vehicle as a backup with the extended concept in which
vehicles drive autonomously without drivers and utilize the beneﬁts of each concept. The
platooning vehicles would be connected via a software system. Implementing the
so-called electronic drawbar at high speeds would enable not only improved utilization of
the road infrastructure, but above all reduced fuel consumption and emissions due to
reduced wind resistance.
Numerous tests have been carried out with the electronic drawbar since the mid-1990s
[e.g. the European projects “CHAUFFEUR I and II”, “Safe Road Trains for the Envi-
ronment (SARTRE)”, “Cooperative mobility solution for supervised platooning (COM-
PANION)”,
the
Californian
“PATH
Program”,
the
German
“KONVOI-Projekt:
Entwicklung und Untersuchung des Einsatzes von elektrisch gekoppelten Lkw-Konvois
auf Autobahnen”, and the Japanese “ITS Project” by the New Energy and Industrial
Technology Development Organization (NEDO)]. In these projects, multiple trucks or a
convoy of lead trucks and following passenger cars safely drove at up to 90 km/h with a
minimum gap of 4 m. The systems were based on surveillance by radar sensors, stereo
cameras, three-dimensional maps and usually also data exchange with other vehicles.
Previous trials were always conducted with a driver in the lead vehicle and with or without
drivers for extended availability in the following vehicles. There are already ideas under
consideration for a driverless lead vehicle.
As a rule these projects build on proven existing technology: adaptive cruise control
systems integrated in series-production vehicles serve to maintain the gaps between the
vehicles. Data transmission between the lead and following vehicle is frequently
conducted via wireless-transmission or infrared technology.
The measured fuel savings and CO2-reduction potential differed depending on the
selected vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication (in “off-center” mode), the type and
construction of the lead vehicle and following vehicles, the gap, the speed as well as the
road and environmental conditions (surface, temperature, inclines, altitude). The differ-
ence was roughly 5 % for the lead truck and 10–15 % for the following passenger vehicles
[18].

375
18.3.5 Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability—
Follow-Me Vehicle
In the use case presented in Chap. 2, the vehicle takes fully automated control whenever
the situation is approved for that mode. The driver is at any time available and can resume
vehicle control if necessary. In practice it is an extension of the interstate pilot in terms of
approved situations and the permissible speed and is very similar to autonomous driving.
This use case is only interesting from an economic perspective if the accompanying
driver can pursue value-creating activities during the drive. The next delivery could be
prepared or processed from an administrative standpoint during the drive itself. Such
vehicle concepts would also be conceivable for use in commercial passenger trafﬁc, for
example for activities in elderly care, the insurance industry, etc., which involve docu-
mentation and administrative work.
The “EmiL” concept study of a partially autonomous delivery vehicle in 2011 can be
regarded as a sort of preliminary stage of development before full automation [19]. In this
concept, the delivery person does not need to continually get in and out of the vehicle, but
can instruct the vehicle via mobile phone to drive next to him at walking speed (follow-me
function). For all unknown situations (e.g. merging situations, intersections), there is the
additional DriveStick mode in which the vehicle can be driven at up to a speed of 6 km/h.
The use of a local wireless-connection precludes signal interruptions that are feared and
can indeed occur with GPS connections.
The research project determined a time-saving of about 40 min over a one-day delivery
period. The typical injury risk of twisting or rolling an ankle when getting out of the
vehicle is also reduced.
18.3.6 Valet Parking—Valet Delivery
Valet parking refers to the use case in which the autopilot independently navigates the
vehicle to a previously assigned parking spot. The concept presented in Chap. 2 assumes
that this could be possible in the public sphere at speeds of up to 30 km/h. One example
could be autonomous driving from a driver’s place of residence to a deﬁned parking spot.
This use case is scarcely conceivable in the context of freight transport, however, as there
are truck-parking locations rarely connected via the secondary road network.
Much more likely is a scenario in which the autopilot would take over in tight
inner-city areas and industrial and retail delivery zones not designed for large trucks and
park or dock the truck independently. This could prevent expensive car damages to occur.
The driver would be relieved of stressful driving tasks, which would be particularly
advantageous in light of the driver’s remaining responsibility for long, exhausting high-
way drives. Valet delivery could also help drivers comply with legal rest times if the “last
mile” could be conducted without their assistance.

Another potential use case could be delivery to construction sites. In major construc-
tion jobs, trucks are increasingly held in so-called waiting zones in the vicinity of the
construction site. These processes could be optimized if drivers in large-scale
concrete-pouring actions could concentrate on their runs and the wait times were elimi-
nated. The autopilot would take over driving between the waiting point and the con-
struction site.
From a legal standpoint, implementation would depend heavily on the distance
between the waiting point and site as well as the concrete scenario. Otherwise imple-
mentation would seem to be more of a mental than a technical challenge. In particular
from the driver’s perspective, who would be confronted with scenarios in which it is
essentially alleged that he or she does not handle their working tool with the required
skills.
18.4
Changes in the Supply Chain Resulting from a Higher
Degree of Automation in Freight Transport
A systematic examination of the changes in the supply chain resulting from a higher
degree of automation in freight transport can be seen in the generic supply chain depicted
in Fig. 18.1. Every supply chain consists of a succession of the activities “raw material
extraction”, “processing/production”, “trade”, and the intermediate logistical processes
“goods issue (handling)”, “transport”, and “goods receipt (handling)”. Moreover, under
the current conditions of production and retail logistics, it is equally interesting to consider
the effects of a lacking driver since a lot of added-value-services are performed by the
logistics providers in those scenarios.
Aside from driving itself, “transport” requires inspection of the vehicle, route planning
as well as documentation and other administrative tasks (shipping documents) taken over
by the driver. These activities are even more comprehensive in the case of cross-border
trafﬁc (customs). With highly automated, driverless or fully automated driving, the
common problem of driving and rest-period violations would become obsolete and routes
could be planned differently. If transports were conducted in a highly-automated manner,
the driver would be expected to perform other tasks in this period, for example performing
route planning, ﬂeet management or simply resting [21].
In other words, it could lead to both a decentralization and parallelization of functions.
The use of the transport time for other activities is not new, however. For example, postal
shipments were previously handled in trains (postal trains), and the same phenomenon can
be observed today, in mobile depots (e.g. repurposed double-decker buses, “ﬂoating
warehouse systems”).
The driver must always supervise the driving task and sometimes takes over person-
ally. At the goods issue point, he or she is responsible for checking the shipping papers
and securing the load. At the goods receipt point, he or she is responsible for demanding a
receipt conﬁrmation.

Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport
377
Today, in goods issue and receipt, in many supply chains the driver is responsible for
loading and unloading the vehicle. The driver’s responsibility frequently ends at the
loading ramp, but in some cases only after placement of the goods in the receiving facility,
or even after pre-sorting, internal transport and shelving of the material (in some cases in
temporary storage locations). As in earlier times, for some parcel and letter delivery
operations it is common for the driver to pick the orders himself.
In the ﬁeld of production, conceivable applications would include own-account
transport in which—similarly to the in-house segment—transport jobs are tendered and
autonomous trucks could “apply” for and win the transport jobs based on predeﬁned
criteria. In this case neither a central control function nor route determination is required.
Some gates already have freight locks, making workforce obsolete in place at the transfer
of risk.
If the driver no longer “accompanies” the vehicle, his or her activities would have to be
performed by others. Companies then would have once again to hire or train own staff for
such activities. The logistics companies might also opt for a different business model to
account for these changes. This could lead to a general revaluation of work and the
creation of local jobs, particularly in urban areas. In other cases, however, a further
increase in the degree of automation in goods receipt and issue departments could be
envisioned.

Changes in the transport systems themselves can be expected primarily at the contact
points between unmanned and manned driving as well as in the task proﬁle of drivers. The
changes to processes in rail and maritime trafﬁc as well as in the spectrum of activities
performed by humans do not seem overly serious. The driver is removed from the sce-
nario and replaced by an autopilot. The remaining technology in trains and ships has
heretofore been excluded from any proposed changes. Also, new job descriptions could
emerge, for example if the aspect of security against pirates in sea transport were to be
given greater weight than the navigation aspect.
18.5
Initial Microeconomic Assessments of Automated Systems
in the Freight Transport Chain
From a microeconomic perspective, a lack of driving personnel, an energy-saving driving
style, high reliability and accident evasion are signiﬁcant reasons to employ autonomous
systems in the freight transport chain. In some industries, the material ﬂow from goods
receipt to the production lines and eventual goods issue are already highly automated and
driverless, which eliminates interruptions and idle times. Loading and unloading from
warehouses is also highly automated and driverless in some sectors. In some cases, the
control of warehousing and production is coordinated and ranges from automated goods
receipt to automated goods issue.
The development of radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) technology and the redis-
covery of Leonardo da Vinci’s idea of learning from nature (bionics) inspired a debate on
independent control and led to an intensive debate on the decentralization and
decision-making autonomy of technical systems. Aided by technological developments in
cost-effective sensors and internet-aided software systems, the degree of automation has
risen continuously. The latest systems in production and warehouses have come to rely on
independent control (“internet of things”) of the vehicles and conveyor systems, which
can react autonomously to changing requirements, states and environmental conditions.
Based on the extremely advanced degree of automation of in-house AGT/AGV
systems in some industries, further shifts of the human role towards conceptual and
supervisory activities can be expected. The use of driverless vehicles in the entire
logistical system can be expected to lead to a reorganization of processes in many supply
chains (see Sect. 18.4). However, automation will continue to grow only in particular
industries as the relation between costs and beneﬁts is not equally favorable in all sectors.
Within the transport system in the public space, the lack of a driver and/or the driver’s
changing role will lead to additional interfaces that need to be designed according to
certain requirements. The driver getting in and out of the vehicle requires additional stops.
In the in-house ﬁeld, there is already substantial experience to draw upon, for example,
with regard to picking. In the trafﬁc systems, such experience is limited. In maritime
shipping, for example, it is quite common that a port skipper is taking over active control
18
Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport

of the ship when entering the port area. In the road freight trafﬁc system, the predominant
transshipment systems generally involve changing the trailer rather than the driver. These
systems have many advantages such as quick transfer times for materials and goods, and
results in increasing productive times of the vehicles. They also improve the working
conditions for the drivers, who can return to their local branches daily. In practice,
however, this only works in large networks or in partnership-type relationships with
trustworthy and reliable partners. This applies not only to punctuality, but also with
respect to the securing of the load. To date, the most widespread use of these systems has
been with the large integrators and courier, express and parcel (CEP) service providers
specialized on the transshipment of standardized packages.
For the implementation of driverless transport chains in road freight transport, then
there are also questions of cost and liability in transport law that need to be clariﬁed, going
beyond questions of technical compatibility of the autonomous vehicles with the infras-
tructure and with other vehicles or platooning trucks.
If damages to the goods or vehicle occur due to system failure, product liability comes
into play (for details, see Chap. 25). It follows that autopilots, consisting of hardware
components (sensors, processors and actuators) and software components must be
constructed in such ways that potential damages can be traced to the individual compo-
nents and thus their producers.
18.6
Initial Macroeconomic Assessments of Automated
Systems in the Freight Transport Chain
Judging from a macroeconomic perspective as well, automated systems could provide an
approach to resolve structural deﬁcits in the current transport system. In times of tight
public budgets, a signiﬁcant expansion of the trafﬁc infrastructure, and in particular rail
and inland waterways, is not likely to occur in the near future.
Automated driving, with its minimal space requirements and rather equal speed levels,
could at least double the existing average road infrastructure capacity. Moreover, it could
contribute to achieving environmental policy goals, as automated driving reduces fuel
consumption. Already today, driver assistance systems make a signiﬁcant contribution to
reducing trafﬁc accidents. Such accidents could also be avoided by the use of highly and
fully automated vehicles, as they can recognize the ends of trafﬁc jams, avoid risky
overtaking maneuvers and entirely eliminate wrong-way driving. However, the questions
concerning legal liability in the event of an accident have not yet been exhaustively
resolved.
In the case of platooning, a professional driver could be used in the lead vehicle, as is
envisioned in most of the projects. This approach has the advantage of enabling even
unpracticed long-haul drivers (beginners, the elderly) to join a convoy. This would also
require that freight and passenger vehicles have the ability to communicate with each
other.
380
H. Flämig
However, it is not only technological determinism that offers strong arguments against
automated road vehicles: Efﬁciency increases in road trafﬁc also give rise to conﬂicts with
mass transport systems. Automated platooning stands in direct competition with the
railways, as did long trucks before them. Although at present there is a lack of profes-
sional truck drivers in Germany, the overall number of professional truck drivers would
decrease, and in other countries with high unemployment, much-needed jobs would be
lost.
Moreover, public acceptance of fully automated systems is limited—not least due to
continuous reports of failures of mechanical or electronic components in vehicles, or the
fear of unstable data connections. Autonomous vehicles therefore would also have to be
equipped with reliable software (artiﬁcial intelligence) that can respond to all eventualities
—in particular when humans and animals are present on the roads.
Also judging from a legal perspective, autopilots outside of factory grounds are a
novelty. Previous AGT/AGV systems were handled according to the Machinery Direc-
tive, with stringent vehicle and operator safety concepts. An expansion of the sphere of
action (private/public) and the operating speeds (walking speed to highway speeds) of the
systems could necessitate new laws or adjustments to the existing legal framework.
The use of autonomous vehicles in road trafﬁc would require abolishment of the legal
restrictions set forth in the Vienna Convention on Road Trafﬁc which stipulates that a
driver must maintain control over the vehicle at all times. There have been recent
developments in this regard in the United States, where the law has been adapted to permit
deviation from the control requirement insofar as the system “can be overridden or
switched off by the driver.” If this legal stance were to be accepted in Europe as well, it
would mean that there has to be a superordinate actor that can always intervene in
controlling the vehicle. In the areas of rail, maritime and air trafﬁc, the systems are already
designed in this manner, and for rail and air trafﬁc there are accepted superordinate actors.
For road freight trafﬁc, such an actor must still be created. Public acceptance is also yet to
be ensured.
18.7
Conclusion and Outlook
Since the 1960s, (driverless) automated guided transport (AGT) systems have been in use
in in-house logistics in Germany. However, these systems have not received sufﬁcient
attention either in the media or in transport research. In in-house logistics, for example,
transponders are used as waypoints that can also store information. If vehicles in the
public space would always have to recognize all environmental features and special
characteristics of every route, appropriate cost-intensive hardware and software systems
would be required. This could be avoided if waypoints would provide certain information
that could be read-out temporarily. In this context, extrapolated to the transport system,
the question arises as to how the road infrastructure would have to be changed.

Autonomous Vehicles and Autonomous Driving in Freight Transport
381
Fully automated driving creates the opportunity to steer vehicles between the departure
point and the destination without human intervention. The autopilot performs not only the
stabilization and guidance tasks, but also navigation, and thus is also responsible for
ensuring accident-free driving.
The assessment of the current situation with respect to the development of autonomous
road trafﬁc systems made clear that passenger and freight trafﬁc must be viewed in a much
more integrated fashion. It would also be interesting to have a closer look at autonomous
system development with regard to other means of transport. Autopilots in aircrafts have
long been the norm. As early as the beginning of the twentieth century, stabilization
systems were used in aviation. Drones are already being used. The ﬁrst studies on the
European level of unmanned maritime transport are under way. Remote control of trains
has been in use for years as well. What is new is the quality of autonomous
decision-making in the case of changing environmental situations and changing driving
and transport orders. The expanding ﬁelds of application, for instance through drones in
the aviation sector, highlight the importance of completely rethinking the distribution of
transport jobs across the different means of transportation. More research is needed here.
Many exciting insights and new developments could be expected if the broad ﬁeld of
commercial passenger trafﬁc would be studied in greater detail. Much alike in freight
transport, it is concerned with mobility in exercising a profession. Since moving from one
location to another is only a means to perform a service at the destination, in most cases
mobility itself is regarded much more pragmatically, compared to individual mobility.
The combination of partial scenarios of individual, autonomous logistics processes to
form a comprehensive autonomous supply chain from automated raw material extraction
and all phases of production and logistics to product delivery to the end customer requires
an integrated approach. Technologically speaking, tremendous progress has been realized
in recent years. Research should therefore focus primarily on the (required) degree of
automation for individual logistics processes as well as on elucidating the micro-and
macroeconomic beneﬁts and costs of those developments.
Due to the open legal questions and the lack of acceptance of both the general public
and to some extent of corporate decision-makers for the use of autonomous systems in
road freight transport (as well as to some extent in other transport systems), gradual,
step-by-step introduction seems to be the only realistic approach. It will therefore depend
on ﬁnding the right cascade approach and implementation strategy. To date, speciﬁc
deliberations on the respective implementation aspects of the outlined use cases are
missing.
On ﬁrst glance, it appears reasonable to combine some of the solution approaches
currently being discussed with regard to increasing the capacity of the infrastructure,
economical use of resources and environmental protection. Starting to introduce auton-
omous driving in closed transport systems (e.g. transport in system cooperation) and
manageable scenarios (e.g. interstate, airport grounds, ports) will help to overcome
reluctance concerning the technologies as well as lacking standardization. The
382
H. Flämig
step-by-step implementation of platooning, starting with manned lead and following
vehicles, could build the requisite acceptance among the general public. It must be
examined whether the simultaneous introduction of overhead electricity-powered trucks
and thus the creation of a dedicated lane would be sensible in view of capacity and safety
requirements.
However, even platooning raises several follow-up questions, in particular regarding
decision-making and the distribution of beneﬁts: If the fuel savings depend on a vehicle’s
position in the convoy, who decides which position each vehicle has in the chain? If the
convoy drove without drivers in the following vehicles, who would pay for the driver in
the lead vehicle? Would the lead driver require more/special training than the other
drivers? Prior to introduction, it would also be necessary to clarify how other platooning
vehicles can be identiﬁed. A common standard would have to be developed to ensure that
the other vehicles are also trustworthy. Here the need for further study and the recom-
mendations for action are closely interrelated.
Changes in the supply chain and freight transport show a highly ambivalent picture that
must be examined in greater detail. For the relating understanding, assessment and
categorization, it must be clariﬁed which technological changes and challenges will arise
for the driving task itself. It is also essential to identify in greater detail the advantages and
disadvantages of using automated vehicles compared to conventional vehicles as well as
their integratability in the existing work environment, by analyzing different job proﬁles in
the commercial environment. To date, the question of what can be transported autono-
mously and what degree of autonomy would be accepted from industry with regard to
necessity, cost and ﬂexibility remains unanswered.
At the same time, there are also additional opportunities for innovative business
models, which, however, have yet to be developed and evaluated. Also alternative
applications are conceivable whose challenges until today seemed unsurmountable. One
example of this is the provision of supply and disposal services to inner-city locations
(“city logistics”), which is characterized by conﬂicts and high costs. The use of autono-
mous road transport vehicles, together with other components (e.g. goods lock system)
could for instance resolve temporal conﬂicts between freight and passenger trafﬁc.
At the same time, the opportunities and risks associated with the rising automation of
transport should be analyzed in greater detail from a macroeconomic, cross-border per-
spective. This includes not only legal matters and the need for standardization, but also the
potential loss of low-level jobs. This must be analyzed in terms of alternative
labour-market scenarios. Also, to date insufﬁcient attention has been paid to the conﬂicts
that could potentially arise between autonomous road freight transport (in convoys) and
means of mass transportation. Finally, the discussion must be expanded thematically, in
order to achieve the best comprehensive assessment of environmental and resource
considerations.

Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand
Systems for Future Urban Mobility
Marco Pavone
Abstract
This chapter discusses the operational and economic aspects of autonomous
mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems, a transformative and rapidly developing mode
of transportation wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers in a given
environment. Speciﬁcally, AMoD systems are addressed along three dimensions:
(1) modeling, that is analytical models capturing salient dynamic and stochastic
features of customer demand, (2) control, that is coordination algorithms for the
vehicles aimed at throughput maximization, and (3) economic, that is ﬂeet sizing and
ﬁnancial analyses for case studies of New York City and Singapore. Collectively, the
models and methods presented in this chapter enables a rigorous assessment of the
value of AMoD systems. In particular, the case study of New York City shows that the
current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8000 robotic vehicles
(roughly 70 % of the size of the current taxi ﬂeet), while the case study of Singapore
suggests that an AMoD system can meet the personal mobility need of the entire
population of Singapore with a number of robotic vehicles roughly equal to 1/3 of the
current number of passenger vehicles. Directions for future research on AMoD systems
are presented and discussed.

Introduction
19.1.1 Personal Urban Mobility in the Twenty-First Century
In the past century, private automobiles have dramatically changed the paradigm of
personal urban mobility by enabling fast and anytime point-to-point travel within cities.
However, this paradigm is currently challenged due to a combination of factors such as
dependency on oil, tailpipe production of greenhouse gases, reduced throughput caused
by congestion, and ever-increasing demands on urban land for parking spaces [1]. In the
US, urban vehicles consume more than half of the oil consumed by all sectors [2], and
produce 20 % of the total carbon dioxide emissions [3, 4]. Congestion has soared dra-
matically in the recent past, due to the fact that construction of new roads has not kept up
with increasing transportation demand [5]. In 2011, congestion in metropolitan areas
increased urban Americans’ travel times by 5.5 billion hours (causing a 1 % loss of
US GDP [6]), and this ﬁgure is projected to increase by 50 % by 2020 [6]. Parking
compounds the congestion problem, by causing additional congestion and by competing
for urban land for other uses. The problem is even worse at a global scale, due the
combined impact of rapid increases in urban population (to reach 5 billion, more than
60 % of the world population, by 2030 [7]), worldwide urban population density, and car
ownership in developing countries [1]. As a result, private automobiles are widely rec-
ognized as an unsustainable solution for the future of personal urban mobility [1].
19.1.2 The Rise of Mobility-on-Demand (MoD)
The challenge is to ensure the same beneﬁts of privately-owned cars while removing
dependency on non-renewable resources, minimizing pollution, and avoiding the need for
additional roads and parking spaces. A lead to a solution for this problem comes from
realizing that most of the vehicles used in urban environments are over-engineered and
underutilized. For example, a typical automobile can attain speeds well over 100 miles per
hour, whereas urban driving speeds are typically slow (in the 15- to 25-miles per hour
range [5, 8]). Furthermore, private automobiles are parked more than 90 % of the time [5].
Within this context, one of the most promising strategies for future personal urban
mobility is the concept of one-way vehicle sharing using small-sized, electric cars (re-
ferred to as MoD), which provides stacks and racks of light electric vehicles at closely
spaced intervals throughout a city [1]: when a person wants to go somewhere, she/he
simply walks to the nearest rack, swipes a card to pick up a vehicle, drives it to the rack
nearest to the selected destination, and drops it off.
MoD systems with electric vehicles directly target the problems of oil dependency
(assuming electricity is produced cleanly), pollution, and parking spaces via higher uti-
lization rates. Furthermore, they ensure more ﬂexibility with respect to two-way rental
systems, and provide personal, anytime mobility, in contrast to traditional taxi systems or
388

alternative one-way ridesharing concepts such as carpooling, vanpooling, and buses. As
such, MoD systems have been advocated as a key step toward sustainable personal urban
mobility in the twenty ﬁrst century [1], and the very recent success of Car2Go (a one-way
rental company operating over 10,000 two-passenger vehicles in 26 cities worldwide [9])
seems to corroborate this statement (see Fig. 19.1, left).
MoD systems, however, present a number of limitations. For example, due to the
spatio-temporal nature of urban mobility, trip origins and destination are unevenly dis-
tributed and as a consequence MoD systems inevitably tend to become unbalanced:
Vehicles will build up in some parts of a city, and become depleted at others. Addi-
tionally, MoD systems do not directly contribute to a reduction of congestion, as the same
number of vehicle miles would be traveled (indeed more, considering trips to rebalance
the vehicles) with the same origin-destination distribution.
19.1.3 Beyond MoD: Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD)
The progress made in the ﬁeld of autonomous driving in the past decade might offer a
solution to these issues. Autonomous driving holds great promise for MoD systems
because robotic vehicles can rebalance themselves (eliminating the rebalancing problem at
its core), autonomously reach charging stations when needed, and enable system-wide
coordination aimed at throughput optimization. Furthermore, they would free passengers
from the task of driving, provide a personal mobility option to people unable or unwilling
to drive, and potentially increase safety. These beneﬁts have recently prompted a number of
companies and traditional car manufacturers to aggressively pursue the “AMoD technol-
ogy,” with activities ranging from the design of vehicles speciﬁcally tailored to autono-
mous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) operations [10, 11], to the expected launch by Google
of a 100-vehicle AMoD pilot project within the next two years [12] (see Fig. 19.1, right).

Rapid advances in vehicle automation technologies coupled with the increased eco-
nomic and societal interest in MoD systems have fueled heated debates about the potential
of AMoD systems and their economic and societal value. How many robotic vehicles
would be needed to achieve a certain quality of service? What would be the cost for their
operation? Would AMoD systems decrease congestion? In general, do AMoD systems
represent an economically viable, sustainable, and societally-acceptable solution to the
future of personal urban mobility?
19.1.4 Chapter Contributions
To answer the above questions, one needs to ﬁrst understand how to control AMoD
systems, which entails optimally routing in real-time potentially hundreds of thousands of
robotic vehicles. Such routing process must take into account the spatiotemporal vari-
ability of mobility demand, together with a number of constraints such as congestion and
battery recharging. This represents a networked, heterogeneous, stochastic decision
problem with uncertain information, hence complexity is at its heart. Within this context,
the contribution of this chapter is threefold:
1. We present a spatial queueing-theoretical model for AMoD systems capturing salient
dynamic and stochastic features of customer demand. A spatial queueing model entails
an exogenous dynamical process that generates “transportation requests” at spatially-
localized queues.
2. We outline two recent, yet promising approaches for the analysis and control of AMoD
systems, which leverage the aforementioned spatial queueing-theoretical model. The
ﬁrst approach, referred to as “lumped” approach, exploits the theory of Jackson net-
works and allows the computation of key performance metrics and the design of
system-wide coordination algorithms. The second approach, referred to as “dis-
tributed” approach, transforms the problem of controlling a set of spatially-localized
queues into one of controlling a single “spatially-averaged” queue and allows the
determination of analytic scaling laws that can be used to select system parameters
(e.g., ﬂeet sizing).
3. We discuss two case studies for the deployment of AMoD systems in New York City
and Singapore. These case studies suggest that it is much more affordable (and con-
venient) to access mobility in an AMoD system compared to traditional mobility
systems based on private vehicle ownership.
The chapter concludes with a discussion about future directions for research, with a
preliminary discussion about the potential of AMoD systems to decrease congestion. The
results presented in this chapter build upon a number of previous works by the author and
his collaborators, namely [13] for the lumped approach, [14–17] for the spatial
queueing-theoretical framework and the distributed approach, and [13, 18] for the case
studies.

The rest of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 19.2 presents a spatial
queueing model for AMoD systems and gives an overview of two complementary
approaches to control AMoD systems, namely, the lumped approach and the distributed
approach. Section 19.3 leverages analysis and control synthesis tools from Sect. 19.2 to
provide an initial evaluation of AMoD systems for two case studies of New York City and
Singapore. Section 19.4 outlines directions for future research, with a particular emphasis
on (and some preliminary results for) congestion effects. Finally, Sect. 19.5 concludes the
chapter.
19.2
Modeling and Controlling AMoD Systems
19.2.1 Spatial Queueing Model of AMoD Systems
At a high level, an AMoD system can be mathematically modeled as follows. Consider a
given environment, where a ﬂeet of self-driving vehicles fulﬁlls transportation requests.
Transportation requests arrive according to an exogenous dynamical process with asso-
ciated origin and destination locations within the environment. The transportation request
arrival process and the spatial distribution of the origin-destination pairs are modeled as
stochastic processes, leading to a probabilistic analysis. Transportation requests queue up
within the environment, which gives rise to a network of spatially-localized queues
dynamically served by the self-driving vehicles. Such network is referred to as “spatial
queueing system.” Performance criteria include the availability of vehicles upon the
request’s arrival (i.e., the probability that at least one vehicle is available to provide
immediate service) or average wait times to receive service. The model is portrayed in
Fig. 19.2.
Controlling a spatial queueing system involves a joint task allocation and scheduling
problem, whereby vehicle routes should be dynamically designed to allocate vehicles to
transportation requests so as to minimize, for example, wait times. In such a dynamic and
stochastic setup, one needs to design a closed-loop control policy, as opposed to

open-loop preplanned routes. The problem combines aspects of networked control,
queueing theory, combinatorial optimization, and geometric probability (i.e., probabilistic
analysis in a geometrical setting). This precludes the direct application of “traditional”
queueing theory due to the complexity added by the spatial component (these complex-
ities include, for example, congestion effects on network edges, energy constraints, and
statistical couplings induced by the vehicles’ motion [17, 19, 20]). It also precludes the
direct application of combinatorial static optimization, as the dynamic aspect of the
problem implies that the problem instance is incrementally revealed over time and static
methods can no longer be applied. As a consequence, researchers have devised a number
of alternative approaches, as detailed in the next section.
19.2.2 Approaches for Controlling AMoD Systems
This section presents two recent, yet promising approaches for the control of spatial
queueing systems as models for AMoD systems, namely the lumped approach and the
distributed approach. Both approaches employ a number of relaxations and approxima-
tions to overcome the difﬁculties in directly applying results from queueing (network)
theory to spatial queueing models. A remarkable feature of these approaches is that they
yield formal performance bounds for the control policies (i.e., factor of sub-optimality)
and scaling laws for the quality of service in terms of model data, which can provide
useful guidelines for selecting system parameters (e.g., number of vehicles). These
approaches take their origin from seminal works on hypercube models for spatial queues
[19], on the Dynamic Traveling Repairman problem [20–23], and on the Dynamic Trafﬁc
Assignment problem [24, 25].
Alternative approaches could be developed by leveraging worst-case (as opposed to
stochastic) techniques for dynamic vehicle routing, e.g., competitive (online) analysis
[26–28]. This is an interesting direction for future research.
19.2.2.1
Lumped Approach
Within the lumped approach [13], customers are assumed to arrive at a set of stations
located within a given environment,1 similar to the hypercube model [19]. The arrival
process at each station is Poisson with a rate λi, where i 2 {1, …, N} and N denotes the
number of stations. (Reasonable deviations from the assumption of Poisson arrivals have
been found not to substantially alter the predictive accuracy of these models [19].) Upon
arrival, a customer at station i selects a destination j according to a probability mass
1Alternatively, to model an AMoD system where the vehicles directly pick up the customers, one
would decompose a city into N disjoint regions Q1, Q2, …, QN. Such regions would replace the
notion of stations. When a customer arrives in region Qi, destined for Qj, a free vehicle in Qi is sent
to pick up and drop off the customer before parking at the median of Qj. The two models are then
formally identical and follow the same mathematical treatment.

function {pij} (Fig. 19.3, left). If vehicles are parked at station i, the customer takes a
vehicle and is driven to the intended destination, with a travel time modeled as a random
variable Tij. However, if the station is empty of vehicles, the customer immediately leaves
the system. Under the assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponentially-distributed travel
times, an AMoD system is then translated into a Jackson network model through an
abstraction procedure [13, 29], whereby one identiﬁes the stations with single-server
queues and the roads with inﬁnite-server queues. (Jackson networks are a class of
queueing networks where the equilibrium distribution is particularly simple to compute as
the network has a product-form solution [30, 31].) With this identiﬁcation, an AMoD
system becomes a closed Jackson network with respect to the vehicles, which is amenable
to analytical treatment [13] (Fig. 19.3, left).
To control the network, for example, to (autonomously) rebalance the vehicles to
ensure even vehicle availability, the strategy is to add virtual customer streams [13].
Speciﬁcally, one assumes that each station i generates “virtual customers” according to a
Poisson process with rate ψi, and routes these virtual customers to station j with proba-
bility αij. The problem of controlling an AMoD system becomes one of optimizing over
the rates {ψi} and probabilities {αij} which, by exploiting the theory of Jackson networks,
can be cast as a linear program (hence, this approach extends well to large transportation
networks). This method encourages coordination but does not enforce it, which is the key
to maintaining tractability of the model [13]. The rates {ψi} and probabilities {αij} are then
used as feedforward reference signals in a receding horizon control scheme to control in
real-time an entire AMoD system [13], as done for case studies of New York City and
Singapore presented in Sect. 19.3.
Fig. 19.3 Left figure In the lumped model, an AMoD system is modeled as a Jackson network,
where stations are identified with single-server queues and roads are identified with infinite-server
queues. (Customers are denoted with yellow dots and servicing vehicles are represented by small car
icons.) Some vehicles travel without passengers to rebalance the fleet. Right figure In a distributed
model of an AMoD system, a stochastic process with rate λ generates origin-destination pairs,
distributed over a continuous domain Q
19
Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems for Future Urban Mobility
393
19.2.2.2
Distributed Approach
The key idea behind the distributed approach [14–17] is that the number of stations
represents a continuum (i.e., N →∞), similar to the Dynamic Traveling Repairman
problem [20–23]. In other words, customers arrive at any point in a given bounded
environment [15, 16], or at any point along the segments of a road map [15]. In the
simplest scenario, a dynamical process generates spatially localized origin-destination
requests in a geographical region Q  R2: The process that generates origin-destination
requests is modeled as a spatiotemporal Poisson process, namely, (i) the time between
consecutive generation instants has an exponential distribution with intensity λ, and
(ii) origins and destination are random variables with probability density functions,
respectively, uO and uD; supported over Q, see Fig. 19.3 (right). The objective is to
design a routing policy that minimizes the average steady-state time delay between the
generation of an origin-destination pair and the time the trip is completed. By removing
the constraint that customers’ origin-destination requests are localized at a ﬁnite set of
points in an environment, one transforms the problem of controlling N different queues
into one of controlling a single “spatially-averaged” queue. This considerably simpliﬁes
analysis and control, and allows one to derive analytical expressions for important design
parameters. For example, one can show that a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
stability is that the load factor
q :¼ k½EuOuD½Y  X þ EMDðuOuDÞðvmÞ
ð19:1Þ
is strictly less than one, where m is the number of servicing vehicles, v is the average
speed of the vehicles, EuOuD½Y  X is the expected distance between origin and desti-
nation locations, and EMDðuOuDÞ is the earth mover’s distance between densities uO and
uD [32], representing the minimum distance, on average, a vehicle must travel to realign
itself with an asymmetrical travel demand [16]. Intuitively, if distributions uO and uD are
imagined as describing two piles each consisting of a unit of “dirt” (i.e., earth), then
EMDðuO uDÞ can be thought of as the minimum work (dirt × distance) required to
reshape uO into uD (see [32] for a formal deﬁnition). One can use the above formula to
estimate the required ﬂeet size to ensure stability—an example application to a case study
of Singapore is presented in Sect. 19.3. With this approach, it is also possible to obtain
formal performance bounds (i.e., factors of sub-optimality) for receding horizon control
policies, in the asymptotic regimes ρ →1−(heavy-load, system saturated) and ρ →0+
(light-load, system empty of customers) [17, 33].
19.2.3 Comparison
The lumped approach and the distributed approach are complementary in a number of
ways. Both models provide formal guarantees for stability and performance. The former
is more realistic (a road topology can be readily mapped into this model) and provides a
394
M. Pavone
natural pathway to synthesize control policies. The latter provides signiﬁcant mathemat-
ical simpliﬁcations (as one only needs to study a spatially-averaged queue) and enables
the determination of analytic scaling laws that can be used to select system parameters
(e.g., ﬂeet sizing). In the next section we exploit the interplay between these two
approaches to characterize AMoD systems for case studies of New York City and
Singapore.
Both approaches appear to be promising tools to systematically tackle the problem of
system-wide control of AMoD systems. Several research questions, however, still need to
be addressed to fulﬁll this objective, particularly with respect to inclusion of congestion
effects (in Sect. 19.2.2.1, roads are modeled as inﬁnite server queues, so the travel time for
each vehicle is independent of all other vehicles), predictive accuracy, and control syn-
thesis for complex scenarios, as detailed in Sect. 19.4.
19.3
Evaluating AMoD Systems
Leveraging models and methods from Sect. 19.2, this section studies hypothetical
deployments of AMoD systems in two major cities, namely New York City and Singa-
pore. Collectively, the results presented in this section provide a preliminary, yet rigorous
evaluation of the beneﬁts of AMoD systems based on real-world data. We mention that
both case studies do not consider congestion effects—a preliminary discussion about these
effects is presented in Sect. 19.4.
19.3.1 Case Study I: AMoD in New York City
This case study applies the lumped approach to characterize how many self-driving
vehicles in an AMoD system would be required to replace the current ﬂeet of taxis in
Manhattan while providing quality service at current customer demand levels [13]. In
2012, over 13,300 taxis in New York City made over 15 million trips a month or 500,000
trips a day, with around 85 % of trips within Manhattan. The study uses taxi trip data
collected on March 1, 2012 (the data is courtesy of the New York City Taxi and
Limousine Commission) consisting of 439,950 trips within Manhattan. First, trip origins
and destinations are clustered into N = 100 stations, so that a demand is on average less
than 300 m from the nearest station, or approximately a 3-min walk. The system
parameters such as arrival rates {λi}, destination preferences {pij} and travel times {Tij}
are estimated for each hour of the day using trip data between each pair of stations.
Vehicle availability (i.e., probability of ﬁnding a vehicle when walking to a station) is
calculated for 3 cases peak demand (29,485 demands/h, 7–8 pm), low demand (1982
demands/h, 4–5 am), and average demand (16,930 demands/h, 4–5 pm). For each case,
vehicle availability is calculated by solving the linear program discussed in Sect. 19.2.2.1
and then applying mean value analysis [29] techniques to recover vehicle availabilities.
19
Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems for Future Urban Mobility
395
(The interested reader is referred to [13] for further details.) The results are summarized in
Fig. 19.4.
For high vehicle availability (say, 95 %), one would need around 8000 vehicles
(*70 % of the current ﬂeet size operating in Manhattan, which, based on taxi trip data,
we approximate as 85 % of the total taxi ﬂeet) at peak demand and 6000 vehicles at
average demand. This suggests that an AMoD system with 8000 vehicles would be able to
meet 95 % of the taxi demand in Manhattan, assuming 5 % of passengers are impatient
and are lost when a vehicle is not immediately available. However, in a real system,
passengers would wait in line for the next vehicle rather than leave the system, thus it is
important to determine how vehicle availability relates to customer waiting times. Cus-
tomer waiting times are characterized through simulation, using the receding horizon
control scheme mentioned in Sect. 19.2.2.1. The time-varying system parameters λi, pij,
and average speed are piecewise constant, and change each hour based on values esti-
mated from the taxi data. Travel times Tij are based on average speed and Manhattan
distance between stations i and j, and self-driving vehicle rebalancing is performed every
15 min. Three sets of simulations are performed for 6000, 7000, and 8000 vehicles, and
the resulting average waiting times are shown in Fig. 19.4 (right). Speciﬁcally, Fig. 19.4
(right) shows that for a 7000 vehicle ﬂeet the peak averaged wait time is less than 5 min
(9–10 am) and, for 8000 vehicles, the average wait time is only 2.5 min. The simulation
results show that high availability (90–95 %) does indeed correspond to low customer
wait time and that an AMoD system with 7000–8000 vehicles (roughly 70 % of the size
of the current taxi ﬂeet) can provide adequate service with current taxi demand levels in
Manhattan.

19.3.2 Case Study II: AMoD in Singapore
This case study discusses an hypothetical deployment of an AMoD system to meet the
personal mobility need of the entire population of Singapore [18]. The study, which
should be interpreted as a thought experiment to investigate the potential beneﬁts of an
AMoD solution, addresses three main dimensions (i) minimum ﬂeet size to ensure system
stability (i.e., uniform boundedness of the number of outstanding customers), (ii) ﬂeet size
to provide acceptable quality of service at current customer demand levels, and (iii) ﬁ-
nancial estimates to assess economic feasibility. To support the analysis, three comple-
mentary data sources are used, namely the 2008 Household Interview Travel Survey—
HITS—(a comprehensive survey about transportation patterns conducted by the Land
Transport Authority in 2008 [34]), the Singapore Taxi Data—STD—database (a database
of taxi records collected over the course of a week in Singapore in 2012) and the Sin-
gapore Road Network—SRD—(a graph-based representation of Singapore’s road
network).
19.3.2.1
Minimum Fleet Sizing
The minimum ﬂeet size needed to ensure stability is computed by applying Eq. (19.1),
which was derived within the distributed approach. The ﬁrst step is to process the HITS,
STD, and SRD data sources to estimate the arrival rate λ, the average origin-destination
distance EuOuD½Y  X; the demand distributions uO and uD; and the average velocity
v. Given such quantities, Eq. (19.1) yields that at least 92,693 self-driving vehicles are
required to ensure the transportation demand remains uniformly bounded. To gain an
appreciation for the level of vehicle sharing possible in an AMoD system of this size,
consider that at 1,144,400 households in Singapore, there would be roughly one shared
car every 12.3 households. Note, however, that this should only be seen as a lower bound
on the ﬂeet size, since customer waiting times would be unacceptably high.
19.3.2.2
Fleet Sizing for Acceptable Quality of Service
To ensure acceptable quality of service, one needs to increase the ﬂeet size. To charac-
terize such increase, we use the same techniques outlined in Sect. 19.3.1, which rely on
the lumped approach. Vehicle availability is analyzed in two representative cases. The ﬁrst
is chosen as the 2–3 pm bin, since it is the one that is the closest to the “average” trafﬁc
condition. The second case considers the 7–8 am rush-hour peak. Results are summarized
in Fig. 19.5 (left). With about 200,000 vehicles availability is about 90 % on average, but
drops to about 50 % at peak times. With 300,000 vehicles in the ﬂeet, availability is about
95 % on average and about 72 % at peak times. As in Sect. 19.3.1, waiting times are
characterized through simulation. For 250,000 vehicles, the maximum wait times during
peak hours is around 30 min, which is comparable with typical congestion delays during
rush hour. With 300,000 vehicles, peak wait times are reduced to less than 15 min, see
Fig. 19.5 (right). To put these numbers into perspective, in 2011 there were 779,890
passenger vehicles operating in Singapore [35]. Hence, this case study suggests that an
19
Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems for Future Urban Mobility
397
AMoD system can meet the personal mobility need of the entire population of Singapore
with a number of robotic vehicles roughly equal to 1/3 of the current number of passenger
vehicles.
19.3.2.3
Financial Analysis of AMoD Systems
This section provides a preliminary, yet rigorous economic evaluation of AMoD systems.
Speciﬁcally, this section characterizes the total mobility cost (TMC) for users in two
competing transportation models. In System 1 (referred to as traditional system), users
access personal mobility by purchasing (or leasing) a private, human-driven vehicle.
Conversely, in System 2 (the AMoD system), users access personal mobility by sub-
scribing to a shared AMoD ﬂeet of vehicles. For both systems, the analysis considers not
only the explicit costs of access to mobility (referred to as cost of service—COS), but also
hidden costs attributed to the time invested in various mobility-related activities (referred
to as cost of time—COT). A subscript i = {1, 2} will denote the system under consid-
eration (e.g., COS1 denotes the COS for System 1).
Cost of service: The cost of service is deﬁned as the sum of all explicit costs associated
with accessing mobility. For example, in System 1, COS1 reﬂects the costs to individually
purchase, service, park, insure, and fuel a private, human-driven vehicle, which, for the
case of Singapore, is estimated for a mid-size car at $18,162/year. For System 2, one
needs to make an educated guess for the cost incurred with retroﬁtting production vehicles
with the sensors, actuators, and computational power required for automated driving.
Based upon the author’s and his collaborators’ experience on self-driving vehicles, such
cost (assuming some economies of scale for large ﬂeets) is estimated as a one-time fee of
$15,000. From the ﬂeet-sizing arguments of Sect. 19.3.2.2, one shared self-driving vehicle
in System 2 can effectively serve the role of about 4 private, human-driven vehicles in
System 1, which implies an estimate of 2.5 years for the average lifespan of a self-driving

vehicle. Tallying the aforementioned costs on a ﬂeet-wide scale and distributing the sum
evenly among the entire Singapore population gives a COS2 of $12,563/year (see [18] for
further details about the cost breakdown). According to COS values, it is more affordable
to access mobility in System 2 than System 1.
Cost of time: To monetize the hidden costs attributed to the time invested in
mobility-related activities, the analysis leverages the Value of Travel Time Savings
(VTTS) numbers laid out by the Department of Transportation for performing a Cost
Beneﬁt Analysis of transportation scenarios in the US. Applying the appropriate VTTS
values based on actual driving patterns gives COT1 = $14,460/year (which considers an
estimated 747 h/year spent by vehicle owners in Singapore in mobility-related activities,
see [18]). To compute COT2, this analysis prices sitting comfortably in a shared
self-driving vehicle while being able to work, read, or simply relax at 20 % of the median
wage (as opposed to 50 % of the median wage which is the cost of time for driving in
free-ﬂowing trafﬁc). Coupling this ﬁgure with the facts that a user would spend no time
parking, limited time walking to and from the vehicles, and roughly 5 min for a requested

AMoD systems is provided in Table 19.1 (note that the average Singaporean drives
18,997 km in a year [18]). Remarkably, combining COS and COT ﬁgures, the TMC for
AMoD systems is roughly half of that for traditional systems. To put this into perspective,
these savings represent about one third of GDP per capita. Hence, this analysis suggests it
is much more affordable to access mobility in an AMoD system compared to traditional
mobility systems based on private vehicle ownership.

Future Research Directions
This chapter provided an overview of modeling and control techniques for AMoD sys-
tems, and a preliminary evaluation of their ﬁnancial beneﬁts. Future research on this topic
should proceed along two main dimensions: efﬁcient control algorithms for increasingly
more realistic models and eventually for real-world test beds, and ﬁnancial analyses for
a larger number of deployment options and accounting for positive externalities

(e.g., increased safety) in the economic assessment. Such research directions are discussed
in some details next, with a particular emphasis on the inclusion of congestion effects and
some related preliminary results.
19.4.1 Future Research on Modeling and Control
A key direction for future research is the inclusion of congestion effects. In AMoD
systems, congestion manifests itself as constraints on the road capacity, which in turn
affect travel times throughout the system. To include congestion effects, a promising
strategy is to study a modiﬁed lumped model whereby the inﬁnite-server road queues are
changed to queues with a ﬁnite number of servers, where the number of servers on each
road represents the capacity of that road. This approach is used in Fig. 19.6 on a simple
9-station road network, where the aim is to illustrate the impact of autonomously rebal-
ancing vehicles on congestion. Speciﬁcally, the stations are placed on a square grid, and
joined by 2-way road segments each of which is 0.5 km long. Each road consists of a
single lane, with a critical density of 80 vehicles/km. Each vehicle travels at 30 km/h in
free ﬂow, which means the travel time along each road segment is 1 min in free ﬂow.
Figure 19.6 plots the vehicle and road utilization increases due to rebalancing for 500
randomly generated systems (where the arrival rates and routing distributions are ran-
domly generated). The routing algorithm for the rebalancing vehicles is a simple

open-loop strategy based on the linear program discussed in Sect. 19.2.2.1. The x-axis
shows the ratio of rebalancing vehicles to passenger vehicles on the road, which represents
the inherent imbalance in the system. The red data points represent the increase in average
road utilization due to rebalancing and the blue data points represent the utilization
increase in the most congested road segment due to rebalancing. It is no surprise that the
average road utilization rate is a linear function of the number of rebalancing vehicles.
However, remarkably, the maximum congestion increases are much lower than the
average, and are in most cases zero. This means that while rebalancing generally increases
the number of vehicles on the road, rebalancing vehicles mostly travel along less con-
gested routes and rarely increase the maximum congestion in the system. This can be seen
in Fig. 19.6 bottom left, where rebalancing clearly increases the number of vehicles on
many roads but not on the most congested road segment (from station 6 to station 5).
The simple setup in Fig. 19.6 suggests that AMoD systems would, in general, not lead
to an increase in congestion. On the other end, a particularly interesting and intriguing
research direction is to devise routing algorithms for AMoD systems that lead to a de-
crease in congestion with current demand levels (or even higher). A promising strategy
relies on the idea that if AMoD systems are implemented such that passengers are given
precise pickup times and trips are staggered to avoid too many trips at the same time,
congestion may be reduced. Passengers may still spend the same amount of time between
requesting a vehicle and arrival at their destination, but the time spent waiting for the
vehicle could be used for productive work as opposed to being stuck in trafﬁc. Speciﬁ-
cally, for highly congested systems, vehicle departures can be staggered to avoid exces-
sive congestion, and the routing problem is similar to the simultaneous departure and
routing problem [36].
Besides congestion, several additional directions are open for future research. As far as
modeling is concerned, those include (i) analysis in a time-varying setup (e.g., with
periodically time-varying arrival rates), (ii) inclusion of mesoscopic and microscopic
effects into the models (e.g., increased throughput due to platooning or automated
intersections), and (iii) more complex models for the transportation demands (e.g., time
windows or priorities). On the control side, those include (i) inclusion of recharging
constraints in the routing process, (ii) control of AMoD systems as part of a multi-modal
transportation network, which should address synergies between AMoD and alternative
transportation modes and interactions with human-driven vehicles, and (iii) deployment of
control algorithms on real-world test beds.
19.4.2 Future Research on AMoD Evaluation
The AMoD evaluation presented in Sect. 19.3 already showed that AMoD systems might
hold signiﬁcant ﬁnancial beneﬁts. Remarkably, such ﬁnancial beneﬁts might be even
larger when one also accounts for the positive externalities of an AMoD system, e.g.,
improved safety, freeing up urban land for other uses, and even creating a new economy
19

based on infotainment systems onboard the self-driving vehicles. Such additional beneﬁts,
however, have not been thoroughly characterized yet and require additional analyses.
Another research direction involves the evaluation of AMoD systems for more complex
deployment options, e.g., as a last-mile solution within a multi-modal transportation
system, or with a more sophisticated service structure, e.g., multiple priority classes.
19.5
Conclusions
This chapter overviewed recent results regarding the modeling, control, and evaluation of
AMoD systems. Case studies of New York City and Singapore suggest that it would be
much more affordable (and more convenient) to access mobility in an AMoD system
compared to traditional mobility systems based on private vehicle ownership. More
studies are however needed to devise efﬁcient, system-wide coordination algorithms for
complex AMoD systems as part of a multi-modal transportation network, and to fully
assess the related economic beneﬁts.

Safety and Security
Autonomous driving must be safe—this demand’s legitimacy is beyond dispute. But what
needs to be considered for this desired state to be achieved? Entry into this topic is via
machine perception, which is ultimately viewed as an enabling technology for autono-
mous driving. Naturally, only what is recognized as being certain can also be used in a
decision on safe driving. Can it be ensured that machine perception exhibits the quality
required for safety, and if so, how? What are the options for classifying perception
performance onboard, what limits cannot be exceeded, and how are these to be evaluated
for the development of autonomous driving? These are the core questions of Klaus
Dietmayer’s chapter, Possibility of Predicting Machine Perception for Automated
Driving.
If the demands of autonomous vehicles have been successfully deﬁned and imple-
mented, there remains the challenge of verifying and validating whether these demands
are really fulﬁlled in the present execution. Among the experts, there is unanimity that
release for production cannot be given with today’s testing and validation methods. In
their chapter, The Release of Autonomous Vehicles, Walther Wachenfeld and Hermann
Winner explain the challenges and outline approaches that could form components of new
tool chains for validating safety.
At the beginning of their driving careers, even human beings’ driving skills are far
from what they will be later on. The accident frequency of young (male) drivers in
particular is witness to that. With growing experience, the safety of drivers improves
considerably. People learn to drive safely. Under the title Do Autonomous Vehicles
Learn?, and based on an intensive study of the literature, Walther Wachenfeld and
Hermann Winner discuss the extent to which machine learning can meet autonomous
driving’s safety requirements.
Taking the pivotal ISO 26262 standard as his starting point, Andreas Reschka exam-
ines when autonomous vehicles generally, and particularly in the use cases, are in a safe
state; how degradations could be designed more safely; and what is required of a Safety
Concept for Autonomous Vehicles.
Hermann Winner and Markus Maurer
In his article Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making Usable
Additional Data, Kai Rannenberg explains that, although open interfaces and communi-
cation with participants outside the vehicle may be helpful from the point of view of
validating safety and functionality, they may be very questionable in terms of data pro-
tection and data integrity. He argues that machine autonomy may even be linked to a loss
in privacy, though perhaps this need not be so.

Introduction
In the case of highly-automated and fully-automated driving it is necessary for the vehicle
itself to recognize the limitations of its machine perception, as well as the functional
limitations of processing modules based on this perception to react adequately. While
simulator studies of highly-automated driving have shown that realistic transfer times to
the driver of between 5 and 10 s can be assumed [1, 2] before the driver can reliably take
over the driving task again, with fully-automated driving a human would not provide any
backup whatsoever. In the case of functional limitations, the vehicle would have to be able
to achieve an intrinsically safe state completely by itself. However, potential transfer times
of 5 s and more require extensive autonomy of the vehicle, if only for a limited time, in
order to be able to bridge this time period reliably under all circumstances.
To be able to achieve this degree of autonomy, the vehicle must perceive its sur-
roundings, interpret them appropriately and be able to derive and execute reliable actions
continuously. Technically, this task is carried out by individual processing modules that
build on each other. A simpliﬁed representation of the relationships is shown in Fig. 20.1.
The machine perception of the vehicle’s surroundings is enabled by various sensors,
such as cameras or radar sensors, incorporated into the vehicle. Further information about
the static driving environment is usually added from very precise digital maps. However,
this can only be used when the vehicle knows its exact position. Therefore, the vehicle
also requires a self-localization functional module for the map matching. The result of the
machine perception is a dynamic vehicle environment model in which the vehicle itself
and all other road users are represented by individual dynamic motion models. This

should also contain all the relevant infrastructure elements such as trafﬁc signs and trafﬁc
lights, as well as structuring elements such as trafﬁc islands and curbstones, road markings
for dividing trafﬁc lanes, closed areas or pedestrian crossings.
Based on this vehicle environment model, during the situation recognition, all the
individual components are set in relation to each other in order to generate a machine
interpretation of the scene from the dependencies of the individual elements. In the
situation prediction module based on this, various possible developments of the scene
over time, also known as episodes, are calculated in advance and evaluated as to the
probability of their occurrence. Therefore, in this document an episode refers to a possible
speciﬁc development over time for a detected trafﬁc scene, whereby the time horizon lies
within the range of a few seconds. On the basis of this situational information, the module
based on this determines the higher-level action planning. For example, it could stipulate
driving around an obstacle or overtaking a slower vehicle. For the execution of the plans,
possible trajectories of the vehicle are calculated with a typical time horizon of 3–5 s and
are evaluated in terms of safety and comfort. The optimal trajectory based on the criteria
that can be stipulated is executed by the vehicle control. The processing procedure
described is repeated continuously, usually in line with the data capture of the sensors, so
that the vehicle is able to react to the actions and reactions of other road users.
The description of this technical process chain clearly shows that a failure of the
machine perception would immediately lead to uncertainties in the situation evaluation of
such a magnitude that reliable safe action planning and action execution would no longer
be possible. The degradation of the machine interpretation of the scene and the action
planning and action execution based on this depends on the situation; however, reliable
prediction would typically not be able to exceed 2–3 s. Therefore, it is evident that a
minimum perception capability is required even for highly-automated driving due to the
signiﬁcantly greater transfer times to the driver. A complete failure of the machine per-
ception must be avoided in all circumstances, though of course this also applies to the
modules based on it and the vehicle control with its sensors and actuators, which are not
within the focus of this document, however.

Therefore, the question is whether limitations in the operation of the machine per-
ception can be detected or even predicted, and if they are, over what period of time. In this
context, the following sections will discuss the state of the technology of known
methodical approaches, and on this basis derive possible research questions.
20.2
Machine Perception
20.2.1 Scope and Characteristic
As described in the previous section, the task of machine perception is to reliably detect all
the other road users relevant to the operation of the automated driving, and to assign them
correctly to the trafﬁc infrastructure. This is particularly necessary because, for example, a
pedestrian at the side of the road presents a different potential risk than one who is using a
separate pedestrian walkway running parallel to the road.
For the machine perception sensors based on camera and radar and/or lidar technology
are used. More detailed information on the operation and design of these sensors can be
found in [3], for example. Cameras provide a 2D representation of a 3D scene in the form
of high-resolution gray-scale or colored images, from which image processing methods
can be used to extract individual objects when there is sufﬁcient contrast or differentiation
in the texture. However, the object distance can only be determined with mono cameras
based on assumptions that often lead to errors, such as a ﬂat surface. Although stereo
cameras also enable the object distance to be determined by means of the disparity image,
the accuracy decreases quadratically as the distance increases. With the currently pre-
vailing base distances for the stereo arrangements and the resolution of the cameras,
measuring ranges of up to around 50 m are possible without the error margin increasing to
such an extent that functions could no longer make any use of the data.
On the other hand, radar and also lidar sensors provide distance measuring data that is
comparatively very accurate and also practically distance-independent in terms of the
measuring error margin. However, due to their low angle resolution, they are less accurate
in capturing the contours, i.e. the external dimensions of objects. This applies in particular
to radar sensors. Additionally, radar and lidar sensors do not provide any texture infor-
mation. Due to these different measuring properties, the different sensor types are gen-
erally used in combination to create the machine perception. This is referred to as sensor
data fusion.
The combined sensor data enables moving and static objects, but also road surface
markings, for example, to be categorically detected and physically measured. The possible
measuring dimensions depend on the speciﬁc sensor set-up. Typical physical measured
data that can be captured includes the dimensions of an object used for a box model with
length, width and height, as well as its position absolutely in the world or relative to the
vehicle. In the case of moving objects, the object speeds and object accelerations are
added to this data. More difﬁcult to determine, and generally very unreliably, from
20
Predicting of Machine Perception for Automated Driving
409
external sensor measurements is the yaw rate or yaw angle of other road users. Without
vehicle-to-vehicle communication, these variables can only be determined reliably for
one’s own vehicle.
However, for the subsequent situation evaluation and situation prediction, not only the
physical measurement of the objects is required, but also information about what class of
object is involved. For example, a pedestrian and a motorcyclist differ in terms of their
possible degrees of freedom of movement and also their possible movement dynamic.
Also, depending on the context and constellation, road surface markings can have dif-
ferent meanings. Therefore, it is necessary also to determine the semantic meaning of the
objects detected from the sensor data, or from other information sources such as a digital
map. In the context of the machine perception, this operation is known as a classiﬁcation
step, but it is a component of the machine perception.
While humans are able to assign a semantic meaning to the visual perceptions very
quickly and nearly without errors, this is still a comparatively difﬁcult task for the machine
perception with the current state of the technology. The known classiﬁcation algorithms
are always based on more or less complex models of expected object classes, which are
either learned automatically from examples or are speciﬁed manually. These models then
display, as discriminately as possible, characteristics that can be captured with the
available sensors, so that a distinction can be made between the object classes that occur.
However, it also becomes clear that object classes that are not trained in advance cannot
be identiﬁed semantically with the methods known at present. Due to their signiﬁcantly
greater capabilities, learning classiﬁcation algorithms have become widely accepted.
A machine perception with semantic information is only technically possible in the
context of driver assistance systems and automated driving because the driving area is
well structured and limited to a few object classes. Additionally, only a rough class
differentiation is relevant for situation recognition and situation prediction. With the
current state of the technology, it is sufﬁcient to be able to distinguish between the
pedestrian, cyclist, passenger car and truck or bus classes with respect to moving objects.
Additionally, there are stationary obstacles, but these are usually assigned to a residue
class along with the non-classiﬁable objects.
For the correct assignment of the classiﬁed objects to the trafﬁc infrastructure, it is also
necessary to be able to identify reliably, with the correct semantic meaning, road surface
markings, blocked areas, stop lines, trafﬁc light systems and trafﬁc signs. As this complex
classiﬁcation task is not yet possible with the required degree of reliability, highly accurate
and comprehensively attributed digital maps are used as a support, based on the state of
the technology. Knowing its own position, the automated vehicle can use these maps to
identify the stationary objects and markings expected in the sensors’ ﬁeld of vision,
together with their semantic meaning. The sensors then only have to verify that the objects
are present.
410
K. Dietmayer
A disadvantage of this approach is that a highly accurate localization of the vehicle is
required, for which a standard GPS localization is not sufﬁcient, and the map must always
be up to date. For this reason, the goal is to develop technical solutions in the future that
will no longer require highly accurate, up-to-date maps.
20.2.2 Characteristics of Environment Models
The machine perception is used to create a dynamic environment model. Two main
representations are known: object-based and grid-based forms. Both forms of represen-
tation can also be combined.
An object-based vehicle environment model is a dynamic data structure in which all the
relevant object and infrastructure elements in the vicinity of the vehicle are represented
correctly in space and time. As explained above, the capturing and tracking over time of
the objects and infrastructure elements is performed continuously by suitable, usually
fused on-board sensors such as cameras, radars, lidars, and with the additional use of
highly accurate digital maps. Figure 20.2 shows an example of components that incor-
porate an environment representation.
Which objects and structure elements are relevant for automated driving mainly
depends on the driving task to be performed, the complexity of which increases starkly,
starting from simple motorway scenarios via country roads to inner-city trafﬁc. In the
object-based representation, all the other road users relevant to the representation, the
relevant infrastructure elements and one’s own vehicle itself are described by means of a
separate dynamic object model, usually a time-discrete state space model. The states of
this model, such as position, speed or 2D/3D object dimensions, are continuously updated
in line with the sensor measurements. Furthermore, there is continuous capturing of the
road surface markings and trafﬁc signs, as well as the status of the trafﬁc light systems.

A grid-based representation uses raster maps to divide the stationary environment into
localized cells of equal size. The vehicle moves across this localized 2D or 3D grid and
the on-board, the sensors then only supply information as to whether speciﬁc cells are free
and thus can be driven on freely, or whether there is an obstacle in the respective cell.
Additionally, the state in which no information on cells is available can also be modeled.
This type of depiction is mainly suitable for representing static scenarios and static
obstacles. It does not require any model hypotheses about the object classes to be expected
and can therefore be categorized as very resistant to model errors. Figure 20.3 shows the
basic procedure. Further information on grid-based representations can be found in [4–8].

Methods for Dealing with Uncertainties of Machine
Perception
20.3.1 Uncertainty Domains
As described in Sect. 20.2, the machine perception is made up of different task scopes.
These are, on the one hand, detecting static and dynamic objects and physically measuring
them as precisely as possible, and on the other, assigning the correct semantic meanings to
the detected objects. In the context of these tasks, the following three uncertainty domains
exist for the machine perception:
1. State uncertainty
State uncertainty describes the uncertainty in the physical measured variables, such as
size, position and speed, and is a direct consequence of measuring errors in the sensors
and sensor signal processing that cannot always be avoided.

2. Existence uncertainty
Existence uncertainty describes the uncertainty as to whether an object detected by the
sensors and transferred to the representation of the surroundings actually exists at all.
Errors of this kind can occur due to deﬁciencies in the signal processing algorithms or
incorrect measurements by the sensors themselves.
3. Class uncertainty
This refers to uncertainty with regard to the correct semantic assignment, which can be
caused by deﬁciencies in the classiﬁcation procedure or insufﬁciently accurate mea-
sured data.
In order to facilitate automated driving, it is necessary to reliably detect any uncer-
tainties or errors in the various domains and, if possible, even to be able to predict them. In
the current state of the technology, uncertainties are handled, almost without exception,
using methods based on Bayes’ theorem [9–11] or on the generalization of same, the
Dempster-Shafer theory [12]. The advantage of these methods is that they allow the
uncertainty domains to be handled using a totally probabilistic and therefore mainly
heuristic-free approach.
In the narrow sense, the uncertainty domains named above only apply to the on-board
sensors for now. However, errors in the information from a digital map or in the data
obtained via Car2x communication can also be categorized. Car2x communication in
particular can harbor additional sources of error due to possible variable latency times in
the transfer of data and the possibility of imprecisely known uncertainty evaluations of the
sending sources. However, the effects can still be assigned to the three uncertainty
domains named, and therefore we will not go into further detail here.
20.3.2 State Uncertainty
The state uncertainty of a detected object is described, in accordance with Bayes’ theorem,
by means of a probability density function which can be used to determine the most
probable total and individual state and also, with a certain probability, possible variations
from this. In the case of a multi-dimensional, normally distributed probability density
function, the state uncertainty is completely represented by a covariance matrix.
In estimating static variables, such as the vehicle dimensions, their state uncertainty can
be reduced progressively by means of repeated measurements. The estimated value based
on the available measurements converges with the true values, as long as there is no
systematic sensor error, e.g. in the form of an offset. For the estimation of dynamic,
time-changeable states such as the object position or the object speed, due to the move-
ment of the object between the measuring times, there is no convergence with a true value.
Therefore, for the evaluation of the quality of the state estimation, it is stipulated that the
mean error is zero and the uncertainty as low as possible.
20
Predicting of Machine Perception for Automated Driving
413
The basic procedure for handling state uncertainties is the general Bayes ﬁlter [9]. With
this, the estimated state of an object and the related uncertainty are represented by a
multi-dimensional probability density function p (PDF):
pk þ 1 xk þ 1jZ1:k þ 1
ð
Þ:
In general, it depends on all the measurements Z1:k þ 1 ¼ fz1; . . .; zk þ 1g available at
time k + 1. This is expressed by means of the selected notation of a conditional proba-
bility, i.e. the probability for the state of system x is conditional upon measurements Z.
The motion model of an object captured by the sensors for the period between two
consecutive measurements is described by a motion equation of the form
xk þ 1jk ¼ f xk
ð
Þ þ vk
whereby vk represents an additive disturbance variable representing possible model errors.
The motion equation expresses in which state, such as location, speed and direction of
motion, the object will probably ﬁnd itself at the next point in time. Alternatively, this
motion equation can also be expressed by means of a Markov transition probability
density:
fk þ 1jkðxk þ 1jxkÞ:
The Markov transition probability density is ultimately only another mathematical
notation for the same model assumptions. To keep the equations practically calculable, it
is common to presuppose a Markov property of the ﬁrst order. This property expresses
simplistically that the future state of a system only depends on the last known state and the
current measurement, not on the entire history of measurements and states. Therefore, the
Markov property of the ﬁrst order is a presupposed system property. In our speciﬁc case,
the predicted state xk+1 of the object before the new measurement is available only
depends on the last determined state xk, as this implicitly comprises the entire measure-
ment history Z1:k ¼ fz1; . . .; zkg:
The prediction of the current object state xk to the next measuring time k + 1 is
basically carried out based on the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation
pk þ 1jk xk þ 1jxk
ð
Þ ¼
Z
fk þ 1jk xk þ 1jxk
ð
Þpk xk
ð
Þdxk:
This is denoted as a prediction step of the Bayes ﬁlter.
The measuring process of the sensors can generally be described as a measurement
equation in the form
zk þ 1jk ¼ hk þ 1 xk þ 1
ð
Þ þ wk þ 1
414
K. Dietmayer
The measurement function hðÞ describes how measurements and state variables are
related. For example, if a state variable can be measured directly, then hðÞ is a 1:1
mapping. Here, the stochastic disturbance variable wk þ 1 represents a possible measuring
error. An alternative mathematical representation of the measurement equation is the
likelihood function
g zk þ 1jxk þ 1
ð
Þ:
If the current measurements zk þ 1 are available, the probability density function of the
object state is updated. The current estimate of the state is calculated using the Bayes
formula
pk þ 1 xk þ 1jzk þ 1
ð
Þ ¼

ð
Þ
R
g zk þ 1jxk þ 1
ð
Þpk þ 1jk xk þ 1jxk
ð
Þdx :
This second step to incorporate the current measurement is known as the innovation
step.
The recursive estimation procedure brieﬂy described by the prediction step and the
innovation step is known as the general Bayes ﬁlter, and all the methods and imple-
mentations of the stochastic state estimation commonly used today are based on this.
Along with the process and measurement equations, the procedure only requires an a
priori PDF for object state p0ðx0Þ at time k ¼ 0: However, it is not efﬁcient to implement
the ﬁlter in this general form.
With the assumption of normally distributed measurement signals and linear models, the
Kalman ﬁlter [13] enables a simple analytical implementation of the general Bayes ﬁlter.
As a Gaussian distribution is completely described by its ﬁrst two statistical moments, i.e.
the mean value and the related covariance matrix, the temporal ﬁltering of these two
moments represents a mathematically exact solution. The Kalman ﬁlter can be applied to
systems with non-linear process or measurement equations by using the Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) [11] or the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) [14]. While the EKF linearizes the
system equations by using a Taylor series approximation, the objective of the UKF is a
stochastic approximation by using what are known as sigma points [14].
Independently of the speciﬁc implementation, all the procedures based on the general
Bayes ﬁlter have in common that they continuously supply a probabilistic measure for the
uncertainty of the physical variables determined from the sensor data. This enables the
reliable detection of sensor failures, but also of degeneration in the capabilities of indi-
vidual sensors. For example, if the measured data of individual sensors deviates signiﬁ-
cantly, i.e. outside the variation range to be expected statistically, there is a corresponding
reduction in capability.
20
Predicting of Machine Perception for Automated Driving
415
However, it must be remembered that a reduction in the capability of a sensor can only
be detected after it has occurred. Apart from trend indication in the case of slow
degeneration, it is not possible to make any prediction of the future perception capability
in relation to the state uncertainty.
20.3.3 Existence Uncertainty
For the performance of automated driving, existence uncertainty is at least as relevant as
state uncertainty. It expresses the probability that the object in the representation of the
vehicle’s surroundings actually corresponds to a real object. For example, emergency
braking of an automated vehicle should only be triggered in the case of a very high
existence probability for a detected obstacle.
While the estimation of state uncertainties using Bayes estimation methods is well
founded in theory, the existence probability in today’s systems is still mostly determined
on the basis of a heuristic quality measure. An object is taken as conﬁrmed if the quality
measure exceeds a sensor- and application-dependent threshold. For example, the quality
measures are based on the number of measurements that have conﬁrmed the object, or
simply the interval between the initialization of the object and the current point in time.
Often the state uncertainty of the object (Sect. 20.3.2) is also used for the validation.
An approach with a better theoretical foundation is the estimation of a probability-based
existence probability. This ﬁrstly requires a deﬁnition of the speciﬁc object existence. While
in some applications, all real objects are taken to be existent, the object existence can also be
limited to the objects that are relevant in the current application. Additionally, a limitation to
the objects that can also be detected with the current sensor setup is also possible. In contrast
to a threshold procedure, this determination of the existence probability enables a
probability-based interpretation option. For example, an existence probability of 90 %
means that there is a 90 % probability that the measurement history and the motion pattern of
the object were created by a real object. Consequently, the action planning of the automated
vehicle can use these probabilities when evaluating alternative actions.
A known algorithm for calculating an existence probability is the Joint Integrated
Probabilistic Data Association (JIPDA) procedure, also based on the Bayes ﬁlter, which
was ﬁrst introduced in 2004 by Musicki and Evans [15]. This procedure additionally uses
the detection and false alarm probabilities of the sensors, which are presumed to be
known.
The calculation of the current object existence probability is performed similarly to
state estimation in the Kalman ﬁlter in a prediction step and an innovation step. The
existence prediction is performed using a Markov model of the ﬁrst order. The predicted
existence of an object is given by the Markov chain
pk þ 1jk 9x
ð
Þ ¼ pSpk 9x
ð
Þ þ pBpkð69xÞ
416
K. Dietmayer
whereby the probability ps represents the persistence probability of the object and pB the
probability for the occurrence of an object in the sensor capture area. Consequently, the
probability for the disappearance of an object is given by 1  pS: In the innovation step,
the a posteriori existence probability pk þ 1ð9xÞ is calculated. It essentially depends on the
number of current measurements that conﬁrm the existence of the object.
As the persistence probability of an object depends on the current object state and the
posteriori existence probability in turn depends on the data associations, the JIPDA ﬁlter
can be interpreted as the coupling of two Markov chains shown in Fig. 20.4. The upper
Markov chain represents the state prediction and innovation known from the Kalman ﬁlter,
while the lower Markov chain represents the prediction and innovation of the existence
probability. For details on the JIPDA procedure and its speciﬁc formulation with regard to
the applications in automotive applications, see [16] for example. Current multi-object
tracking procedures only developed in the last few years also enable integrated
object-speciﬁc existence estimation. For further information on this, see [9, 17, 18, 19–21].
With regard to the functional behavior of the existence estimation, the same limitations
apply as with the state estimation. A probabilistic measure for the speciﬁc existence of the
object is continuously supplied. Therefore, sensor failures during operation can also be
detected reliably in this uncertainty domain. However, a prediction of future capability is
not possible here either.

20.3.4 Class Uncertainty
Classiﬁcation procedures for determining the object class, i.e. the determination of
semantic information, are structured very sensor-speciﬁcally. Due to the signiﬁcantly
higher information content, image-based procedures are more common in the classiﬁca-
tion sector. A differentiation is made for learning procedures in which the classiﬁer trains
ofﬂine using positive and negative examples and then can recognize the trained object
classes to a greater or lesser extent during online operation. The characteristics used in the
training are either speciﬁed or are implicitly generated themselves in the learning process.
Methodically, two basic approaches have established themselves in the learning proce-
dures. On the one hand there are cascaded procedures based on Viola and Jones [22] or
methods based on different neuronal networks [23, 24].
A more classical but also common approach is to specify from the sensor data as many
deterministic characteristics as possible for the different classes, such as length, width or
speed, and to determine for these the class-speciﬁc statistical variation areas. The mean
value of the individual characteristics, including the variation range, is approximated by
means of a normal distribution, for example. Following this, based on the current mea-
sured values and the known characteristic distributions, the most probable class from a
Bayesian perspective is determined. If different sensors are to be used in combination

the
Dempster-Shafer theory [12] can be used for the class determination, because it allows
“non-knowledge” to be considered as well. However, these procedures are generally less
powerful than learning procedures, and will presumably continue to diminish in impor-
tance as a result.
A disadvantage of all the classiﬁcation procedures named is that no theoretically
substantiated probabilities can be determined for the current quality of the classiﬁcation.
At present no comprehensive theoretical basis exists for this. The output of the classiﬁers
is currently only an individual reliability measure that can be standardized to the value
range of 0–1. It does not represent a probability in the narrower sense, and therefore
different algorithms are not comparable in this regard. Image-based trained classiﬁers
differ so greatly from characteristic-based procedures comprising lidar and radar sensors
that standardized treatment of them will not be easy to achieve.
20.3.5 Summary
The explanation in the previous sections make clear that the machine perception is made
up of three fundamental uncertainty domains, namely the state uncertainty, the existence
uncertainty and the class uncertainty. All domains have a direct inﬂuence on the capability
of the machine perception. If the uncertainties are too great, whereby it must be deﬁned
which uncertainties are tolerable for speciﬁc functions, it is no longer possible to drive an
automated vehicle reliably.
418
K. Dietmayer
What is problematic is that a future higher uncertainty, and thus a greater error
probability, cannot be predicted in time. While the currently known methods for esti-
mating state and existence uncertainties do enable a current estimation of the capability of
the machine perception, in principle it is not possible to predict degeneration in the
capability of individual sensors or even a failure of components. Only a trend indication is
possible. Table 20.1 summarizes the results once more.
20.4
Implications for the Machine Perception Capability
Prediction
As was explained and substantiated in the previous sections, the future development of the
machine perception capability of an automated vehicle cannot be predicted with sufﬁcient
conﬁdence. By no means can the perception capability for the period of 5–10 s required to
transfer the driving duties to a human be reliably predicted under all circumstances, as is
stipulated as a backup option in highly-automated driving. Moreover, a fully-automated
vehicle would have to be able to achieve an intrinsically safe state autonomously, for
which even a longer period of time would be required in some cases than for the case of a
driver taking over. Although there are certainly a number of options for predicting the
future limitation of the perception capability based on external conditions such as

imminent camera glare due to the low position of the sun and sensor limitation due to the
onset of rain, snow or fog banks, these are special scenarios that also require extremely
reliable context information. Therefore, in principle, the prediction of the perception
capability is not a general option for ensuring the necessary reliability for automated
driving.
However, as described above, there already exist theoretically substantiated methods
and procedures for continually monitoring the current machine perception capability and
being able to detect system failures and the degradation of individual components reliably
and quickly. Therefore, machine perception systems must be designed in such a way that
sensor redundancy is provided which ensures that sufﬁcient perception capability remains
either until the transfer to the driver or, in the case of a fully-automated vehicle, until an
intrinsically safe state is achieved if individual components break down. Thus, a complete
failure of the machine perception must not occur.
Redundancies such as these are basically provided by multi-sensor systems that are
used in parallel and combine information from various sensors and sensor principles. For
example, if radar and lidar sensors are incorporated, they both supply distance mea-
surement data, but of different quality and in a different sensor capture area. The weather
dependencies of the sensor principles are also different. However, due to the similarity of
the measured data, they can provide mutual support or also mutual compensation if a
component breaks down, with a slight loss of measuring quality for the overall system.
Additionally, only through this usage of independent sensor principles is it possible to
achieve the highest safety level in accordance with ASIL D, which is required for the
operational safety in automated driving.
A redundancy can also be planned and provided easily for cameras. For example, if a
camera in a stereo camera system breaks down, the second camera of the stereo system
remains available for the classiﬁcation tasks and the detection of road markings. Only a
distance estimate is then no longer available from stereo data and would have to be
compensated be means of lidar or radar sensors, for example. Of course, a prerequisite for
this redundancy is that the processing hardware and the underlying software of the
individual cameras would have to be set up independently, i.e. redundantly. Alternatively,
an additional mono camera could be incorporated, including its own processing hardware
and software. Therefore, redundancy concepts such as these can enable a minimum
perception capability to be always maintained in the automated vehicle, even if individual
components break down.
Automated vehicle control is based on the current machine perception and on the
prediction of the current trafﬁc situation. With the state of the technology, the latter is
essentially performed by means of a simple prediction of the current motion behavior of
the objects into the future. Due to the large number of possible and non-predictable events,
especially the reactive actions of other road users, the uncertainties increase so starkly
after around 2–3 s that reliable trajectory planning is no longer possible on this basis.
Therefore, the situation prediction cannot reliably bridge the period for transferring the
vehicle control back to the driver in highly-automated driving, or for achieving an
420
K. Dietmayer
intrinsically safe state in fully-automated driving, if the machine perception no longer
continuously updates the vehicle environment model.
However, due to his/her driving experience, a human is also only capable of anticipating
the overall situation for around 2–3 s into the future with a degree of reliability [25]. But,
because a human perceives and interprets his/her environment quasi-continuously, this
brief prediction horizon is completely sufﬁcient for reacting adequately and de-escalatory
in practically all situations, and for avoiding accidents as a general rule. This should also be
possible for automated vehicles, whereby here of course additional latencies and uncer-
tainties in the perception must be considered. The prerequisite, as mentioned above, is a
guaranteed minimum capability for the machine perception.
However, for the overall operation, it is essential that the automated vehicle does not
put itself into a technically insolvable situation in the ﬁrst place. The permissible criticality
of the situation must always correspond to the current machine perception capability.
What must be considered in particular here are suddenly occurring failures and the
resulting spontaneous reduction in the machine perception capability. Within the relatively
reliable prediction period for the situation development of 2–3 s, the automated vehicle
must be able to adjust its driving behavior to the altered machine perception capability.
A simple example would be driving on its own lane. If the sensor range is reduced by
technical failures or weather factors, the vehicle must be able to adjust its speed to the
current situation within the validity of the prediction, and this represents a reliably
solvable technical problem.
While this simple situation is easy to describe and analyze, at present it is generally not
known how critical situations arise, and what distinguishes these in terms of the capability
of an automated vehicle. In any case, in establishing the reliability of automated vehicles,
driving a predeﬁned number of kilometers does not ensure that the resulting dataset
contains all the possible critical situation developments (episodes). Consequently, it is not
possible to ensure the operating reliability in this way, regardless of the fact the mileage
required to statistically prove the very low error rates would be neither practically nor
economically feasible.
Therefore, a possible research task in the future would be to ﬁnd a suitable mathe-
matical representation of random episodes that would then provide the range of all pos-
sible episodes. Based on this description, what are known as Monte Carlo simulations, for
example, can be used to structure the entire episode range into critical and uncritical
subareas, in order to draw a conclusion about required speciﬁc tests. A possible
methodical approach for this would be rejection sampling, whereby every sample rep-
resents a complete episode. Starting from basic episodes, which are distinguished by
different road types (1, 2, or 3 lanes per direction, oncoming trafﬁc), for example, or by the
number of vehicles in the near vicinity, similar situations are generated through the
statistical variation of the episode parameters. When there are a sufﬁcient number of
samples, it is to be expected that the episode range has been completely covered. In the
process, every episode used is tested for its physical feasibility, and irrelevant episodes are
discarded. The remaining episodes are then tested as to whether, for example, critical time
20
Predicting of Machine Perception for Automated Driving
421
gaps or spaces arise between objects. The suitable criteria for this must also be deﬁned.
The identiﬁcation and prioritizing of critical situations are carried out by means of sub-
sequent clustering in the episode range.
The goal of such a procedure would be to use this hierarchical approach to determine a
quantity of potentially critical episodes that is as complete as possible but still manage-
able. This would then be analyzed using simulated data as to its controllability by the
highly-automated system at different levels of machine perception capability. For exam-
ple, individual ranges, capture angles and detection rates could be modeled for a sensor
setup in the vehicle in order to then systematically analyze the consequences for the
behavior of the vehicle for critical episodes. This analysis can be carried out initially for a
fully-functioning system, and then under the assumption of a failure of individual
components.
Another research question that is open is the possibility of a more reliable situation
prediction that would use context information and hypotheses about the future behavior of
the road users to enable longer prediction periods. Such a procedure would be justiﬁed to
the extent that our entire trafﬁc system is based on the cooperation of the road users. Of
course, a disadvantage of this would be that uncooperative behavior, or simply the errors
of other road users, could not be expected nor included in the action planning of an
automated vehicle. In this respect, such approaches do not enable a signiﬁcant extension
of the reliably predicted time period, but they can still support planning algorithms.
Additionally, it should be noted that in many situations manual drivers do not have a
chance to react appropriately when other drivers do not behave correctly or make
unforeseen driving errors. Therefore, excessive demands should not be made of automated
vehicles in this regard. However, naturally this is also a question of society’s consensus
with respect to the permissible potential risk involved in a new technology.
20.5
Summary
The existing methods for the state and existence estimations are based on a closed,
well-founded theory and enable in-line, reliable evaluation of the current quality of the
machine perception capability. This makes it possible to detect complete failures of
individual sensors as well as a gradual degeneration in the sensor technology and/or
perception.
However, the procedures do not enable a prediction of the future perception capability,
and only a linear extrapolation of detected trends is conceivable. The reliability and quality
of the evaluation of the machine perception capability depends on the available sensor
models, and error models in particular, which are sensor- and manufacturer-speciﬁc. The
perception systems alone do not have a sufﬁcient prediction capability that could reliably
cover a time horizon of between 5 and 10 s, as is currently envisaged for returning the
highly-automated system to the driver. However, this is probably not even necessary for the
reliable behavior of an automated vehicle. What is decisive for the controllability of
422
K. Dietmayer
situations during automated driving is a sufﬁcient number of physically implementable and
reliable trajectories for the automated vehicle. These are essentially deﬁned by the spatial
proximity of limiting objects to one’s vehicle and the available drivable free space.
Therefore spatial proximity must be incorporated into key ﬁgures for evaluating criticality,
while also taking into account uncertainties in the perception and the number of physically
possible, reliable trajectories. The currently available machine perception capability must
also be considered here. Such sufﬁciently coordinated and theoretically founded criticality
measures do not exist at present.
A situation prediction into the future over a period of 2–3 s will not provide a con-
clusive result in purely model-based, probabilistic extrapolation, as every development of
the situation becomes possible after this period. A possible approach, and a future research
question, would be the context-related, hypothesis-based temporal extrapolation based of
known and evaluated situations stored in a knowledge base. With an existing knowledge
base, the current situation can then be evaluated continuously with regard to the assumed
outcome. No reliable methods exist for this at present, and in some cases not even any
ideas of how it could be implemented. However, this seems to be a path which can be
taken.
The advances in situation prediction are extremely difﬁcult to foresee. However, sig-
niﬁcantly more capable methods can presumably be expected only in a time horizon of
10 years or more.

The Release of Autonomous Vehicles

21.1
Introduction
In the future, the functions of autonomous driving could fundamentally change all road
trafﬁc; to do so, it would have to be implemented on a large scale, in series production. In
general, a technical system such as a car needs to be released for it to make the transition
from the development phase to mass production [1]. According to the principles of project
management, production release is only granted when the previously deﬁned requirements
have been fulﬁlled by this technical system. These requirements come from a wide range
of sources, such as customers, standards or legislation. Various areas are addressed by the
requirements: these include the requirements for the safety of the technical system for type
approval1 and product liability2 reasons.
The safety of people in public road trafﬁc is one of the oft-quoted motivations for
vehicle automation, because the vast majority of present-day accidents are caused by
human drivers. Based on this motivation is the requirement that substituting humans does

1According to Directive 2007/46/EG [2], the expression “(…) ‘type approval’ describes the
procedure whereby one Member State certiﬁes that a type of a vehicle (…) satisﬁes the relevant
administrative provisions and technical requirements”.
2Reuter [3] states: “(Tortious) product liability serves to protect any person (product users as well as
uninvolved third parties) from unsafe products. Product liability regulates the compensation of
damage to health or property that has been caused by a product defect”.

not reduce the safety of public road trafﬁc. This should apply to both passengers and the
entire trafﬁc system in which the autonomous vehicle is in motion. What this requirement
means, and whether it would actually be fulﬁlled upon the introduction of the autonomous
vehicle, is the focus of the following discussion.
A starting point is provided by Gasser et al. [4]: The report from the German Federal
Highway Research Institute considers the development of accident numbers upon the
introduction of vehicle automation. Starting from the total number of accidents for con-
ventional driving (see Fig. 21.1, blue and green ﬁeld) it is assumed that accidents (green
ﬁeld) are avoided by means of vehicle automation. However, new accidents could also be
caused by the risks of automation (yellow ﬁeld).
This representation does not differentiate in terms of the severity of the accident, but
the severity of the accident is also relevant when considering the impact on safety. Safety
is generally described as the absence of unreasonable risks. This risk is deﬁned as a
product of the probability of an accident and the severity of that accident.
Figure 21.2 illustrates in a qualitative way this theoretical risk avoidance potential
depending on the severity of the accident. Here Fig. 21.2 adheres to the ﬁndings of
Heinrich [5] and Hydén [6] that accidents of decreasing severity occur in larger numbers.
The scale of the related severity of the accident is ordinal, meaning that there is clearly an
order between the different degrees of severity: For example, a fatality is weighted as
graver than a serious injury. However, academics are divided on the relative weighting of
these different degrees. While degrees of severity are compared in terms of costs, this is
contentious and will not be discussed further in this work.

W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
Considering the severity and the number of accidents shows that while risks are
removed (Fig. 21.2 green area), there are risks remaining (Fig. 21.2 blue area) which are
not addressed by vehicle automation. In addition, new risks are created by the substitution
of humans and the automated execution of the driving. The human is no longer available
as a backup in the case of a failure or a defect. The yellow area in Fig. 21.2 illustrates this
additional risk. It is uncertain here whether the removal of risks and the creation of
additional risks is uniform across the degrees of severity. It is possible that there is a
greater reduction in serious accidents but an increase in less serious accidents. Figure 21.2
illustrates this idea via the deformation of the assumed triangle.
For the approval of fully-automated driving, this means that not only a reduction in the
number of accidents must be proven, but rather an accepted ratio Vacc between avoided
Ravo and additionally caused risks Radd.
Vacc ¼ Radd
Ravo
Contrary to many assertions, it has not yet been proven that a ratio of less than 1 is
actually necessary for the approval. Will autonomous vehicles actually increase trafﬁc
safety? If the ratio were greater than 1, the system would reduce trafﬁc safety. Examples
exist today whereby corresponding added beneﬁts create acceptance for additional risks:
For example, for many motorcyclists the experience of freedom, driving pleasure, etc.,
balances out the considerable additional risk compared to other means of transport. In
addition the apportionment of beneﬁts and risks facilitates the acceptance of motorcycling.
The added beneﬁts and the additional risk mainly affect the person on the motorcycle. The
risk for other road users created by a motorcycle lies between the risks created by a bicycle
and a car, and therefore motorcycling is acceptable without added beneﬁts for other road
users.
In this document, no speciﬁc value is determined for the acceptable ratio for autono-
mous driving, because this value is the result of a complex discussion among those who
would be affected by autonomous driving. This value varies depending on various factors
such as societal, political and economic differences. A vivid example of this is the
acceptance of the use of nuclear energy in Germany, the USA or Japan in the last years:
On the one hand, the accepted ratio varies considerably between the countries, and on the
other, this changes over time, so that for example in Germany in 2012, a nuclear phase-out
was decided on.
The central component of this document is the evaluation of autonomous driving, i.e.
the study of the methods that are to enable safety assessment of autonomous vehicles.
Even though a large number of papers describe the potential of autonomous driving in
theory, the authors are not aware of any document that has conducted this evaluation. In
order to show why this is so, we will ﬁrst describe the current release concepts in the
automobile industry, and then show what the requirements are for test concepts. In the

third section, we describe the special features of autonomous driving in relation to current
systems. On the basis of this, the fourth section looks at the special challenge for the
production release of autonomous vehicles. The approaches that address this challenge are
discussed, and then a conclusion on the production release of autonomous vehicles is
drawn in the ﬁnal section.
21.2
Current Test Concepts in the Automobile Industry
The safety validation concepts currently used in the automobile industry are for obtaining
approval for four distinct automation levels. To illustrate the difference for the test of these
systems compared to autonomous driving, these four systems will be explained brieﬂy.
The ﬁrst system in series is the driver-only vehicle without the automation of the driving
task. For these systems, it can be seen that, on the one hand, the components used do not
exceed maximum failure rates, and on the other, that the driver is able to maneuver the
vehicle reliably in road trafﬁc (controllability). Here the abilities of the driver are relied on, as
the results of the conducted tests with test drivers are transferred to future users in the
subsequent area of use. Over the last decades, this has shown itself to be successful in serving
as proof of safety. Despite the increasing number of kilometers driven in road trafﬁc, the
number of accidents remains constant, and the number of fatalities has even fallen.
The second level of automation in series is the assisting system: For systems such as
Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), their functions have to be
covered by the test in addition to the existing scope of testing. The option of a take-over
by the driver and controllability must be provided in systems that actively support the
driving task, increase comfort, and reduce the burden on the driver. The Code of Practice
[7] thus assumes that, in this Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), responsibility
for vehicle behavior remains with the human driver. For these systems it also applies that
the abilities of the driver are relied on, so that the results of the conducted tests with test
drivers are transferred to future users in the subsequent area of use.
The ﬁrst partly-automated systems have also been approved for use in series cars:
Depending on the speed, ACC in combination with LKA takes over the lateral and
longitudinal control for the driver. According to the deﬁnition, in the third category of
systems, the driver is also responsible for the vehicle behavior. Therefore, this test also
focuses on the possibility for the take-over and the controllability by the driver; and so the
same principle applies as with the assisting system, which relies on the abilities of the
vehicle driver to correct undesired automation behavior. This level of automation presents
the special challenge for the safety validation that results from the conﬂict between
relieving the driver and the necessary situation awareness of the supervisor of the lateral
and longitudinal control. However, here too the driver is ultimately responsible.
Of particular interest for the test are emergency intervening systems, which automat-
ically intervene in the vehicle control and thus in the vehicle dynamics. The goal of this
fourth category of systems is to counter the driver’s loss of control over the situation. For
428
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
example, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Emergency Brake Assist (EBA) are
components of mechatronic brake systems that apply additional or reduced braking force
without any action on the part of the driver, thus actively intervening in the vehicle
dynamics. This is performed during the driver’s loss of control, when the vehicle, in
combination with the driver, is at a higher level of risk. ESC is designed in such a way that
an intervention is carried out when the driver clearly no longer has control over the vehicle
in the current situation (e.g. in the case of extreme over- or understeering). In contrast, the
EBA becomes active when the reaction time and the braking distance before a rear-end
collision are no longer sufﬁcient for a human to prevent this accident. The goal of
validating the system regarding safety requirements is to show that emergency intervening
systems should only become active (true-positive) when the loss of control becomes
obvious and thus there is a severely increased risk. For this, it must be shown that the
false-positive rate becomes as small as possible and/or the effects can be controlled by the
driver; the false-positive and false-negative rates of the EBA mainly depend on the object
detection. Figure 21.3 shows a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC curve),
which describes this relationship for the object detection.
As these emergency intervening systems are systems with no guaranteed operation, an
increase in safety can be achieved by reduced usage combined with a smaller
false-positive rate. Additionally, these systems enable overriding. ESC and EBA employ
the selective braking of wheels to intervene mainly in the braking system, and various
strategies can be used to override them, by steering and/or accelerating.
As has been shown, the main focus in the development of the four system levels is
controllability by the driver. The goal is either to enable controllability for the driver or to
restore it for him/her (design for controllability). Therefore, the driver as a backup is the
basis for validating current vehicles regarding safety and hence also for the production
release.
The development and veriﬁcation of this controllability for the driver is generally
carried out in accordance with the procedure model in Fig. 21.4. This procedure based on
the V-Model differentiates between the downward branch on the left—development and
Fig.

design—and the upward branch on the right—veriﬁcation and validation—as a means of
quality assurance. A test concept is followed for the quality assurance.
As shown by Schuldt et al. [10] in Fig. 21.5, a test concept comprises the analysis of
the test object (object under test—OUT), the test case generation, the test execution and
the test evaluation.
The analysis of the test object and the test case generation should be performed during
the development/design phase, so that the test cases to be carried out are already deﬁned
for the veriﬁcation and validation (see Fig. 21.4 procedure model). According to
Horstmann [11] and Weitzel [9], at present a distinction is made between three methods
for the determination of test cases: One method is the test speciﬁcation based on the
speciﬁcation sheet, whereby test cases are deﬁned based on system speciﬁcations, which
have been set down in speciﬁcation sheets. The second method is the risk-based test
speciﬁcation, whereby risk considerations are used to determine the test cases. The third
method is the interface-based test speciﬁcation, whereby the test cases are selected in
Fig. 21.4 Safety evaluation methods in the development process (according to [9]). Image rights:

order to cover the value ranges of the interfaces. For all these methods, the driver-vehicle
system is the basis of the test case determination.
To start with the quality assurance as early as possible, tests are already carried out in
virtual test environments before the ﬁrst test vehicles are ready for testing. The test
execution by means of model- and software-in-the-loop tests works based on simulation
models of the vehicle, the human and the environment. The test cases previously identiﬁed
are used here. The further the development progresses, the greater the number of real
components available for testing. Test benches, driving simulators or testing grounds are
used in these tests. The tests performed using hardware-in-the-loop, driver-in-the-loop or
vehicle-in-the-loop provide information about the quality of the components and functions
being tested. To check the actions and reactions of the driver-vehicle-environment system
(to close the loop), simulation models are also needed in performing these tests. Therefore,
simulation models will be required continuously for the test execution up to this devel-
opment point in order to test the entire vehicle. Simulation models are mappings of reality
in software and have per se the property of simplifying the real world.
As a result of this fact, there currently exists no safety-relevant function in a series
vehicle that has not also been tested with real test vehicles. Thus, for testing current
systems, the automotive industry always falls back on real vehicles, real humans and a real
environment.
A result of the necessary use of real driving is, for example, that before the production
release of the Mercedes Benz E-Class (W212), a total of 36 million test kilometers were
completed [12].3 According to Fach et al. [13], the safety validation of a current driver
assistance system alone requires up to 2 million test kilometers. After 50,000 to
100,000 km were covered in these test drives between two interventions of the ﬁrst level
of the EBA, this high number of test kilometers becomes understandable. This does not
even consider the fact that the more critical second level of the EBA was not triggered
during these test kilometers (compare assertion in Fig. 21.3). This eight-ﬁgure total of test
kilometers is accompanied by considerable costs for the vehicle prototypes, test drivers,
test execution and the evaluation of same. While the time requirement can be reduced by
means of parallel testing with multiple vehicles, additional costs are incurred for the
vehicle prototypes.
This example shows that even for current driver assistance systems, validating safety
based on real driving in road trafﬁc represents an economic challenge for the OEM
(Original Equipment Manufacturer). This challenge grows further against the background
of the increasing number of functions and widening ranges of variants and versions for
each vehicle model. For example, Burgdorf [14], deduces a number of 160 · 270 variants
for the BMW 318i (E90) with components such as body form, engine, transmission, drive,
color, A/C, infotainment.
3“(…) The [E-Class] arrived by way of comprehensive virtual tests with digital prototypes and a
total of 36 million test kilometers (…).” (Retrieved 28/07/2014).
21
The Release of Autonomous Vehicles
431
Therefore, there are already endeavors to use other test execution tools alongside real
driving for ﬁnal safety validation. The only example of this known to the authors is the
homologation of ESC systems. According to ECE Regulation 13H for the EU [15], there
is the option to perform some of these tests in the simulation:
When a vehicle has been tested physically in accordance with section 4, the compliance of
other versions or variants of the same vehicle type can be proven by means of computer
simulations that adhere to the test conditions of section 4 and the test procedures of
section 5.9.
Note that this only applies to the ESC system. As an example, Baake et al. [16]
describe the homologation of ESC systems for vans from Mercedes-Benz in collaboration
with Bosch and IPG CarMaker: Using what are known as master cars, a vehicle model
was created in CarMaker, and these master cars were used to collect reference data on the
basis of which the simulation model was validated. This enabled the simulation-based
recommendation for the approval of further vehicle variants with different settings. Baake
et al. also report on the transfer of this procedure to the Cross Wind Assist
(CWA) function, although this has not yet been done.
21.3
Requirements for a Test Concept
In order to discuss in the following section why full automation poses a particular chal-
lenge for safety validation, we will ﬁrst describe the requirements for test concepts to
assess safety. These are divided into effectiveness and efﬁciency criteria.
21.3.1 Effectiveness Criteria
Representative—valid
The requirement for representativeness has two aspects: On the one hand, the test case
generation must ensure that the test coverage required is achieved. For example, a vehicle
should not only be tested at 20 °C and sunshine, as it will be exposed to snow, rain and
temperatures under 0 °C in real situations. Additionally, vehicle limit samples (tolerances
during production) should be considered in the test case generation. On the other hand, the
test execution must encompass the minimum degree of reality required. This means that
the simpliﬁcation in the representation of reality must not inﬂuence the behavior of the
OUT nor the behavior and properties of the environment with respect to real behavior.
Variable
The test execution must provide the option to implement all the test cases deﬁned by the
test case generation.
432
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
Observable
For the test evaluation in particular, it is necessary to observe parameters of the test
execution. Only when the situation can also be described it is possible to make the
statement test “passed” or “not passed”.
21.3.2 Efficiency Criteria
Economical
There are two parts to the requirement for the economical test concept: On the one hand,
the test execution should be prepared and carried out as quickly as possible in order to be
able to provide the persons involved in the development with feedback on the test object
immediately. On the other hand, it must be ensured that the test execution is prepared and
carried out at the lowest cost possible.
Reproducible
Reproducibility greatly reduces the work required for regression tests. For example, if an
error has been detected and the test object modiﬁed accordingly, the goal is to subject the
OUT to a test in the same scenario as before.
In good time
The earlier in the development process that a product can be tested informatively, the
fewer the development steps that need to be repeated in the case of an error.
Safe
The test execution should not exceed the accepted risk for all participants. This must be
considered in particular for real driving, whereby road users are participating in the test
without their knowledge.
The requirements described are fulﬁlled sufﬁciently by the current test concepts, and
therefore the four different automation levels presented are approved. However, the recalls
of all the OEMs, which affect millions of vehicles, indicate that these test concepts
certainly do not address everything. Are these concepts also suitable for validating the
safety of new systems such as autonomous driving for public road trafﬁc? Nothing
changes about the requirements presented. However, as will be described in the following
section, the OUT changes greatly.
21

433
21.4
Special Features of Autonomous Driving
In the following section, the difference between fully-automated driving and current
driving in road trafﬁc is explained. After this, the differences between the trafﬁc systems
for air travel, rail travel and road trafﬁc are present in compact form, so that only limited
ﬁndings from these areas can be transferred.
21.4.1 Comparison Between Current Automation and Full
Automation of Road Vehicles
For the previously described safety validation of the four levels of automation available in
series, the focus was on the vehicle, and in particular on its controllability by the driver. In
the combined representation of the three-level model for human target-oriented behavior
based on Rasmussen [17] and the three-level hierarchy of the driving task based on
Donges [18] in Fig. 21.6, this validation corresponds to the elements with the green
background. The vehicle and its behavior in the longitudinal and lateral directions are
tested; in the process, the behavior or abilities of the future driver are not tested, but only
the possibilities for the test driver to control the vehicle in the test cases by means of
steering and acceleration control. Therefore, the green box only overlaps slightly with the
area that stands for the driver.
For full automation, the abilities of the driver are now omitted and he/she also no
longer functions as a backup. The driving task, i.e. navigation, guidance and
stabilization/control, is taken over by the driving robot. This means that for autonomous

driving, there is no test of the controllability, but only a test of the operation of a technical
system. On the one hand, this makes the test easier, because the uncertainties due to the
human and its individual differences no longer need to be covered by the test. On the other
hand, there is no longer the option to use test cases and test drivers to draw conclusions
about other use cases. The human, who generally acts based on skills, rules and knowl-
edge, is omitted.
For the safety validation of current systems, safety must be proven that results from the
driver and the vehicle in combination; however, for the production release of the vehicle,
at present the focus is solely on the vehicle. Additionally assumed, but not tested, is the
“reliability” of the driver. In assessing the autonomous system in terms of safety, the
safety now results exclusively from the technical system of the driving robot and the
vehicle (yellow ﬁeld of Fig. 21.6), which must be proven.
Figure 21.6 shows on the one hand that here the quantity of tasks that must be tested
increases: The driving robot is required for a wide variety of application areas (see Use
Cases Chap. 2) such as navigation, guidance, stabilization/control. This task quantity
presents a particular challenge in public spaces without access limitations. On the other
hand, the task quality of the technical system changes. Current systems are merely
executive or are continuously monitored by a human, while for the autonomous system
the execution of a task must fulﬁll the requirements of the safety discussed at the
beginning of this document.
21.4.2 Comparison of the Stipulations in Air Travel, Road Traffic
and Rail Travel
Along with road trafﬁc, there are other trafﬁc systems in which automation has established
itself. However, the following section will discuss the extent to which the challenges and
solutions from these areas are transferable to vehicle automation.
The automation in (civilian) air travel does not currently provide any examples of full
automation. Even if pilots only very rarely actually perform ﬂying tasks, they are still
present in a supervising and operating capacity. Table 21.1 provides an overview of the
differences in the trafﬁc systems, which was taken from Weitzel et al. [9] and Ständer [19].
For the safety validation, the safety concept for the trafﬁc ﬂow is of particular interest
here, as this shows the differences between air travel and road trafﬁc. Air travel operates in
a legally self-contained trafﬁc space, a collision warning system is mandatory, and
external monitoring of operations is provided by air trafﬁc control.
The railway trafﬁc system provides examples of full automation: For example, an
automated underground railway is in operation in Nuremberg. However, according to
Table 21.1, even in this trafﬁc system the safety concept for the trafﬁc ﬂow in particular
differentiates between road trafﬁc and the railway. There is a legally self-contained trafﬁc
space for rail travel; in addition, logic-based systems and external monitoring are used to
avoid a collision between two trains.

As a mixed operation, road trafﬁc does not fulﬁll the condition of a self-contained
trafﬁc space and external monitoring. The differences show why solutions for the pro-
duction release cannot be transferred directly to autonomous driving.
This comparison should not exclude the possibility that all solutions from air travel and
rail travel are of no interest for road trafﬁc. Certainly similar problems exist, such as the
reliability of safety-relevant components.
21.5
The Challenge of Releasing Fully-Automated Vehicles
for Production (the “Approval-Trap”)
As has been shown, the functions of autonomous driving as an OUT differ fundamentally
from current road vehicles, but also from means of transportation in air and rail travel.
Therefore, we now want to determine how meaningful the current test concepts presented
would be when transferred onto autonomous driving. We will also discuss what the effects
would be of continuing with the current test concept.
21.5.1 Validity of the Current Test Concept
for Autonomous Driving
It has already been explained that a test concept consists of test case generation and test
execution. Now we want to discuss how and whether both are transferable to autonomous
driving.
Test case generation
The three procedures for test case generation have already been explained brieﬂy in
Sect. 21.2; these procedures are based on the assumption of the driver’s driving capability.
The question of whether a random driver can control the test object is tied to the legally
stipulated driver’s license. According to the Road Trafﬁc Act (§ 2 Abs. 2 StVG), this
driver’s license is only issued if, among other things:
– the applicant has attained a minimum age,
– he/she is suitable for driving a motor vehicle,
– he/she has received training,
– and has passed theoretical and practical tests.
And according to § 2 Abs. 4 StVG, suitable is taken to mean:
A person is suitable for driving motor vehicles if he/she fulﬁlls the necessary physical and
mental requirements and has not substantially or repeatedly contravened trafﬁc regulations or
criminal laws.
On the basis of this required driving capability on the part of the driver, the test case
generation is limited to example situations: It is assumed that when the test driver has
21
The Release of Autonomous Vehicles
437
mastered these example situations, he/she and every other driver with a driver’s license
will also master the other relevant non-tested situations when driving. These include
situations in which the driver is actively driving, but also those situations in which the
driver is supervising the system and, if necessary, takes over control. Therefore, in
combination with the driver’s license test, these test cases provide a metric that allows a
conclusion to be drawn about the safety of the driver-vehicle system. The way in which it
would be possible to optimize the practical driver’s license test as an evaluation basis for
assessing the driving capability is discussed by Bahr [20].
In the absence of the driver, the currently accepted metric no longer applies, and
therefore the reduction of the test cases is no longer admissible. The test case generation
for autonomous driving must cover the driving capabilities in particular—a new quality of
functions—which the human previously brought to the driver-vehicle system. The theo-
retical and practical tests of the driver’s license test do not represent the difﬁculty here.
However, the following paragraphs—§ 10 Minimum Age, § 11 Suitability and § 12
Visual Faculty of the Driver’s License Regulation—present the challenge. Therefore,
these paragraphs stand implicitly for comprehensive requirements for the properties of the
humans who perform driving tasks. The human who fulﬁlls these requirements has
– experienced hundreds of thousands of kilometers as a road user,
– experienced social behavior as a member of society,
– learned cognitive abilities,
– trained sensomotor abilities,
– etc.
The authors are not currently aware of any method for validly testing these functions
for a technical system. Therefore, the accepted metric and the reduction of the test cases
no longer apply if the human is removed from the responsibility of performing the driving
task. The current test cases are not meaningful for releasing automated vehicles for
production, and therefore the test case generation must be adapted to the new system.
Test execution
As has already been shown, different methods ranging from HiL to SiL to real driving are
used for the test execution. At present, real driving is the most important method for the
approval; the reason for this, in particular, is the validity combined with the justiﬁable
economic overhead. However, along with the economic overhead, autonomous driving
also presents a systematic challenge for the known methods. At present, real driving
stands for driving in public road trafﬁc with test drivers. The task of the test driver is to
drive or supervise the vehicle in every situation in accordance with the task of the vehicle
user. Transferred to autonomous driving, the use of a test driver in the driver’s seat would
be non-real behavior of a user, as the user does not have to supervise the vehicle and the
environment anymore and intervene. Additionally, the vehicle could also participate in the
road trafﬁc without passengers (depending on the use case), and therefore a test driver
would represent a non-real component in the vehicle. As a result, there is a risk that the
438
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
use of a test driver could inﬂuence the other road users and alter their behavior. Further
reﬂections on this topic can be found in the Chap. 7.
Therefore, along with the test case generation, the current test execution is not directly
transferable to autonomous driving.
21.5.2 Millions of Kilometers on Public Roads Until the Production
Release of Fully-Automated Vehicles
The following theoretical consideration will show what it means to retain the current test
concept despite the differences shown. Let us assume that a reduction in the test cases is
not possible for autonomous driving, because no method exists, as with the driver’s
license test for humans. The objective is still to draw a conclusion as to whether the risk is
increased or not by the use of the autonomous vehicle:
Vacc ¼ Radd
Ravo
\1
Here we should note once again that this condition is in no way imperative. However,
for the theoretical consideration, a condition of less than 1 is assumed to be the worst case
scenario.
The only metric that the authors are aware of that can be used to determine such a
relationship are the ﬁgures from the subsequent evaluation of trafﬁc accidents. For Ger-
many, these are the ﬁgures from the Federal Statistical Ofﬁce. For example, for 2012 the
Federal Statistical Ofﬁce [21] cites 3375 fatal accidents recorded by the police in Ger-
many. The ﬁgure for fatalities is used because this represents the worst case scenario for
the veriﬁcation required. With a total of 709 billion km driven in Germany, this ﬁgure
represents an average of 210 million km between two fatal accidents. As these ﬁgures only
represent an expected value, shorter or longer distances also exist between two accidents.
To represent this distribution of the accident events, we use the Poisson distribution:
PkðkÞ ¼ kk
k! ek
Here it is assumed that the occurrence of an accident is an independent and
non-exhaustive random process PkðkÞ. In the equation, k corresponds to the number of
accident events and k to the expected value with which this event occurs. The expected
value k is deﬁned by the quotient
k ¼ stest
sperf
;
21
The Release of Autonomous Vehicles
439
whereby stest stands for the observed test kilometers and sleist for the performance of the
system. The performance stands for the expected number of kilometers between the
accidents. The probability distributions for k ¼ ½1 2 3 4 5 and k ¼ ½1 2 are shown in
Fig. 21.7 as an example.
The ﬁgure clearly illustrates the problem of providing veriﬁcation of a certain level of
risk: Let us assume that the blue distribution stands for an autonomous vehicle and the red
distribution for a driver-only vehicle. Both vehicles are driven the same number of test
kilometers stest ¼ as  s, with the distance factor as ¼ 2 and the average interval s between
two fatal accidents. The performance sperf ¼ aperf  s of the autonomous vehicle is greater
than that of the driver-only vehicle by the performance factor aperf ¼ 2. Consequently, for
the autonomous vehicle k ¼ 1, and for the driver-only vehicle k ¼ 2.
Even though the autonomous vehicle is characterized by double the performance of the
driver-only vehicle according to the previous assumption, during the test the autonomous
vehicle was involved in a fatal accident (probability P1ð1Þ ¼ 1  e1  0; 37), but not the
driver-only vehicle (probability P2ð0Þ ¼ 1  e2  0; 14). Therefore, a conclusion that the
autonomous vehicle is less safe than the driver-only vehicle must be called into question.
In any case, this example shows that a distance factor as greater than 2 is necessary to be
able to draw a conclusion with a sufﬁciently high signiﬁcance about the performance of
autonomous driving.
From a scientiﬁc point of view, for example, an error probability of 5 % must be
assumed, and therefore the same signiﬁcance level e ¼ 5 % must be used. A corre-
spondingly large distance factor as must be selected, depending on the number of acci-
dents, in order to have a probability of less than 5 % for a vehicle with a lower
performance to achieve this low number of accidents. Figure 21.8 shows the result of this
consideration and the numeric calculation of the values.

expected values. Image rights:

The data point at zero fatal accidents means that, with a distance factor of as  3, the
probability is less than 5 % that a worse vehicle than the comparison group is not involved
in a fatal accident.
Unfortunately, the probability of success for this test is just as small. Because if the test
vehicle is just as good as the comparison group, i.e. performance factor aperf ¼ 1 applies,
it follows that the probability of success for this veriﬁcation is also only 5 %. For the test
to be successful, a greater probability of success is desirable. As an example, a probability
of success of 50 % is now demanded; by which a test shows that the test vehicle is not
worse than the comparison group. For this, the test vehicle must perform better than the
test group. Figure 21.9 shows the result of this consideration.
The ﬁrst point expresses the following: If the test vehicle is approx. 4.3 times better
than the comparison group, the test is successful with a probability of 50 % that the test
vehicle with an error probability of 5 % is better than the comparison group.

The Release of Autonomous Vehicles
441
What this result now means for the test drive with the autonomous vehicle is
demonstrated by the distance of 210 million km between two fatal accidents. The last
point in Fig. 21.9 expresses the following: If the autonomous vehicle is approx. twice as
good ðaperf  2Þ as the comparison system (current vehicles), a test distance of at least
2.1 billion km must be driven ðstest ¼ as  210 Mio kmÞ. In this case, the veriﬁcation has
been achieved with 50 % probability, but ﬁve accidents would also occur with the same
probability.
Ironically, it follows from this consideration that the easier the vehicle driving is, the
greater the number of test kilometers that must be driven, as the comparison value is
correspondingly higher. For the interstate pilot, the current ﬁgures of the Federal Statis-
tical Ofﬁce indicate a comparison value of 662 million km between two fatal accidents.
Accordingly, 6.62 billion test kilometers must be driven on the interstate in order to
correspond to the presented conditions.
This theoretical excursion into statistics shows that production release can become a
challenge, if not an actual trap, for autonomous driving. Hereby, a number of factors for
determining the test kilometers have not been addressed yet; for example, a variation of
the system would mean that the test kilometers would have to be driven again, or the test
with and without passengers could use a factor of two in the calculation. The effect on the
determined necessary kilometers of different parameters not considered here such as area
of use, accident severity, accident cause and comparison vehicle, is derived in detail in
Winner [22].
These considerations are theoretical observations with freely made assumptions.
However, this approach is still suitable for illustrating the problems and challenges, and
for motivating the approaches that follow here.
21.6
Possible Approaches for Solving the Challenge of Testing
As has been shown, autonomous driving represents a new OUT which, due to its prop-
erties, calls the classic test concepts into question. New approaches are required to
overcome the testing challenge described: Accordingly, the next section will discuss why
reusing approved functions, and thus an evolutionary approach, seems necessary from the
perspective of safety validation. After this, we will discuss existing approaches that could
speed up testing.
21.6.1 Reusing Approved Functions
The ﬁrst and simplest possibility of obtaining the production release for a new system is in
reusing functions already released. If a system is used in the same way as before, a release
already issued can be taken over. However, if the scope of functions is expanded, this
must be treated again; the smaller the new area involved is, the less work is required.
442
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
Based on this argument, an evolution across all dimensions would seem to be a
possible approach for overcoming the testing challenge. Dimensions here refers, for
example, to the speed, the area of use but also the degree of automation. A distinction can
be made between two perspectives in selecting the evolution steps: From the perspective
of a function developer, due to the reduced speed and the limited access to the scene, the
interstate during a trafﬁc jam is a suitable starting scenario. From the perspective of the
previously presented statistical considerations, a meaningful starting scenario would be
one in which the human as a comparison group would perform as badly as possible, i.e.
making as many errors as possible. As many errors as possible means a short distance,
making the veriﬁcation of the performance easier.
The revolutionary step—an autonomous vehicle without evolutionary intermediate
steps—contradicts this approach and seems unlikely.
21.6.2 Speeding up the Testing
Despite the evolutionary approach, the safety of new functions still has to be validated. To
speed this up, there are basically two adjustments that can be made: Firstly, the What can be
changed, and secondly the How. What test cases need to be inspected, and how will these
tests be performed? Schuldt et al. [10] call this the test case generation and the test execution.
21.6.2.1
Test Case Generation
The test case generation deﬁnes the tests to be carried out. According to Schuldt et al.
[10], the large number of inﬂuencing factors in the area of use and their value ranges result
in a conspicuous number of test cases. As already described, the systems currently in use
are based on the capability of humans and their options for controlling the vehicle. This
results in a stark reduction in the test cases theoretically required. Therefore, a metric
exists that enables a conclusion about the safety without testing all the situations. This
reduction does not apply for the autonomous vehicle, and therefore new ways must be
found of reducing the number of test cases for the autonomous vehicle. During the test
case generation, the requirements for a test concept detailed in Sect. 21.3 must be con-
sidered. In particular, the representativeness is at risk when test cases are omitted.
Here the approaches from Glauner [23] and Eckstein [24] describe the identiﬁcation of
relevant or critical situations in public road trafﬁc. Based on previously deﬁned event
classes, potential critical situations are identiﬁed during the test drives or large-scale ﬁeld
studies. These critical situations are incorporated into the test case generation, and less
critical situations can be omitted as a result. This reduction is based on the assumption that
situations that are less critical are covered by critical situations. A task that remains
unsolved at present is the search for a valid measure of risk that enables an evaluation in
the ﬁrst step, and the selection of critical situations in the second step.
Another procedure for reducing test cases is provided by Schuldt et al. [10]: A generic
test case generation is proposed to cover factors inﬂuencing the safety ensured by the
21
The Release of Autonomous Vehicles
443
system as sufﬁciently as possible. This should use black-box testing procedures and
combinatorics, and also be low-redundancy and efﬁcient. This approach is based on
statistical considerations without knowledge and experience of the test object, but it still
has the potential to reduce the test cases required.
The approach described by Tatar and Mauss [25] is also suitable for black-box testing:
an optimization is used for the generation of test cases. Here the input variables of a XiL
simulation are varied in such a way that the evaluation function to be deﬁned for the test is
optimized. Despite the challenge of the valid XiL simulation and the required evaluation
function, this approach provides the option to focus the test cases on those evaluated as
relevant.
A fourth theoretical approach is to use and test a safety concept using formal methods
[26]. Similarly to the human assumed to be a monitor and a part of the safety concept of
current vehicles, a veriﬁed reliable safety concept could make testing the overall func-
tionality of the vehicle in its complete representativeness superﬂuous. This would make a
reduction of the test cases possible.
21.6.2.2
Test Execution/Test Tool
Along with the possibility of reducing the test cases during the test case generation, the
test execution also has potential for speeding up the process. However, if we deviate from
real driving and select another testing tool for the test execution, there is always an
attendant simpliﬁcation. This is described in more detail by means of Fig. 21.10.
Figure 21.10 divides the testing tools into nine classes which are differentiated based
on how the vehicle and the environment are represented. The passenger is assigned to the
vehicle in this representation, as he/she is situated in the vehicle and does not actively
intervene in the autonomous driving.
Real driving represents both the environment and the vehicle in reality. Accordingly,
during these tests there is the risk of real accidents and their consequences. The envi-
ronment is not controlled, and this results in test situations based on the randomness of
reality; accordingly, the reproducibility for complex situations with other road users is not
a given. This testing tool can be used, at the earliest, with the ﬁrst roadworthy prototypes,
and therefore occurs at the end of the development process.

An alternative is to test real vehicles in an artiﬁcial environment: This corresponds to
driving on a test ground, as there situations are created artiﬁcially on the one hand, and on
the other the “road users” are conscious of being involved in a test. Reality is simpliﬁed
for the beneﬁt of safety, variability, observability and reproducibility. From economic
perspectives, while the test cases are tested speciﬁcally and do not have to be experienced
randomly as in real driving, setting up the test ﬁeld requires additional time and ﬁnancial
resources.
Additionally, an artiﬁcial vehicle could move within a real environment; in this case,
artiﬁcial refers to equipping the autonomous vehicle with a supervisor, for example, that
has the option to intervene in the driving task. This could be a test driver with a steering
wheel and pedals, or alternatively a technical system that is superior to the series system
due to its more powerful (additional) sensors. If components are represented artiﬁcially,
the closeness to reality suffers, but gains are made in terms of safety, reproducibility and
observability.
Along with the option of creating the environment and the vehicle artiﬁcially, there are
tools that use a virtual representation in the form of computer simulations. Here the two
ﬁelds that combine the real and the virtual have a gray background, because strictly
speaking they do not exist, because the task of sensors and actuators is to switch between
virtual and real signals. A real radar sensor cannot sense a virtual environment, and a
virtual converter cannot create real voltage.
However, what are possible are combinations of artiﬁcial and virtual environments and
vehicles. Examples of this are provided by different concepts of vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL).
To close the loop made up of actions and reactions of the environment and the vehicle,
real components are mapped in the simulation in the form of models. Here either the
sensors or actuators mentioned are stimulated, i.e. artiﬁcially instigated (examples of this
are simulation-based videos as stimulation for camera systems or dynamometers as
stimulation for drive actuators), or the testing tools directly simulate the power signals,
such as the electromagnetic wave, and try to represent real effects of sensors and actuators
in the simulation with the aid of models. For more information on this, see Bock [27] or
Hendricks [28]. The use of models described calls the meaningfulness of these testing
tools into question. To get valid results using such models, it must be veriﬁed that these
models do not contain any impermissible simpliﬁcations; here impermissible is to be seen
in the context of the function, and means that deviations from reality are only permissible
below the tolerances of the function. However, if this validity has been veriﬁed, the testing
tool enables greater safety during the test execution, as parts of the environment and the
vehicle only encounter each other in the virtual world. Due to the virtual components,
these testing tools are distinguished by greater variability, observability and repro-
ducibility. From an economic perspective, this testing tool has the advantage of varying
the virtual environment easily or representing the vehicle in a wide range of variants. An
economic disadvantage could be the validation of the models (see below). An advantage
21
The Release of Autonomous Vehicles
445
of this testing tool is the option, based on the simulated vehicle, of performing tests early
on during the development.
The last level of abstraction represents the combination of a virtual vehicle and the
virtual environment: The software-in-the-loop testing tool represents the closed control
loop by modeling relevant components in the simulation. In contrast to the previous
testing tools, the entire testing world is virtual. The tests are safe, variable, observable and
reproducible; there is also the option of using this tool early on during the development.
The economic advantage is provided by the hardware independence, as there is no con-
nection to real time any more. The execution of the tests is only limited by the computer
power; simulations can be run day and night, and also parallel on a large scale. On the
other hand, there is the necessary closeness to reality of the virtual test world, and
therefore of every individual model: Only when the validity of the models used can be
veriﬁed are virtual tests sufﬁciently conclusive for a production release. Accordingly, for
the economic consideration of simulation-based procedures, the validation of the models
must be considered above all.
The same challenge exists for the use of formal methods. Mitsch [26] writes in this
context: “We do (…) prove that collisions can never occur (as long as the robot system ﬁts
to the model).” This means that even for formal methods, the degree of reality of the
models used determines the conclusiveness of the results. For example, a particular
challenge that is therefore a focus of the research is the formalization of the uncertainties
of sensors or the property of other road users.
The discussion relating to testing tools shows the potential to speed up the testing. With
the aid of the artiﬁcially created environment and vehicle, test cases can be set up and
executed speciﬁcally. Additionally, the virtual approach enables the tests to be speeded up
and run in parallel, depending on the computer power used.
However, the discussion also shows that the validity of the tests, and therefore their
conclusiveness, presents a challenge when artiﬁcial and virtual components are
introduced.
21.7
Conclusion
Autonomous driving is distinguished in particular by the omission of the human super-
visor of assisted or partially-automated systems, and the supervisor’s ability to correct
these systems. The metric consisting of real driving and driver’s license test that enables a
conclusion about the safety of automation levels currently present in series production, is
no longer valid for autonomous driving. The resulting loss of the reduction in the test
cases means that current test concepts are not suitable for economically assessing the
safety of a new system such as autonomous driving. Adhering to current test concepts
would involve an economically unjustiﬁable overhead, and would result in an
“approval-trap” for autonomous driving. However, the authors see three approaches for
avoiding this “approval-trap”.
446
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
Firstly, the evolutionary approach, or alternatively the transformation (see Chap. 10),
seems necessary, as only the step-by-step introduction along the different dimensions of
speed, scenery and degree of automation enables existing components to be taken over
and reduces the range of tasks for the following releases. Secondly, the necessary test
cases must be reduced based on ﬁeld experience and statistical procedures. The challenge
here is the metric that allows a conclusion to be drawn about the safety of the system
based on the completed test cases. Thirdly, alternative testing tools must be used alongside
real driving. Here it is not expected to be able to do without real driving completely,
because a veriﬁcation of validity is required to move test cases to ViL, SiL and procedures
that formally prove safety.
Finally, it must be stated that the challenges presented should not only be solved
internally by the automobile industry. Even if test concepts are optimized for autonomous
driving, there will not be 100 % safety. Vision Zero remains a vision for now, particularly
in mixed operation with additional road users. With the ﬁrst accident caused by an
autonomous vehicle, at the latest, the previously issued release will be put to the test.
Accordingly, the basis for the production release should be discussed publicly by all
concerned and be designed transparently.

Introduction
With autonomous driving, a technological system will replace humans in driving auto-
mobiles. The car industry, universities, and large IT companies, are currently working on
implementing functions permitting a technological system to take on vehicle operation.
Their focus is on the tasks that are also done by humans: of perception, cognition, deciding
how to act (planning) and carrying out this behavior (acting). In addition, humans possess
further capabilities not directly connected to driving a vehicle. For example, learning
directly changes people’s capacity to tackle tasks. In the driver-vehicle-environment sys-
tem, this human capability raises a question: Will the technological system that is to replace
humans also exhibit a capacity to learn? In the most diverse ﬁelds, primarily IT-driven
ones, there are learning and learned systems of the most varied kinds, which rival con-
ventional analytical systems in their performance. What marks out vehicle automation,
though, is ﬁrstly its relevance to safety; secondly, how cars as a product additionally differ
from other IT-industry goods in their system life cycles. Both of these particularities, with
their challenges and attempts at solutions, are the subject of this chapter. Attention is also
given to collective learning in the context of autonomous driving, as directly exchanging
with and copying from the learned is one of the particular advantages machine learning has
over the human version.
Replicating human learning in machine learning occupies a whole area of research. It is
expected that examining the processes of human learning will both provide a deeper

understanding of this process and improve applied machine-learning methods. With ref-
erence to the currently understood difference between both forms of learning, machine
learning is understood in this chapter as an algorithm generated by a human. The running
of the software follows these algorithms, just as with all other software. Our objective is
not to compare a learning human with a learning robot. Rather, it is to discuss why,
whether, and with which challenges and approaches machine learning is possible in its
current form in autonomous driving. This chapter portrays the view of vehicle technology
in particular on this question, and is based on experience from the literature for the area of
machine learning.
22.2
Vehicle, Environment and Learning Drivers
When a driver drives a vehicle in any environment, it constitutes target-oriented behavior.
According to Rasmussen [1, 2], people display behavior here that can be divided into
three areas. They behave according to their skills, rules, and knowledge (see Fig. 21.6 in
Chap. 21). Skill-based behavior is described by Rasmussen [1] as stimulus-response
automatism, which people overcome in routine everyday situations without placing
intensive demands on cognitive capacities.
Rule-based behavior proves to be more cognitively demanding. It requires associative
classiﬁcation in addition to perception and motor actions. People in this case match the
recognized situation to a known rule and, based on this, select from a repertoire of
behavioral rules. People have learned these rules purposely, or noticed (“saved”) them in
past situations and behavior. This gives people the ability to identify similar situations and
transfer learned rules to them.
Should situations arise that are new for people, and for which they have no trained
behavior, then their response will be knowledge-based. People try, based on their trained
knowledge, to generate and evaluate the alternative ways to act that are available to them.
The subjectively optimal alternative is selected and carried out.
Rasmussen’s [1] understanding of target-oriented behavior makes clear what is meant
by a learning driver. At the beginning of their “career,” a driver builds up their basic
knowledge of road trafﬁc in theory courses at driving school. This is then tested. In the
process, this knowledge builds on what has already been learned by living in society. In
addition, rule-based behavior is trained via theory and practice lessons. Upon obtaining
their driver’s license, people can then drive on public roads without further supervision
(exception: driving when accompanied with a license at 17 in Germany). However,
drivers at this point in time have neither learned all the rules nor processed the knowledge
needed for their future lives on the road. With each new piece of experience they gain,
their behavior transforms from knowledge-based to rule-based, and from rule-based to
skill-based. Training thus enables an increase in efﬁciency in human behavior [1].
If we consult the ﬁgures for car drivers involved in accidents per million passenger
kilometers, then according to Oswald and Williams [3, 4] the risk falls with increasing
452
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
human age, until it starts to rise again from 40 to 50. According to Burgard [5], experience
gained with age is responsible for this, alongside character skills (personality) and mental
and physical prerequisites. If we view the assimilation of experience as a learning process,
then the capacity to learn contributes to improved driving skills [6].
If road trafﬁc followed clear and known rules, people would not need to behave in the
ways described above. Road trafﬁc, however, is an open system consisting of static and
dynamic objects, and a multitude of environmental factors such as light levels and rain.
Even if only to a limited extent compared to beginner drivers, experienced road users
continue to come across unknown situations that need dealing with. It is because people
show just this knowledge-, rule- and skill-based behavior that today’s road, with its
efﬁciency, accuracy, and safety, is possible.
Further, this behavior leads to individually varied driving behavior. In one and the
same situation, drivers act differently and have different preferences in selecting distances,
speeds and acceleration.
It is precisely these capabilities enabled by skill-, rule-, and knowledge-based behavior
that will be taken out of driving upon automation, and replaced with corresponding
capabilities in driving robots.
22.3
Learning Technical Systems
The term machine learning stands for a research area dealing with methods for designing
algorithms. A particular feature of these algorithms is the automatic improvement of
technical systems based on experience. In this, the automatic improvement follows rules
and measures previously deﬁned by the human developer. The hotly debated ideas of
completely free and creatively acting machines, were they to exist at all, are not our focus
here. In employing machine learning, a clearly deﬁned task is needed, with accompanying
assessment metrics and (training) data.
An oft-used quote for the deﬁnition of machine learning is from Mitchell [7]:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T
and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with
experience E.
According to Mitchell [7], machine learning has proved itself in service particularly in
the following circumstances:
(a) There is a large quantity of data in a database that, by implication, potentially
contains valuable information that can be extracted automatically.
(b) People only have limited understanding of a certain area and thus lack the knowledge
for effective algorithms.
(c) In tasks demanding dynamic adjustment to changing conditions.
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
453
How these deﬁnitions and their usage areas ﬁt to autonomous driving is discussed in
Sect. 22.4. First, however, we shall take a look at the processes of machine learning. With
the aid of examples from various ﬁelds, we will explore the range of usage possibilities
before examining the task of autonomous driving in particular.
22.3.1 Overview of the Various Machine-Learning Processes
Breiman [8] noted the following in 2001:
In the past ﬁfteen years, the growth in algorithmic modeling applications and methodology
has been rapid. It has occurred largely outside statistics in a new community – often called
machine learning.
In [9], the ﬁrst machine-learning operations are traced back to McCulloch and Pitts in
1948, among others. The multiplicity of learning processes thus makes a detailed
description of all of them impossible. Therefore, the following will describe categories of
learning problems into which we may at least group the processes [10–12].
Supervised learning
Supervised learning, or learning with a teacher, is characterized by pre-assessed training
data (labeled data). This training data—the experience that machine learning builds on—
contains the input and output parameters of a learning problem. In the classiﬁcation of
whether airbags are deployed in an accident or not, for example, training data would
consist of acceleration values and the corresponding assessments (deploy or not). These
assessments must be made by an expert/teacher, for example, or by observation over time.
The learning process then uses these empirical values to determine the output for newly
observed input values. In the transfer of empirical values onto new input values, we can
distinguish [10] between lazy (memory-based) learning and eager (model-based) learning.
In lazy learning, the training data are saved during the learning and a similarity measure
is deﬁned. This similarity measure can vary in its complexity, and ranges from the simple
Euclidian distance to complex distances in case-based reasoning. When output values are
sought for new input values, the most similar training data to the new case are determined
and output values derived from them. This procedure corresponds to transductive infer-
ence [13]. In eager learning, in contrast, a global model based on training data is con-
structed during the training phase (induction). Output values for new cases are obtained by
deduction from the model.
Unsupervised learning
For unsupervised learning, or learning without a teacher, training data are also on hand,
although in this case with no assessment or output values (unlabeled data). In this learning
process, the aim is to ﬁnd a structure in the data, and classify the data according to the
structure. The training data are here used to reveal these structures and, based on this, to
classify newly observed input values.
454
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning differs from both of the previous processes in that few or no
training data are available to begin with. The training data required for a striven-for
improvement are collected by an agent1 itself by carrying out the task to be optimized
according to a ﬁxed scheme. An assessment of the execution of the task feeds back into
the learning process, forming a training dataset of input and output values that are used for
further optimization steps. The approaches of reinforcement learning are exposed to the
so-called innovation dilemma, for “exploration” and “exploitation” contradict each other.
March [15] describes it thus:
Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, exper-
imentation, play, ﬂexibility, discovery, innovation. Exploitation includes such things as
reﬁnement, choice, production, efﬁciency, selection, implementation, execution.
Corresponding to the learning problem, a balance for both has to be found, as, on the
one hand, an optimal execution is sought in a partly unknown search area, and, on the
other, this search is limited by external conditions such as costs, safety and time.
Alongside the question of whether, and in what form, training data are available, the
learning problem can also be distinguished based on the use of training data.
Batch learning
In batch, or ofﬂine learning, a set of training data is applied at a time point to make use of
the learning methods. If the learning method produces a model, for example, this model is
not updated by further experience gained during its use.
Online learning
Online learning is characterized by an iterative process, in which new experiences are
incorporated into the learning process. The aim is to continually optimize how the task is
tackled, in the process incorporating experience from the operation. This results in system
behavior changing from experience and thus over time.
These different types of learning problems require the use of various methods of
machine learning [12]. These range from decision trees, artiﬁcial neural networks, and
genetic algorithms to support vector methods, instance-based learning, hidden Markov
models, value iteration and Q-learning, etc. These methods have in common that how well
they deal with a learning problem depends on three fundamental properties. Firstly, the
methods are only in a position to optimally solve the learning problem if data (experience)
relevant and representative to the operation are used in sufﬁcient quantity for learning.
Secondly, the same applies for the quality of training data, so that the handling of noisy,
inaccurate or partial data is especially necessary for actual measured variables. Alongside
the test data, the assessment of performance (P) represents a further challenge. The
1Russell [14] deﬁnes it thus: “An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment
through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors.”.
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
455
methods will also only correctly deal with the learning problem if the assessment is valid
with real data for the whole operational area.
22.3.2 Examples
The following examples serve as a small sample for areas that can be addressed with the
processes of machine learning.
Airbag deployment [16, 17]
The learning problem consists of classifying sensor values to order the deployment of a
vehicle airbag. A classiﬁer is learned for this, which puts accidents either in the class of
“deploy” or that of “do not deploy.” In this example, the dataset of an accident has 30
dimensions, and consists, for instance, of acceleration, pressure and impact-sound sensors
at various positions in the vehicle. For 40 training datasets, in which the sensor values are
recorded for representative accidents, it is annotated (labeled) whether an airbag
deployment would be necessary or not.
Vehicle-path control system with artiﬁcial neural network [18]
The ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network) project had the aim of
positioning a vehicle on its optimal path within its lane. The training data consisted of the
input parameters of the individual pixels of a camera image, and the associate output
parameters of the steering angle. These are recorded during the journey of a human driver.
An artiﬁcial neural network whose 960 input nodes receive the individual values of the
30 × 32 pixels of the camera image is learned. These input nodes are connected via 4
hidden nodes with the 30 output nodes, which each stand for a different curvature.
22.4
Automation that Replaces the Learning Driver
For the car industry, machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence are of interest not only for
the automation of driving, but also in other ﬁelds such as design, production and
after-sales management [19]. These areas, and that of infotainment, are not our concern,
however. Our focus is on vehicle automation, which, as presently understood, consists of
the following components in moving a vehicle on public roads:
1. Perception of the environmental and vehicle state variables
2. Cognition of these state variables to arrive at a representation of the world
3. Behavior planning based on this representation
4. Execution of selected behavior
These components give the properties that have, according to Mitchell (see Sect. 22.3),
already led to successful machine-learning operations. Increasing perception of environ-
mental and vehicle state variables gives an enormous amount of machine-readable
456
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
information. Firstly, this is down to continued increases in sensor performance and signal
processing power, so that a detailed picture of the world is available for machine pro-
cessing. Secondly, the numbers of sensors and vehicles equipped with them are rising as
we approach full automation. It follows from this that the quality and quantity of training
data for machine learning is increasing. The second property especially applies for certain
areas of cognition and behavior decisions, since work on the human processes that are to
be replaced is largely theoretical at this stage (Sect. 22.2). Based on the EU-funded
Human Brain Project and associated studies, it is evident that there are still many ques-
tions that remain unsolved, and that the knowledge needed for effective algorithms is
lacking. The third property is generated by road trafﬁc. As already described in Sect. 22.2,
the world in which vehicles move requires adjustments to be made to changing envi-
ronmental conditions. This is why machine learning in automation suggests itself to be
implemented in such a way that it will be able to adjust to these changes.
Alongside these three motivators for employing machine learning, however, there are
particular challenges opposed to it. What the four components needed for autonomous
driving (perception, cognition, behavior planning, behavior execution) particularly have in
common, as opposed to other machine-learning applications, is the intervention in the
actual behavior of the vehicle. This means that, regardless of where undesired behavior
appears in this chain, it may develop into a breakdown or an accident. In order to debate
the deployment of machine-learning processes in vehicle automation, we will now classify
safety-related systems and allocate vehicle automation to one of these classes.
22.4.1 Safety Systems
According to ISO26262, safety is the “absence of unreasonable risk.” The extent to which
a system in a car (or also generally) impacts this safety can be determined in the following
ways ([16] extended):
1. Not safety-relevant
Errors in these systems do not lead to any dangers for persons or the environment.
Language recognition, where machine-learning processes are often employed on [20],
is not safety-relevant, for example, when used in infotainment. Such systems are
therefore already in use; although errors do regularly crop up to some extent, they do
not negatively impact safety.
2. Safety-relevant
A system is deemed relevant to safety if an error in it may result in danger to persons
or the environment.
a) Decision-making support systems
Here, the decision maker has the choice of whether to act on the system’s suggestions
or not. An anesthetist, for example, receives suggestions for dosages based on
information on the patient, operation, and previous experience. A system error would
endanger the patient, though only when the anesthetist follows the suggestion [21].
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
457
b) Systems for monitoring and diagnosis
A system error leads to a warning failing to appear and can, if the error is not
otherwise spotted, become a danger to people and the environment. If a diagnostic
system in industrial machinery fails, the absence of this diagnosis may be dan-
gerous [22].
3. Safety-critical
Systems where an error directly leads to persons or the environment being endangered.
(a) Supervised/correctable automation
If an action is carried out automatically without additional conformation, then a
failure of an automatic system directly leads to a hazard for people or the envi-
ronment. If the system is additionally supervised by a human, and if the possibility
of correcting it is provided, then this hazard may be avoided. The person super-
vising brings the system back under control, so that human involvement creates
fault-tolerance. It is to be kept in mind here that, particularly with increasing
automation of processes and the further relieving of human tasks, people’s
capacities to supervise an automated process will decreases [23]. The so-called
congestion assistant, as partially automated vehicle control, represents just such a
safety-critical system, as faulty system behavior would pose a direct danger. This
danger, however, is addressed by the driver’s supervision, because the congestion
assistant is developed in such a way that humans, by intervening, correct the faulty
system behavior. The system is designed for controlability.
(b) Unsupervised/non-correctable automation
The most critical form of automation in terms of safety is that with no possibility of
correction. Without supervision, a failure of the system leads to danger and,
depending on the situation, damage to people or the environment. Fully automated
driving falls in this category, as, by deﬁnition, the vehicle’s occupants are no longer
supervising it. Undesired behavior, or a failure or malfunction not addressed by the
system, thus leads directly to people and the environment being put in danger and
possibly harmed.
This categorization and the classiﬁcation of autonomous driving in the unsupervised
automation category shows why machine-learning processes as they currently stand
cannot simply be carried over from the two levels less critical to safety (non-critical and
relevant). Not without reason are the safety-critical examples from Sect. 22.3.2 reports on
studies without reference to non-supervised application.
The application of machine-learning processes in unsupervised or non-correctable
automation requires further differentiation, as different challenges arise depending on the
point in the vehicle’s system life cycle.
458
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
22.4.2 Challenges and Problem-Solving Approaches in the Various
Phases of the System Life Cycle
In this account, vehicle life cycles are broken up into ﬁve phases—research, development,
operation, service and change of user/end of vehicle life—as various challenges await
machine learning in each phase.
22.4.2.1
Research
When machine learning is applied in the research phase, the aim is mainly to establish
what its processes can do. The examples range from online, ofﬂine, supervised and
unsupervised, to reinforcement learning. Exemplary training datasets are drawn on as
databases. The same applies when assessing process performance and robustness. This is
carried out under controlled and/or supervised conditions, based on exemplary test data or
test runs. In particular, controlled conditions and/or deploying trained test drivers
(Category 3a Sect. 22.4.1) make faults tolerable, so that there are a multitude of existing
examples. Accordingly, proving its safety does not belong to the challenges of using
machine learning. The challenge here lies in accessing representative data for its later area
of application. The question thus arises of whether the research ﬁndings can be transferred
to the development and operational phases of the system life cycle.
22.4.2.2
Development
Learning during the development phase can be compared with ofﬂine learning. As many
application-relevant training data as possible are selectively gathered, for example to learn
a model during development.
The fulﬁlling of safety demands in the results is, as in all other safety-relevant vehicle
components, veriﬁed and validated, so that the vehicle can be released for production and
operation. Afterwards, neither the learned model nor the classiﬁcation change further. The
learning process does not work online and is not adaptive, and thus does not use further
data gained in operation as training data to update the model or classiﬁcation. During use,
it thus constitutes a time-invariant system, where the known methods for veriﬁcation and
validation remain valid. But it should be borne in mind that the results of the various
machine-learning processes can vary in their interpretability. For example, learned deci-
sion trees of limited extent, or a manageable set of learned rules, are easy to interpret [24]
and thus permit the use of white–box test procedures [25]. Other methods such as random
forests or sub-symbolic neural networks, on the other hand, are difﬁcult for testers to
interpret and thus represent a black–box.
For such complex components, proving safety poses a large challenge compared to
analytical models. Because the brute force test,2 as for most analytical models, is not
2The brute force approach stands for testing all possible combinations of the parameters inﬂuencing
the object under test behavior.
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
459
suitable [26] for systems with high input dimensionality, the following four counter-
measures from Otte [24] are often used as a result:
(a) Breaking down problems of many dimensions into submodels of fewer dimensions,
so that the submodels can be interpreted and validated by experts
(b) Employing reference solutions which permit the safety of the learned components to
be analyzed
(c) Limiting the input, output and state variables to speciﬁed value ranges, such as those
of the training data, for example. These limits may be static, but also dependent on
other variables
(d) Limiting the dynamics of the input, output and state variables to minimal, maximum,
positive or negative changes per time unit
Each of these measures restricts the potential of machine learning in order to allow
testing of the learned model.
22.4.2.3
Operation
When the fully developed and manufactured vehicle is put into operation, data accrue on
the real usage area, the static environment, other users and their behavior, and the vehicle
user and occupants. In addition, the vehicle has data on its machine behavior over time.
This directly available new information, which was previously inaccessible, encourages
the use of online learning processes, and thus also adaptive systems. The vehicle thus
becomes a time- or experience-variant system. This further degree of freedom in a
changing system with no additional supervision results in a particular challenge in testing
and safety validation, one that has not yet been solved for time-invariant autonomous
systems, see Chap. 21. Basically, there are two options for how a system that changes
during operation could be made safe. One option is to limit its adaptivity to a clearly
deﬁned enveloping area, such as the strategies of Adaptive Transmission Control [27].
Here, input, output and state spaces are restricted to a few parameters [28], so that, from
where we stand, validation and veriﬁcation during the development phase appears to be
possible. Should this restriction contradict the purpose of machine learning during
operation, then an online check of the changing, time-variant and complex system
becomes necessary [29]. The following two approaches can in turn be applied here [29].
Runtime veriﬁcation and validation
In contrast to conventional procedures of veriﬁcation and validation during the devel-
opment process by the developer, the system applies veriﬁcation and validation methods
during operation [26, 29, 30]. In principle, the adaptation process is seen as a feedback
loop. Figure 22.1 shows the four stages of observation, analysis, planning and execution,
which, according to Tamura et al. [30], are necessary for a structured examination of the
adaptation process. This picture can be directly transferred to online learning processes. If
a system adaptation is detected in this process, this then needs checking with runtime
veriﬁcation and validation processes before being applied to the software running. These
460
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
checks include whether, due to the applied changes to the system, it stays within the
viability zone. For autonomous driving, this means checking that any changes to the
driving robot comply with safety regulations before implementing them.
The procedures applied here, such as model checking or theorem proving, reach their
limits at this point, as described in Chap. 21. Using a software-in-the-loop procedure may
also be possible, although it is questionable if there is sufﬁcient processing power for such
processes in production vehicles.
Validation and veriﬁcation via monitoring and fault tolerance
If a system safety check prior to updating the software is not possible, a fault may arise
and lead to failure and thus also danger. To avoid this, the system is to be designed as fault
tolerant. Such a fault-tolerant system fundamentally requires two components [31].
Firstly, monitoring of system states and behavior to decide, based on an analysis, whether
there is a fault. Secondly, redundancy is required that can be transferred to in case of a
fault. Figure 22.2 shows this set-up schematically. This principle corresponds to a human
supervisor who takes over a part-automated vehicle control system when a fault occurs.
What this shows is that machine learning during operation poses a challenge, especially
for validating safe behavior. Both procedures—runtime veriﬁcation and validation and
veriﬁcation and validation through monitoring—need a way to measure safe driving.
Approaches for such measurements are outlined in Sect. 22.4.3.
Another approach is supplied here by a comparison with human learning. Road users
accept that humans, with no further screening, learn based on the measures they take while
driving and adjust their behavior accordingly. Checking whether adjusted behavior
complies with trafﬁc regulations does not transpire directly but, rather, sporadically via

police speeding and trafﬁc checks. In addition, other road users report highly erratic
behavior, such as accidents, so that human drivers receive feedback in their learning
process. Transferred to the technical system, this would mean that machine learning leads
directly to an adjustment of behavior. The test or check of whether this adjustment was
legitimate would follow in retrospect from other road users, the police or a special
supervisory authority. This approach reduces the demands placed on online validation and
veriﬁcation, as the skills of other road users are incorporated. If this test does not take
place until after the functions have been modiﬁed, and if there is also no other possibility
of intervention (in the control system), operating the updated but untested functions would
pose higher risks.
22.4.2.4
Service
Alongside machine learning during development and operation, there is a further phase in
the system life cycle where learning can take place. As part of servicing, training data
gathered by the vehicle can be downloaded and the vehicle functions updated. This does
not necessarily require the vehicle’s physical presence [32]. This procedure opens up the
feedback loop in Fig. 22.1. Corresponding to a further development stage, training data
and planned adaptations can be tested, so that the software system can be updated later
after safety has been assured. As these methods of machine learning can involve personal
data leaving the vehicle, security as well as safety needs to be borne in mind. For a more
in-depth look at this, see Chap. 24.
22.4.2.5
Change of User/End of Vehicle Life
Should, as is hoped, a vehicle be able to personalize how it drives for a user, or optimize
this for an area of operation, then, with a change of user or at the end of its life, these
learned capabilities and knowledge should stay with the user and not the vehicle. This
capacity then becomes of particular interest when, for example, ownership patterns change
as in Vehicle on Demand (see Chap. 2) where the user does not purchase a car but only its
mobility service. In principle, it is not difﬁcult for a technical system to transfer knowl-
edge. It is actually a strength of artiﬁcial systems that they can transfer this information
without the long-winded learning process. This is examined in more depth in Sect. 22.5.
22.4.3 Measures of Safe Driving
As described in the previous chapters, an evaluation of the vehicle’s driving in safety
terms is needed for both the machine-learning process in general and veriﬁcation and
validation during operation. In the ﬁrst instance, it can of course be seen retrospectively if
an accident has taken place, with what impact speed and energy, and how it came about.
This measurement has the drawback that the accident should not, if possible, have taken
462
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
place in the ﬁrst place. It follows from this that, for a safe system, accidents will be an
extremely rare event and thus hardly suitable for learning from.
What is needed is an evaluation that classiﬁes a journey as unsafe before it exceeds
physical driving limits. To this end, we shall differentiate between deterministic and
stochastic procedures in hazard assessment, as found in [33, 34].
22.4.3.1
Deterministic Procedures in Hazard Assessment
Following [35], we shall in addition distinguish between identiﬁers from driving dynamics
and identiﬁers from distances. The easiest values to determine, though with limited
informative value, are the limits for lateral and longitudinal acceleration and yaw rate. In
the 100 Cars Study [33], longitudinal accelerations of greater that 0.7 g are used as
triggers for detecting unsafe situations. Identifying critical situations with variables from
the ego-vehicle is not adequate, as other road users can bring even stationary vehicles into
dangerous situations. It is easy to see that a vehicle’s safety is also inﬂuenced by other
trafﬁc in its immediate surroundings.
If the environment is at the beginning ﬁrst reduced to parallel trafﬁc on one lane in each
direction, time-to-collision (TTC) or its reciprocal value give an indication of how safe a
situation is. For example, in ISO 22839 (Forward vehicle collision mitigation systems),
TTC ¼ xc
vr
deﬁnes the time that elapses until the ego-vehicle collides with an object at distance xc,
assuming the relative speed vr ¼ vego  vobj


remains constant. This measure can be
applied to both the preceding and the following vehicle. From the TTC, Chan [34] deﬁnes
a criticality index for which it is assumed that the severity of an accident is proportional to
the square of the speed:
Criticality Index ¼
v2
TTC
If the speed between the vehicles does not remain constant, the enhanced TTC is used.
In ISO 22839, this is derived thus:
ETTC ¼ vr 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
v2
r  2  ar  xc
p
ar
:
This equation only applies so long as the relative acceleration ar ¼ ðaobj  aegoÞ
remains constant. If a vehicle comes to a stop, the equation needs adjusting, see Winner
[35] on this. These values give an assessment of a state, equivalent to a situation analysis.
To enable an assessment of driving safety for all situations, the following procedures from
[36] are recommended:
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
463
– Number of Conﬂicts (NOC)
– Time Exposed TTC (TET)
– Time Integrated TTC (TIT)
The names of the procedures speak for themselves, so that we shall not dwell on them
here, but rather refer the reader to [36, 37]. Further simple measure include time headway
th ¼ xc
vego
and the necessary delay areq to avoid a rear-end collision. Further approaches based on the
foregoing can be found in [37–39].
When vehicles, objects and accelerations moving in a lateral direction are included, for
example, when studying situations at junctions, the metrics for a safety assessment have to
be expanded. Easily the simplest approach is Post-Encroachment Time (PET). This
temporal variable is deﬁned by [40] as “time between the moment that the ﬁrst road user
leaves the path of the second and the moment that the second road user reaches the path of
the ﬁrst.”
When observing the lateral direction, there are more objects than just the two
object-vehicles in relation to the ego-vehicle. These can inﬂuence the safety assessment
statically, but also in principle dynamically from any direction on the vehicle plane.
Tamke’s [41] approach is, for example, to identify the distance, and the distance’s time
derivation, to all objects in the vicinity of the ego-vehicle using Euclidian norms.
The TTC is determined based on these variables by ascertaining the time until contact
with the vehicle’s bodywork using predictions of behavior. This approach is still classiﬁed
as a deterministic procedure at this point, as the behavior of the ego-vehicle and the
dynamic objects follow the “constant turn and constant acceleration approach.” The
approach per se, however, also allows predictions to be made non-deterministically.
Deterministic procedures are suitable for ex-post safety assessments of a carried-out
maneuver or situation. If an online assessment of situations as they happen and a pre-
diction on a time horizon greater than 1 s is desired, however, then its application per se
will be ﬂawed as long as the situation contains uncertainties. Uncertainties here imply that
the development of a situation over time not only has a potential deterministic procedure,
as is often assumed in “constant turn and constant acceleration” models of simplicity, but
rather that many different situations can occur. For example, in calculating the TTC, the
car in front could, instead of slowing down, accelerate to alleviate a critical situation. In
order to incorporate these uncertainties into the hazard assessment, we will now take a
brief look at stochastic procedures.
22.4.3.2
Stochastic Methods in Hazard Assessment
A hazard assessment of two vehicles simply passing each other, as shown in Fig. 22.3,
clearly encourages the use of stochastic procedures. If deterministic behavior and an
extrapolation of speed are assumed, passing like this would pose no danger, as the
464
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
trajectories and areas occupied by the vehicles do not cross. This looks different when
uncertainties are taken into consideration. If a human-driven vehicle (Fig. 22.3 lower lane,
black) does not stay in its lane, this can be hazardous for the autonomous vehicle
(Fig. 22.3 upper lane, orange) and the immediate surroundings.
The associated risk results from the probability of an accident and its potential severity.
Both values involve unknowns that need to be estimated as accurately as possible.
The principal approach here [42] for determining probability is to predict the trajec-
tories of the ego-vehicle and objects in its vicinity, based on measured state variables. Due
to the uncertainties involving human drivers, sensors and actuators mentioned above, as
well as the interaction between the objects, there is not only one trajectory, but rather a
probability distribution of the states of all objects over time. If the potential areas occupied
by the objects overlap, an accident is probable. The possible states of the objects result
from the dynamic models used and the deﬁned limits for the dynamic variables. In [43], a
single-track model for vehicles is used here to ﬁnd a compromise between prediction
accuracy and computing time. In addition, dynamic variables such as acceleration and
steering rate are limited, according to the analysis of the author [43], to non-critical and
typical values. In [43, 44] an overview of alternative methods can be found. All methods
have in common that the dynamic simulation of a vehicle cannot proceed analytically
[41], so that numerical methods with accompanying discretization and simpliﬁcation are
to be used.
Including severity in the hazard assessment is approximated in [45] by a relative
assessment of each accident based on its inelastic collision. This corresponds to the
approach based on the Potential Collision Energy (PCE) [36]. Further, however, no
approach has been found that determines both severity and probability in combination.
One reason for this is imprecise analytical regression methods [46], another is
computing-intensive Finite Element Methods (FEM), which are currently used in other
ﬁelds for determining accident severity [47]. Meier et al. [46] provides a new approach
Fig. 22.3 Comparison of
predictions in a passing
situation: deterministic (above)
and stochastic (below)
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
465
here based on symbolic regression. Using a crash-situation database (produced from FEM
calculations), regression functions are learned which predict accident severity in a situ-
ation to a few milliseconds. This uses pre-crash information such as vehicle mass, speeds,
collision point and collision angle. The downside of this approach is its limited inter-
pretability, as the regression model does not include any physical variables. If this
approach gave a valid prediction for severity, it would be possible to extend an assessment
of risk into one of severity.
The above-mentioned procedures are not yet sufﬁcient to assess adaptive automated
driving’s safety, for the following reasons. Firstly, all the approaches are based on a series
of simpliﬁcations, such as leaving out weather conditions, simplifying the driving
dynamics, or not including sensor uncertainties. Secondly, the procedures as they stand do
not provide any validated and combined ascertainment of the probabilities and severity of
accidents. A general deﬁnition and assessment of vehicle-driving safety therefore does not
currently exist.
However, the ongoing progress in vehicle automation does provide enabling factors.
These are, ﬁrstly, removing the uncertainty of the driver (ego-vehicle). Although human
behavior continues to be present in the form of other road users, the trajectory of the
ego-vehicle is known within its control performance. Moreover, current vehicles’ sensor
performance is rising, reducing uncertainties in the state of the object. Further, additional
information on the surroundings is exchanged via V2X communication, thus improving
the points of reference for hazard assessment in both quality and quantity.
22.5
Automation as Part of a Learning Collective Group
In this chapter, our analysis of learning vehicles has so far restricted itself to the system
life cycle of a particular vehicle. What vehicle automation implicitly brings with it,
however, is the duplication of hardware and software across a whole group of vehicles in
the aimed-for mass production. Vehicles operating in road trafﬁc would consequently
have the same capabilities. On the one hand, this has the drawback that driving errors,
breakdowns and accident types would affect not only one vehicle but the whole group. On
the other, it gives adaptive systems a further degree of freedom. The option of exchanging
data makes collective learning during operation possible. Two approaches may in prin-
ciple be distinguished here [48]: agent-based machine learning and machine learning with
agents. In the former (also often called agent-based swarm intelligence), the learning
collective system is made up of a multitude of networked agents with limited cognitive
capacity. The behavior of animals such as ants or bees is often drawn on in this connection
[49]. In contrast, though, machine learning with agents also consists of several agents,
466
W. Wachenfeld and H. Winner
these employ the procedures described in Sect. 22.3. These two approaches differ in the
fundamental stages of machine learning in terms of:
– generation of collective experience
– collective performance evaluation
– derivation of learned models and knowledge
Essentially, the approaches can be applied as soon as data from real situations has been
gathered. This raises questions: At which position of a group is relevant information
gathered from the data and assessed in terms of the learning problem and performance
measurements? Can learning methods be used that are based on this? Not least for reasons
of limited data-transfer bandwidth, it will be necessary to transfer pre-processed data or
even learned models and knowledge rather than raw sensor data. So long as the partici-
pating agents/vehicles belong to a series and software release, there will be challenges for
the integrity of the transferred information, although not in compatibility and trustwor-
thiness between agents. So-called homogeneous teams exist in which how and what is
being learned is known among the group. If the aim, however, is to expand the database
which learning methods are applied to, vehicles with different software or even of different
manufacturers could also be networked to each other. This amounts to a collective of
heterogeneous vehicles in which potentially different machine-learning procedures are
used, and the knowledge representation is likewise heterogeneous. Reference [50] gives
examples from other areas of how such collectives could in principle be handled.
Essentially, as well as vehicle robots, there are other agents, such as smartphones or also,
in future, service robots, which likewise gather data covering completely different areas to
those accessible to the driving robot. The currently highest conceivable level of
connectivity, and by some distance the largest database, is the internet. The autonomous
vehicle as a web-enabled device permits a great number of applications and functions, for
better or worse. Not least, IBM’s Watson Project shows that part of the knowledge
archived in the internet is also comprehensible to machines. Information made accessible
on the internet by any authority would therefore not need to be learned through experience
ﬁrst to inﬂuence an autonomous vehicle’s behavior. On the other hand, access to any
(unauthorized or anonymous) source threatens to create problems in terms of both road
trafﬁc safety and data security (see Chap. 24).
22.6
Conclusion
Machine learning is of great interest to current research, as the quality and quantity of
available data is constantly increasing and, in addition, vehicle automation is throwing up
questions that can only be partly solved with conventional analytical approaches. In
carrying research ﬁndings over to the development of functions in the driving of auton-
omous vehicle, proving their safe use in unsupervised safety-critical systems with no
possibility of correction poses the greatest challenge. Therefore, according to the authors’
22
Do Autonomous Vehicles Learn?
467
knowledge, learned models that do not change after testing and approval can already be
found in current mass-production vehicles. Systems such as Adaptive Transmission
Control are not the subject of our examination due to their negligible adaptive parameters
in clearly deﬁned limited value ranges. However, learning and adaptation while in
operation is giving automation an extra degree of freedom.
Exploiting this degree of freedom is motivated by the possibility of optimizing auton-
omous journeys, compensating for the loss of people’s capacity to adjust and learn, and
individualizing vehicle-driving. This chapter has highlighted that applying machine
learning in vehicle automation during operation requires greater attention in terms of both
road safety and data security. There is currently no valid measure for assessing trafﬁc safety
in respect of risk. Therefore, it seems clear that the use of adaptive machine-learning
processes while in operation ﬁrst requires a fault-tolerant set-up with redundant conven-
tional systems, with the latter serving to assess road safety. It is thus to be expected that
machine learning while in operation (adaptive systems) will initially only optimize vehicle
automation within the framework of the conventional system.
Due to the challenges highlighted with respect to proving the safe behavior of
time-invariant adaptive systems, it appears necessary to do intensive further research on
runtime veriﬁcation and validation. The same holds for the above-mentioned applied
non-adaptive systems and their demonstration of safety. Although there is copious liter-
ature on examples that have already been successfully introduced, these mostly come from
other ﬁelds that do not place comparable demands on a product.
In this chapter, we have examined the question of data security only peripherally—for
a more in-depth discussion, see Chap. 24. Learning approaches require data and hence
information on occupants, the vehicle and the environment. Data protection is thus of the
same relevance as road safety. It should be pointed out that the environment also contains
people, which implies protecting their data. The quality and quantity of the sensors needed
for vehicle automation is a boost for machine learning on the one hand, but on the other
they are regarded with suspicion from a data protection point of view. One special
property of vehicle sensors is, in addition, that they currently are to a great extent not
physically covered when the vehicle or function is not active. With the application of
machine learning, data security should also accordingly be addressed directly.
Nevertheless, the application of networked agents and learning systems has its
advantages, whose effects are not to be underestimated. Collectively learning agents need
not acquire available knowledge slowly. Instead, this information can be copied and
pasted to the next vehicle or software generation. This, in combination with access to the
large quantity of electronically recorded information, has the potential to change the
driving of vehicles, road trafﬁc and thus people’s overall (mobility) behavior. This makes
the ﬁndings gained for driving equally interesting to research into medical robots, and also
468

domestic robots with human contact. Due to the similar conditions, the reverse also
applies, which speaks for close cooperation between vehicle technology and robotics.

Safety Concept for Autonomous Vehicles
Andreas Reschka
The development of autonomous vehicles currently focuses on the functionality of vehicle
guidance systems.1 Numerous demonstrations of experimental vehicles have shown their
impressive capabilities—listed here with the most recent named ﬁrst. For example, the
drive on the Bertha-Benz route undertaken by the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology and
Daimler AG [69], the Stadtpilot project of the Technische Universität Braunschweig
[41, 60], activities of Google Inc. [13, 59], the BRAiVE Research Institute and the VIAC
Project of the VisLab Institute of the University of Parma [4, 8], the research activities of
the Collaborative Research Centre 28 of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [31, 55,
57] and the results of the DARPA Urban Challenge [51–53]. If the experimental vehicles
were driving in trafﬁc on public roads, a safety driver2 was always in the vehicle to
monitor the technical system. This person had to intervene if a technical defect occurred
meaning that the current situation was beyond the capabilities of the vehicle or if another

1A vehicle guidance system is a technical system that steers the vehicle without human
intervention. Unlike driver assistance systems, no monitoring by a human driver is necessary. The
system, consisting of the vehicle and vehicle guidance system, forms an “autonomous vehicle”. The
meaning of the term “driving robot” is very similar to that of the vehicle guidance system. However
it is frequently understood as a mechatronic system, which operates a vehicle like a human (see
http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/mrm/forschung/mechatronik/kognitiver-fahrroboter.html). To avoid con-
fusing the two, the term “driving robot” will not be used in this article.
2The article will use the terms “driver” and “safety driver” to indicate human drivers and safety
drivers.

event necessitated this. This necessary monitoring of the technical system means that the
indicated test drives on public roads are classiﬁed as semi-automated according to [20].
However, the aim of future vehicle guidance systems with higher levels of automation is
to operate the systems independently in all situations without human monitoring.
Therefore, in the development of vehicle guidance systems, a safety concept is required
that covers the various steps of the development process, such as the speciﬁcation, design,
development and the functional tests. In addition safety functions that can attain or attempt
to sustain a so-called safe state are required in the system.
23.1
Safe State
The use of the term safe state is often ambiguous. Safety is a relative concept and depends
on the individual perception of the observer. According to the ISO 26262 standard, an
operating mode of a system or an arrangement of systems can be regarded as safe when
there is no unreasonable risk (see “safe state”, ISO 26262, Part I, 1.102 [30]). This means
that a safe state is only present when the current and future risk is below a threshold
accepted in society (see “unreasonable risk”, ISO 26262, Part I, 1.136 [30]). This
threshold is to be regarded as a value of what is not acceptable in a speciﬁc context
according to social, moral or ethical considerations (see ISO 26262, Part I, 1.136 [30]).
Risk is to be understood as a combination of the probability of occurrence and the severity
of the personal injury (see “risk” and “harm”, ISO 26262, Part I, 1.99 and 1.56).
This deﬁnition allows us to understand a safe state as a state where risk from the system
is reasonable. The frequently used term risk-minimized condition (e.g. in [20]) can be
misunderstood as this does not place the risk in relation to an accepted risk and does not
specify whether the system that is being operated with minimum risk is also safe.
The essential challenge when using the term safe state, in the sense of a condition with
an acceptable level of risk for passengers and other road users, is the identiﬁcation of a
threshold under which the risk level is acceptable. When operating an automated vehicle,
the level of acceptable risk depends on the current situation of the vehicle. The situation
includes the following, according to [21] and [43]:
– All stationary and dynamic objects relevant to a driving decision
– The intention of the dynamic objects including the autonomous vehicle
– The pertinent legal conditions
– The mission of the autonomous vehicle
– The current power capability of the autonomous vehicle.
Therefore, for an autonomous vehicle, the current risk must be continuously deter-
mined on the basis of the current situation and a comparison of the risk with the threshold
value that is regarded as still just about acceptable. In the sense of the ISO 26262 standard,
474
A. Reschka
this means that the likelihood of personal injury and the severity of the injuries must be
determined for every situation and all ways in which the situation can develop and the
courses of action that present a reasonable and acceptable level of risk must be identiﬁed.
The author is currently not aware of a technical solution for this problem.
23.1.1 Safe State in Driver’s Assistance Systems Used
in Series-Production Vehicles
In the case of driver’s assistance systems, the driver monitors the technical system and has
to pay close attention to the trafﬁc situation. The driver is supported when driving. The
current Mercedes-Benz p Class models are available with a system called “DISTRONIC
PLUS with Steering Assist and Stop&Go Pilot”. This system supports the driver in
guiding the vehicle both laterally as well as longitudinally [49]. The driver still needs to
follow events on the road, and the steering assist system deactivates after a speciﬁed time
if the driver takes his hands off the steering wheel:
If the Steering Assist with Stop&Go Pilot detects that the driver has taken his hands off the
steering wheel during the journey, depending on the driving situation, the steering wheel
inertia sensor, the environment detected and the speed, the driver is warned in the instrument
cluster. If the driver does not respond, a warning tone is sounded and the steering assist is
deactivated. (Translated [49])
For this reason, the system is to be regarded as semi-automated according to the
standards laid out in [20] or as partial automation according to [48]. The longitudinal
guidance can also switch off and cede control to the driver with a corresponding signal as
soon as technical faults develop or—depending on the way the system is set—if speciﬁc
threshold values such as a minimum speed are no longer met [62].
Hörwick and Siedersberger [25] presents a safety concept for semi-automated and
highly automated driver assistance systems. However, the terms are again used differently
here. In [25], fully automated DAS (FA-DAS) actually means semi-automated according
to [20], as the driver has to monitor lateral and longitudinal motion. Autonomous DAS
(A-DAS) in [25] has the same meaning as fully automated according to [20], as the driver
does not need to constantly monitor the system and the system can attain a safe state on its
own. According to [24], a safe state is attained by stopping at a nonhazardous location. As
the focus is on a system for automated driving in trafﬁc jams on the freeway up to 60 km/h
(approx. 37 mph), stopping on a lane until a human takes over control appears as a safe
state. The relative speeds are assumed to be low due to the trafﬁc jam [24, 25].
A study on the potential of automated driving on freeways comes to the same con-
clusion [45]. This was drawn up as part of the development of an accident assistance
system that can stop a vehicle (safe state) in the event of the driver losing consciousness or
not being able to guide the vehicle for other reasons [32, 45]. Such a system is also
presented in [37]. The safety requirements here are higher than those for a trafﬁc jam
assistance system, as the vehicle is not supposed to simply stop but leave ﬂowing trafﬁc
23

and come to a standstill on the shoulder. In addition the system was designed for normal
freeway trafﬁc and not for trafﬁc jams, meaning the very high relative speeds can come
into play. This means that the requirements of the system are very high in terms of
reliability and environment/situation recognition, as other drivers/vehicles must be
observed when changing lanes onto the shoulder [45]. Redundant sensors that cover at
least the areas in front, to the rear and in countries that drive on the right, to the right side
of the vehicle are required here. The beneﬁts of such emergency assistance systems are
still present even if the system is not fully available due to technical defects. A vehicle that
is out of control on the freeway is more dangerous than a vehicle moving slowly or at a
standstill that is indicating in a suitable manner—even if switching lanes to the shoulder is
not possible [32, 37].
In summary, it is possible to say that, if a driver is present in the vehicle, driver
assistance systems can attain a safe state by handing control to the driver or by braking to
a standstill. The emergency assistance systems mentioned here can attempt to reach the
shoulder, however the requirements for this are relatively high. Even with systems with
higher levels of automation, handing over control to a driver who may be in the vehicle
and braking to a standstill comprise possible ways in which a safe state can be attained.
23.1.2 Safe State in Experimental Autonomous Vehicles
The following projects focus on autonomous vehicles on all types of roads and in all
environments. The developed systems should be able to take on the task of driving
completely and no longer require humans for monitoring purposes. There are only a few
publications on safety functions and safety concepts of the various projects. This could be
because it is relatively simple to deploy a human to monitor the vehicle and therefore not
to make use of comprehensive safety systems and also because the functional safety of the
systems for autonomous operation has not yet received the attention this ﬁeld deserves.
The projects taken into consideration are listed chronologically and the levels of
automation according to [20] and the safety mechanisms used are highlighted.
The projects from the 1950s to the 1990s focused solely on the functional aspects of
automatic vehicle guidance, such as the ﬁrst attempts to link infrastructure and the vehicle
in the General Motors Research Labs. This project involved implanting magnets in the
road surface that the vehicle could detect. The driver was required to maintain a constant
vigilance over the road trafﬁc and the system [17]. In the 1970s and ’80s in Japan research
was conducted in the ﬁeld of vehicle automation with the recognition of driving lanes with
imaging cameras. Again, the system was constantly monitored by the driver [58]. The
same applies for the research conducted in the 90s, for example the experiment No hands
across America 1995 of the Carnegie Mellon University [50, 56]. In this case only the
lateral guidance of the vehicle was automated. In terms of research in Europe, a test drive
conducted by the University of the Federal Armed Forces from Munich to Odense with
the VaMoRs-P experimental vehicle (again in 1995) must be mentioned. During this trip,
476

the lateral and longitudinal guidance was conducted automatically and supervised by the
driver. In addition, the automatic lane changes were initiated by the driver [36]. The
ARGO experimental vehicle of the VisLab Institute of the University of Parma achieved a
long-distance record in 1998. The level of automation covered not only lateral and lon-
gitudinal guidance but also lane changes initiated by the monitoring driver [7]. All of the
named projects are to be classiﬁed as semi-automated according to [20]. The safe state
was achieved by handing vehicle control to a monitoring driver or restored by inter-
ventions by the monitoring driver. A comprehensive overview of the developments of the
1990s can be found in Dickmanns’s work [14]. The focus here is on camera-based image
processing.
The Autonomes Fahren (Autonomous Driving) project in Lower Saxony in 1998 also
examined the development of autonomous vehicles. Binfet-Kull et al. [6] describes a
safety concept that involves various methods that are feasible and logical parts of today’s
systems. Table 23.1 lists error codes, the meaning of which and resulting actions could be
executed by the vehicle in order to attain a safe state. The selected categorization is also
possible in terms of the deﬁnitions of [20]. A detailed discussion of the actions will be
given in the context of the respective safe states for the use cases in Chap. 2.
In the DARPA Urban Challenge, all participating autonomous vehicles without drivers
were operated on an enclosed military base. The safety concept was prescribed by
DARPA and included an option for immediately stopping a vehicle via remote control and
by means of an emergency switch on the outside of the vehicle [2]. The safety concept of
the CarOLO team of the Technische Universität Braunschweig used the time after the
emergency stop to conduct self-rectiﬁcation actions [19, 22, 44]. This allowed
the autonomous vehicle to restart faulty components of the vehicle guidance system [2].
The other teams also followed a similar approach in the ﬁnal of the Urban Challenge
[51–53].

Emergency stopping via remote control as a last resort to attain a safe state was only
possible because the vehicles were driving in a secured area, followed by observation
vehicles. The other road users were either vehicles driven by professional drivers or other
autonomous vehicles. A test involving vehicles with the capabilities of the experimental
vehicles involved on public roads would have been too dangerous.
The Stadtpilot project of the Technische Universität Braunschweig has demonstrated
semi-autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2010 [41, 60]. The research of this
project focuses on fully-automated operation of the experimental vehicle—Leonie.
However, when driving on public roads a safety driver has to monitor trafﬁc and intervene
before dangerous situations can arise.
The vehicle guidance system transfers control of the vehicle to the safety driver if it
reaches the limits of the system’s abilities or if system faults occur. As no other safety
actions may be performed on public roads, the safe state is to transfer control to the driver.
As the system is partially capable of determining its own performance, for example the
quality of localization, other actions are then also possible. For example stopping at the
side of the road or even on the current driving lane is feasible, continuing travel with
greater distances to the vehicles ahead and with reduced speed is also possible, however,
this has only been tested on test tracks [46, 47].
Stanford University and the Volkswagen Electronic Research Lab 2010 demonstrated
automated driving with the Junior 3 experimental vehicle [35, 54]. The design of the
experimental vehicle is similar to that of Leonie from the Stadtpilot project. Automated
driving functions are controlled by silver switches. These facilitate a connection between
the vehicle guidance system and the actuators of the vehicle. In the fail-safe state, these
switches are open and there is no connection between the vehicle guidance system and the
vehicle. This means that control is in the hands of the necessary safety drivers. One special
feature is the valet parking function of the vehicle that can be used without a safety driver
in a closed-off area. For safety purposes the vehicle has a so-called e-stop function that
was used in a similar way to the one in the DARPA Urban Challenge. The vehicle
guidance system is monitored by a health monitor that detects malfunctions of software
modules and triggers self-rectiﬁcation functions. In addition the vehicle is capable of
operating the brakes and stopping independently. The stationary vehicle thereby attains
the safe state via the e-stop and the safety system.
In 2012, the VisLab Institute of the University of Parma demonstrated semi-automated
driving on public roads in a partially closed-off area with the BRAiVE experimental
vehicle. On parts of the circuit there were no drivers in the driver’s seat and only the front
passenger could intervene with an emergency stop button. An e-stop function was also
integrated [8, 23].
After the DARPA Urban Challenge, work continued at Carnegie Mellon University on
the BOSS experimental vehicle and an approach for monitoring and reconﬁguration in
real-time was developed and published [33]. This approach, called SAFER, uses redundant
software components that are usually switched to stand-by in normal operation and they
can be activated as required. This makes it possible to switch a defective component to a
478
A. Reschka
redundant solution within a very short time. As no hardware monitoring takes place, no
sensors and actuators are monitored, which means the approach can be used to supplement
hardware redundancy methods.
The last example of current autonomous vehicles development projects is the Self
Driving Car project of Google Inc. As a ﬁrst step of this project, vehicles approaching a
stage in which they are ready for series production were equipped with sensors and
operated on public roads in Nevada and California [13, 59]. Even though there is only
sparse information on the technology used in vehicles, use without safety drivers does not
seem possible at present. As described in [13], there are numerous situations that make too
many demands on the performance of the system. The safe state of these vehicles also
means the driver taking control. In 2014 a prototype was presented without operating
elements for the driver and therefore can certainly be classiﬁed according to [20] as fully
automated, as there are no possibilities for overriding the controls. However, this vehicle
has not been used on public roads to date.
23.1.3 Summary
As the projects described show, there is currently no comprehensive safety concept that
covers all requirements of vehicles without safety drivers on public roads. However, some
of the projects have demonstrated powerful safety functions that cover the different sit-
uations and events on the streets. If one assumes that in future the safe state is to attain the
speciﬁcations of the “ADOPTED REGULATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR
VEHICLES” section 16.2 (d) from Nevada, an autonomous vehicle must be capable of
leaving the trafﬁc ﬂow at any time during the journey and stopping at the side of the road
or on the shoulder [39]. This would require a lane change which in turn would depend on
reliably functioning environment perception, decision-making and their implementation.
Simply to stop as performed in some of the projects along with handing control of the
vehicle to the safety driver, is not sufﬁcient. The use of a combination of the preset vehicle
safety function approaches seems therefore to be necessary—probably other safety
measures need to be taken in order to attain a higher level of reliability [39].
23.2
Safety Concepts in Use in Series-Production in Other
Disciplines
In addition to autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems, functional safety also
plays an important role in other technological areas. The following section details safety
concepts from other disciplines and examines their suitability for autonomous vehicles.
23

479
23.2.1 Track Vehicles
Track vehicles have been operated automatically for several years already. On public
transport vehicles, a train driver is present in most cases to monitor the function of the
systems [66]. Unlike the autonomous vehicles under consideration here, safety functions
are frequently integrated in the infrastructure, for example track usage is coordinated in
centralized control centers and the monitoring components are integrated in the tracks.
The control systems have the task of avoiding collisions by ensuring the track sections are
only ever occupied by one train. This is implemented by sensors and systems (wayside
centric), such as axle counters at the entrance and exit of a section of track [42]. If a
section is occupied, the signals are switched accordingly to prevent another train entering.
The avoidance of collisions is therefore primarily a logistical problem particular to trafﬁc
operation technology. The mechanical lateral guidance without any degree of freedom on
rail vehicles reduces the complexity of the situations and the number of options for action.
Put simply, it all comes down to trains driving along free sections of track at a suitable
speed to avoid derailing. Monitoring the track in front of the train is not possible with
surround sensors due to the long stopping distances. However trains and carriages have
emergency stop functions that can be triggered by passengers and train drivers and even
externally on driverless trains.
On driverless trains, the speed of the journey is regulated automatically and in addition
to monitoring track occupancy by the infrastructure, the systems also have on-board
mechanisms (vehicle-centric). Communication between the control center and the vehicle
is performed via wireless technology in exactly the same way as communication between
platforms and driverless underground trains. Here, a redundant door monitoring system on
the platform and in the train can be used to prevent hazards arising from closing doors.
The communication-based train control (CBTC) has become a standard that is used in
numerous railway systems all over the world [42].
Such an automatic train driving system is used in the RUBIN underground system in
Nuremberg. Trafﬁc on the track is a mix of driverless trains and trains with drivers.3 An
essential component of the safety concept is the monitoring of the doors [38]. Components
of the automatic train protection systems (ATP) and automatic train operation (ATO) are
used; these are divided between stationary and on-board components. With ATP the speed
is kept below existing limits and safety stops and emergency stops are triggered. The
system must therefore fulﬁll the requirements of safety integrity level 4 (highest safety
level) according to the European standard IEC50128:2011 [29]. The necessary hardware
and software is inexpensive in relation to the comparatively high costs of track vehicles
compared with road vehicles.

23.2.2 Purely Electrical Control of Actuators (X-by-Wire)
On autonomous vehicles the actuators are triggered and controlled by means of electrical
signals. Gas, brakes, steering and special functions are controlled by controllers. The
X-by-Wire technology is not yet completely available in series-production vehicles. The
electronic gas pedal, the electromechanical steering and the electrohydraulic brake system
have been around for several years. However the steering and brakes still have a
mechanical/hydraulic linkage that is mostly permanent and only available as a fallback in
seldom cases if the electrical system fails.4 The driver can thereby control the vehicle even
without the electronic systems.
For autonomous vehicles, the actuators must therefore have several redundant control
circuits, as is the case in airplanes, for example. Both communications systems between
operating elements, control devices and actuators as well as operating elements, control
devices and actuators (including the energy supply) are installed multiple times so that in
the event of a fault, the redundant systems can be used [3]. In [67], a threefold redundant
control system for a Boeing 777 passenger airplane is presented. Each safety-relevant
component of the airplane control system is implemented in three different ways to
implement a high level of availability of the controls to the pilots or the autopilot. Due to
the criticality of vehicle piloting, in addition to the autopilots on passenger planes, it is
mandatory to have two human pilots [15].
The architecture used in airplanes and also the hardware and software used for
implementing this would appear to also be suitable for use in vehicles. In airplanes, the
high costs of such redundant systems are not so signiﬁcant when looked at in relation to
the high overall costs of the vehicle. For road vehicles, an analogous use of three-fold
redundant systems would entail three times the investment in development and three times
the amount of hardware compared to today’s systems in vehicles. It remains to be seen
whether threefold redundancy of the systems is really necessary in vehicles.
In air trafﬁc, the ﬂight paths are assigned by a central air trafﬁc control center and the
autopilots keep to these prescribed routes. Therefore an autopilot in an airplane can be
compared with a semi-automated driver’s assistance system, as the pilots have the duty of
monitoring the system. On unmanned airplanes, the monitoring by the pilot is omitted and
the requirements of the airplane guidance systems are greater. Risks are reduced by using
ﬂight paths that only ﬂy over sparsely populated areas. As there are no persons on board,
crashing into an empty ﬁeld is a possibility as nobody will be injured [34].

connection via a coupling in the event of a fault: http://www.newsroom.nissan-europe.com/de/de-de/

23.2.3 Robotics
Mobile robots can pose a danger to themselves and their surroundings due to collisions
with objects, persons and other living creatures and by overlooking ledges, ditches, steps,
etc. [1, 10, 18]. Automated manipulators that are either used on stationary or mobile
platforms can endanger people by moving their joints and colliding with the humans or by
injuring them with the tools they are using. Therefore, for both the mobile robot and the
manipulators, the safe state is the stopping of all manipulators in their current position or a
standstill [5]. In most cases the following applies: the faster this happens, the lesser the
danger that arises for the robot and its environment. Exceptions to this are tools and
manipulators such as hands and grabbers that can apply pressure. Stopping the actuators
could result in a pressure that can lead to injuries and damage. If a robot is used for
complex activities, injuries and damage could occur that are not directly caused by the
motion of the robot, but by the consequences of its actions. For example ﬁres may be
started if an ironing robot suddenly stopped moving or if hazardous goods were being
transported by a mobile robot [64].
In [64, 65], a safety-orientated architecture for robot control systems is presented that
contains a safety layer. This is intended to always transfer the robot to a safe state. The
safe states depend on the functions the robots are to fulﬁll. These can vary greatly and
therefore in [64, 65] safety policies are suggested that contain a hierarchical rule structure
that enables the safe operation of a robot. It is conceivable that a robot can ﬁnd an
unexpected solution—depending on its degree of autonomy and its inherent capabilities—
and this can result in dangerous situations. As described in [9], this can occur with the
frequently used subsumption architecture. In relation to autonomous vehicles, this means
that driving decisions can be taken according to different criteria such as trafﬁc law,
efﬁcient driving style and comfort, but a collision avoidance system that can take action as
the higher level authority would have to be active at all times.
23.2.4 Power Station Technology
Atomic power stations are largely regarded as a particular risk, as faults can lead to
signiﬁcant environmental damage. The control and regulation systems used there must
therefore fulﬁll the highest safety requirements in order to enable operation even after
natural catastrophes, terror attacks or internal technical faults. As immediate shut-down is
not possible with atomic power stations, and the combustion elements remain active and
require cooling even after their deployment in the reactor, many redundant systems are
required, particularly for cooling.
The safety of an atomic power station largely depends on the complete and fault-free
speciﬁcation and development of the control and monitoring systems. Integrating the
entirety of the possible situations and events plays an important role, as it is especially
chain reactions and multiple faults that can lead to hazards. For example, the Fukushima
482
A. Reschka
Daiichi atomic power station in Fukushima, Japan was in a fail-safe condition after the
earthquake and all safety systems were correctly automatically activated. However, after
the tsunami wave hit, parts of the redundant safety systems were damaged, in particular
the emergency power units. With hindsight, we can say that the error was not in the failure
of the safety functions, but instead lay in the incorrect speciﬁcations [63].
Therefore, for autonomous vehicles it can be said that the numerous events and
combinations of events and error sources must be taken into account in the speciﬁcations
stage. Possibly this will require a standardization of the requirements, comparable with
that for atomic power stations. When they are developed, safety plays an essential role in
the design phase and is the focus of the development process (safety by design, [26]).
23.3
Safe States in the Use Cases
One important criterion in the operation of an autonomous vehicle is whether there are
passengers on board or not. For example, when choosing a parking space, it is not
necessary to take the safe exit of passengers from the vehicle into account, however the
safety of other road users cannot be forgotten. In addition comfort plays no role, meaning
that a different driving style is possible in which comfort can be neglected. However, if
passengers are on board, the vehicle guidance system must take over the tasks of a human
driver. This also includes monitoring the passengers, for example if they are wearing their
safety belts and are sitting on the passengers’ seats or if they are acting in a dangerous
manner. Collisions with other road users can occur at any time and therefore passive
safety mechanisms such as safety belts and airbags are also necessary in autonomous
vehicles. The same applies to the securing of loads, especially hazardous goods.
The following section will investigate the four use cases deﬁned for the project and
examine the respective properties of the safe states.
23.3.1 Use Case 1: Interstate Pilot Using Driver
for Extended Availability
By restricting use to freeways, the number of possible and probable situations is lower
than compared to use in urban trafﬁc. The safety driver is basically present as a fallback
and is able to take control at any time and whenever he or she regards this as necessary.
The vehicle is in a safe state in the following situations:
1. The vehicle is standing still. A stationary vehicle poses no active or immediate danger
(see [6, 27]). However, the safety of passengers and other road users depends on the
location of the vehicle:
– Lane on a freeway: Due to the presence of a safety driver, continuing the journey
with manual control is very probably possible. If continuing the journey with
manual control is no longer possible, a stationary vehicle on a lane on a freeway
23
Safety Concept for Autonomous Vehicles
483
can become a dangerous situation as deﬁned in error codes F5 and F6 in [6] (see
Table 23.1). On the one hand the vehicle could be overlooked or seen too late, on
the other hand because the passengers may have to leave the vehicle. Another
danger can arise if the automated vehicle blocks a path for emergency vehicles in a
trafﬁc jam. If driving under manual control is no longer possible, the safety driver is
obliged to secure the vehicle in accordance with the pertinent legal requirements,
e.g. according to §15 StVO (German highway code) [11].
– Shoulders on a freeway or the curbside of a freeway where there is no shoulder,
parking lot emergency stop bay or other similar location: If an automated vehicle is
stranded on the shoulder of a freeway, at the curbside or another similar location, it
may be possible that the safety driver can continue driving under manual control or
he needs to secure the vehicle in accordance with the pertinent legal requirements
(see error codes F2, F3 and F4 in [6]).
2. The vehicle drives on a lane at either prescribed distance or at a greater distance due to
the vehicle’s performance to other road users and at least at the minimum prescribed
speed, respectively the highest permitted speed or the highest possible speed the
performance of the vehicle permits. The vehicle is aware of its own performance and
can therefore detect the limits of the system independently.
3. The vehicle guidance system reacts with an action (see Sect. 23.5) to an event (see
Sect. 23.4) to reduce the current risk. In this way a safe state should be attained or
maintained—for example, by handing over control to the safety driver.
23.3.2 Use Case 2: Autonomous Valet Parking
In this use case the maximum speed of the vehicle is only low [approx. 30 km/h (approx.
19 mph)]. This means that the resulting energy that would be required to brake in the
event of an emergency is considerably lower than the 50 km/h (approx. 31 mph) that is
permitted in urban areas in Germany. Transferring control to a safety driver is not possible
in this use case as the vehicle can be operated without a driver. The safety of passengers
plays no role as no passengers are on board when the vehicle is driving. The intended
route must be planned so that the vehicle does not drive on any roads that the vehicle does
not have command of, for example streets with level crossings.
The vehicle is in a safe operational state in the following situations:
1. The vehicle is at a standstill: The location of the stopped vehicle is relevant as the
vehicle could be a dangerous obstacle for other vehicles and block emergency vehicles
and emergency escape paths. Securing the stopped vehicle is more difﬁcult because no
human is on board to take over this task. It would appear that only the lighting on the
vehicle can be used to secure it. In many countries there are special regulations on
securing broken-down vehicles, for example a warning triangle that has to be set up
484
A. Reschka
several meters behind the vehicle. It is hard to imagine that this could be performed by
an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, one or more persons must be responsible for this.
The vehicle must either be constantly monitored or request help independently in the
event that it is forced to stop.
2. The vehicle is driving on a lane on the road as described in use case 1. However it is
not possible to transfer control to a safety driver as there is none on board. There is a
possibility of stopping the vehicle and attaining a safe state in this way. It is also
conceivable that in the event of a fault, control of the vehicle is transferred to a remote
operator who then drives the vehicle to a safe location by means of remote control.
3. The vehicle drives through a crossing or roundabout or turns off. If the vehicle has
command of the situation and the trafﬁc priority rules applicable to the situation, these
maneuvers are safe. If the vehicle reaches the limits of the system, it can continue
driving at a reduced speed while signaling to the other road users.
4. The vehicle is on a parking lot. The low relative speeds and the comparatively low
levels of trafﬁc mean that the requirements are lower here and the operating risk is also
lower.
The greatest challenge is the lack of a safety driver. In the case of events that increase
the risk, it is not possible to transfer control to a safety driver and a standstill can have
hidden risks in many situations as the vehicle cannot be moved immediately under manual
control. One solution could be the remote operator. This requires a communications
channel to the vehicle for reporting problems and for the remote control of the vehicle. If
stopping is required, this must be signaled accordingly to the other road users. Securing
the vehicle by the safety driver is not possible in this case.
Blocking emergency vehicle access and emergency escape paths on single-lane roads
and access points for emergency vehicles in front of buildings and other facilities is a
special case. Blockages can mean the emergency rescue actions are delayed or compli-
cated. On the one hand this is illegal, on the other it is a major ethical consideration. The
author is not aware of any investigations that show the frequency that such situations
occur. Therefore it is not possible to state whether this case needs to be explicitly taken
into consideration or not. Non-automated vehicles can also break down, however it is
simpler for the driver of the vehicle to drive or push the vehicle out of the way in a quick
and uncomplicated manner.
23.3.3 Use Case 3: Full Automation Using Driver
for Extended Availability
The safety and risks of this use case are very similar to a combination of use cases 1 and 2.
The presence of a safety driver means it is possible to hand over control. The driver can
also secure the vehicle should it break down.
23
Safety Concept for Autonomous Vehicles
485
The necessary driving maneuvers and situations are the same as this in use cases 1 and
2. In addition, the vehicle is also used on interstate connections. The maximum speed in
this use case is restricted to 240 km/h (approx. 149 mph). This means that practically
every speed is feasible, however the maximum speed must always be selected so that it is
within the performance capability of the vehicle guidance system and the risk is corre-
spondingly reduced.
In terms of the safe state, the same conditions apply as in use cases 1 and 2.
23.3.4 Use Case 4: Vehicle on Demand
In terms of (safety) technology, this use case is the most challenging. The vehicle must be
capable of handling every situation that a human might have to handle. The risk has to lie
below a threshold of risk that is reasonable for the passengers and other road users. Both
driving maneuvers and the conditions for the safe state can be taken from use cases 1, 2
and 3, taking into account that there is no safety driver.
The vehicle is in a safe state in the following conditions:
1. The vehicle is standing still as in use cases 1, 2 and 3. In each situation the vehicle
requires external help. In addition to potential passengers, other persons are involved
who have to be informed of the state of the vehicle and respond to vehicle problems.
2. The vehicle is driving on a trafﬁc lane as in use cases 1, 2 and 3. While driving, the
vehicle must be independently capable of maintaining or attaining a safe state.
Due to availability on demand and the universal usability, the vehicle on demand must
be capable of handling all trafﬁc situations. The safety-relevant events that require a
reaction from the vehicle are examined in greater detail in the next section.
23.3.5 Summary
Examining the four use cases has shown that the greatest challenges for the safe state are
posed by high relative speeds, the lack of a safety driver and blocking of emergency
vehicle access routes and emergency escape paths. Examining these aspects allows the
safety requirements for the vehicle to be derived:
– An autonomous vehicle must be aware of its current performance capabilities.
– An autonomous vehicle must be aware of its current functional limits in relation to the
current situation.
– An autonomous vehicle must always be operated in a condition in which the level of
risk is reasonable for the passengers and other road users.
– A vehicle that is standing on the shoulder or by the curbside and is not blocking trafﬁc
is in a safe state.
486
A. Reschka
– A vehicle that is standing on a trafﬁc lane is only in a safe state if all of the following
conditions are met:
• The relative speed to other road users is below a maximum still to be deﬁned.
• The stationary vehicle is not blocking emergency vehicle access routes or emer-
gency escape paths.
• A safety driver or remote operator can remove the vehicle from this location within
a short time.
• A safety driver can secure the vehicle.
– A vehicle moving with a high level of risk or one that has come to a standstill at a
dangerous location must be capable of sending an emergency signal and requesting
help.
23.4
Safety-Relevant Events
Various events can occur in road trafﬁc that affect the risk in the current situation and in
the future development of the situation. On the one hand, technical defects and faults in
the vehicle guidance system reduce its performance capacity and on the other hand
changes to environmental conditions, situations that overtax the vehicle guidance system,
incorrect behavior of other road users and acts of force majeure all increase the require-
ments of the vehicle guidance system. In particular a combination of reduced capabilities
and the increased demands can lead to higher levels of risk.
Defects and technical faults on the vehicle and in the vehicle guidance system can
occur suddenly and are therefore very difﬁcult to foresee. In addition to mechanical
defects on the vehicle, defects and development errors in the vehicle guidance system can
result in a reduced performance capacity (see [16]). Adverse light and weather conditions
increase the requirements of the durability of the sensors used to detect the surroundings.
In addition, adverse weather conditions lead to worse road conditions. These directly
affect driving dynamics. Due to the complexity of road trafﬁc and the endless quantity of
possible situations, it is probable that not all situations will be taken into account when
developing a vehicle guidance system. If the vehicle encounters a situation that cannot be
resolved with the existing software, this has a direct inﬂuence on the risk level.
Recognizing the ability of the vehicle and the limits of the system is a great challenge
in such situations. The behavior of other road users does not always conform to the rules
and it may occur that they behave in a dangerous manner. In some situations, operation of
an automated vehicle can never be safe because other road users act in a dangerous
manner. It is conceivable that this may even occur deliberately if an automated vehicle is
recognized as such. Force majeure can also pose a higher risk to operation, for example
due to earthquakes or ﬂash ﬂooding or solar bursts that result in interference to the
systems used such as a global satellite navigation system or vehicle-to-vehicle
23
Safety Concept for Autonomous Vehicles
487
communication [12]. Such events are not taken into consideration when developing
driving assistance systems in accordance with ISO 26262 [30]. How they will be handled
in autonomous vehicles remains open [61].
23.5
Measures for Reducing Risk Levels
Assuming that an autonomous vehicle is always to be operated with an acceptable level of
risk and at the same time should have as wide a functional scope as possible, actions are to
be performed as a reaction to safety-relevant events that reduce the risk to an acceptable
level or retain this level and simultaneously enable a higher scope of functionality. A re-
duction of driving speed, an increase in distance to the vehicles in the vicinity,
safety-optimized planning of driving maneuvers, prohibition of certain driving maneuvers,
and the execution of safety maneuvers are all possible. The underlying principle of
graceful degradation comes from the ﬁeld of biology and was presented in [40]. In [68],
among other things, there is an overview of the applications of graceful degradation in
aerospace technology, power station technology and other research areas. If errors occur
in one system or if resources are limited, the vital processes are maintained and other less
important processes are scaled back or ended. For example, if the ﬁeld of vision is
restricted, the speed of the vehicle can be reduced. However, in certain conditions, even
the execution of these actions cannot reduce the risk to an acceptable level, meaning that
stopping the vehicle becomes necessary [25, 46], or if this is too risky, leaving the trafﬁc
ﬂow.
With graceful degradation, it is not only necessary to attain or maintain a safe state but
also to improve performance by using mechanisms for self-repair and reconﬁguration. In
technical systems restarting components is a widely-used measure for restoring perfor-
mance [22, 44]. Restarting needs time and, depending on the system structure, it can occur
that restarting a component also means restarting or at least re-initialization of other
components. Therefore safety-critical components often have (diverse) redundant designs
(see [3, 28]).
In addition to redundancy there is also the possibility of restoring functionality for
individual components. Sensors and actuators can be re-calibrated to improve their
measured values or set-points can be implemented depending on the current situation.
Reconﬁguration mechanisms can be used for the overall system that enable safe operation
even after risk-increasing events [33].
Recognizing risky situations is a challenge. External events must be detected and
correctly interpreted by the environmental monitoring system. Technical faults on the
vehicle and in the vehicle guidance system must also be detected. A driver uses his or her
senses to observe warning and monitoring lamps and notices changes in the vehicle, for
example due to technical defects. An autonomous vehicle must therefore integrate sensors
and functions that detect faults and errors and determine the future performance level and
possible scope of function on the basis of the severity of these faults and errors. The
488
A. Reschka
complexity to be expected of a vehicle with a vehicle guidance system will lead to a large
number of measured values. As a result, a self-representation of the vehicle will be created
that will be used to create an evaluation of the current risk that depends on the situation
and the performance capability. The so-called safety actions are performed on the basis of
this evaluation [46].
23.6
Anticipation of Degradation Situations
Due to the highly dynamic nature of road trafﬁc and the properties of electric and elec-
tronic systems, safety-relevant events can occur in a fraction of a second and therefore
require a fast response from the system. However, it is better if situations in which high
levels of risk are present can be foreseen or at least taken into consideration when
planning driving maneuvers. Anticipatory driving by humans can be implemented in an
even more wide-ranging manner in a vehicle guidance system as the monitoring and
application of numerous measured values is performed directly from the vehicle.
All of the collected measured value data must be monitored and stored to predict how
situations will develop. The broad scope of the data analysis could allow incipient errors
to be detected. Even detecting difﬁculties a few tenths of a second before the event can
lead to a safer reaction. A necessary braking maneuver that has been detected and trig-
gered 0.3 s earlier can shorten the stopping distance by 4.2 m at a speed of 50 km/h
(approx. 31 mph).
Communications with the infrastructure and other vehicles yields further potential for
increasing safety. The sooner information on hazards is available, for example road
surface damage, dirt and ice, trafﬁc jams ahead or emergency brake maneuvers of vehicles
ahead on the road, the sooner a response to these can be initiated.
23.7
Dilemmas
In some cases, a chain of events can lead to a situation that cannot be resolved without
personal injuries. When faced with a dilemma, an automated vehicle must select a possible
course of action, which even though it will result in personal injuries, will cause the
minimum amount of damage. Material damage and road trafﬁc law infringements are also
possible, however these have lower priority. The number of passengers on board and the
type and dynamics of other road users must be taken into account in the evaluation of
possible uncertainties. Communication with other road users is particularly important here
and can help to resolve such situations with the minimum amount of personal injuries.5

Vehicles] will research this ﬁeld in the coming years: http://www.dfg.de/foerderung/info_

A detailed ethical discussion of dilemmas can be found in Chap. 4 of this book. Therefore,
the following section will solely focus on the technical aspects of dilemma situations.
Figure 23.1 shows two situations. The ﬁrst can be resolved without a collision. The
second can lead to a dilemma. At the start of the ﬁrst situation, the vehicle is driving on a
road lane and other vehicles are parked by the side of the road. Unexpectedly a person,
who is barely discernible, steps between the parked cars and onto the road. The vehicle
can respond in several different ways to avoid a collision with the pedestrian. Option 1:
The vehicle can brake and stop before hitting the pedestrian. Option 2: The vehicle can
switch to the neighboring road lane and thus avoid a collision. However, this requires
crossing a continuous line between the road lanes. This would infringe road trafﬁc law.

A. Reschka
In the second situation a vehicle is driving in the oncoming direction on the second
road lane. If one assumes that a braking maneuver will no longer prevent a collision with
the pedestrian, the autonomous vehicle is facing a dilemma:
Colliding with the pedestrian could result in serious injuries to the pedestrian (option 2).
Switching to the neighboring lane will result in a collision with the oncoming vehicle and
possibly also result in injuries to the pedestrian (option 3). A collision with the parked
vehicles to reduce the vehicle’s own speed is also feasible (option 4), however it would
remain highly uncertain as to whether the pedestrian would emerge uninjured from the
situation. In such situations the decision-taking software within the vehicle guidance
system will have to be programmed with ethical principles.
Vehicle-to-vehicle communication between the autonomous and oncoming vehicle
could solve at least this problem. The two vehicles could ﬁnd a solution together. The
oncoming vehicle could switch to the edge of the lane so that the autonomous vehicle can
pass between the oncoming vehicle and the pedestrian without a collision occurring
(option 5). Both vehicles would infringe road trafﬁc law in this situation as both must
cross a continuous line.
However, operation without communications with other road users and the infras-
tructure must also be possible as it is unlikely that these communication options will be
available everywhere and for all road users.
Vehicle guidance must therefore be possible with the on-board sensors. This on-board
autonomous operation (see [36]) makes the highest requirements of the vehicle guidance
system on the one hand and on the other hand is also currently the only possible option for
use in road trafﬁc. This restricts options, especially in situations involving danger and
dilemmas and increases the uncertainty in perceiving situations. Signalization to other
road users is only possible in an optical and acoustic manner.
23.8
Summary
In the current state of development of driving assistance systems and related research and
development areas, there are a wide variety of methods that could and possibly must be
used in the development of autonomous vehicles. The wide range of technology means
that these systems affect different areas of the development process and the system to be
developed and also that they can contribute to the safety of autonomous vehicles.
First a metric must be found with which the operating risk of autonomous vehicles can
be evaluated and then a generally acceptable risk threshold must be deﬁned. The proce-
dure used in power station development for determining the safety requirements and
integrating functional safety in the overall system could be useful in this area.
In terms of the functional safety of the regulation of actuators, examples form aero-
nautics and aerospace and partially rail travel can be used in the current research and
development of vehicle technology. Multiple, diverse redundancy is one of the most
promising means. The same applies for software components for situation analysis,
23
Safety Concept for Autonomous Vehicles
491
decision-making and motion planning. Until now only the ﬁeld of robotics has been faced
with similarly complex situations. However, the level of risk there is mostly lower.
One of the biggest challenges is the reliability and dependability of environment
perception systems that also include self-perception and situation perception. Due to the
inﬁnite quantity of possible situations, as far as the author is aware, it has not yet been
possible to implement complex applications—as described in the use cases—in a safe
manner. This will also require hardware, software and functional redundancies, for
example in the composition of the sensors for perceiving the immediate environment.
A safety driver is still required in research projects for autonomous vehicles. This
person monitors the system and can either take action directly or use remote emergency
stop functions or an emergency stop switch. The research projects considered currently
focus heavily on functions and less on their functional safety.
The safety of autonomous vehicles is one of the basic challenges of future research.
The development of the technology not only requires the resolution of technical problems,
but also legal and social problems. A large proportion of these will be discussed and
examined in the later chapters of this book.

Opportunities and Risks Associated
with Collecting and Making Usable
Additional Data
Kai Rannenberg
Abstract
Cars have for a long time been a symbol for the freedom and autonomy of their users.
Now autonomous driving raises the question how the data ﬂows related to autonomous
driving inﬂuence the privacy of these cars’ users. Therefore this chapter discusses ﬁve
guiding questions on autonomous driving, data ﬂows, and the privacy impact of
vehicles interacting with other entities: (1) Which “new” or additional data are being
collected and processed due to autonomous driving and which consequences result
from those “new” or additional data being collected and processed? (Sect. 24.2);
(2) Are certain types of data special and do they cause special hindrances? (Sect. 24.3);
(3) What is required from the perspective of privacy? (Sect. 24.4); (4) When building
architectures, what needs to be kept in mind to avoid creating difﬁcult or even
unsolvable privacy problems? (Sect. 24.5); (5) What needs to be considered in the long
term? (Sect. 24.6). The questions will be discussed relating as much as possible to the
case studies that were introduced at the beginning of this book. Sect. 24.7 concludes
this text including an analysis whether more autonomy of driving vehicles leads to
more privacy problems.

24.1
Introduction: Cars, Freedom, and Privacy
Cars have for a long time been a symbol for the freedom and autonomy of their users, be it
drivers or passengers: Car drivers can decide on their own, where to drive, which route to
choose and often even how fast to travel (or at least when to take a break), and they don’t
need to report this to anybody. Many pieces of art reﬂect the opportunity for freedom and
escape from (often undue) control that cars offer to their users. Some of the most
impressive examples may be episodes 3, 4, 6, and 7 of the 1947 movie “In those days” [1],
which describe the more or less successful car journeys of several people oppressed by the
German Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945; other examples can be mentioned also
(Chap. 3). At the same time, a car offers its driver and holder a protected sphere of
privacy: People from outside usually don’t hear what is communicated in a car and they
cannot easily take a seat and join the conversation. “My car is my castle” is not as popular
as “my home is my castle”; still many people see their car as the extension of their home;
correspondingly many household goods and activities can be viewed in a car ([2], para-
graph 2).
If one takes this perspective, autonomous cars could be just an extension of the tra-
ditional concepts of freedom, autonomy, and privacy for their drivers and users. However,
“autonomous driving” in ﬁrst instance makes the driving more autonomous from the
drivers. At the same time, it relies much more on interaction with the outside world than a
human-driven car. Autonomous cars sense their environment and often even communicate
with that environment, e.g. cars nearby. Beyond that exchange with near-by entities, there
are plans to control and synchronize cars with trafﬁc centers to optimize their behavior,
e.g. their choice of a route. Like any other centralized entity collecting data, this raises
privacy concerns, and motivates an analysis of the data ﬂows and the corresponding
privacy impact. The situation is more critical if one considers that cars not only can collect
a lot of data on their users and the environment, but also store them for a long time and
then communicate them to other entities.
Therefore this chapter follows ﬁve guiding questions on autonomous driving, data
ﬂows, and the privacy impact of vehicles interacting with other entities:
1. Which “new” or additional data are being collected and processed due to autonomous
driving, and which consequences result from those “new” or additional data being
collected and processed? (Sect. 24.2)
2. Are certain types of data special and do they cause special hindrances? (Sect. 24.3)
3. What is required from the perspective of privacy? (Sect. 24.4)
4. When building architectures, what needs to be kept in mind to avoid creating difﬁcult
or even unsolvable privacy problems? (Sect. 24.5)
5. What needs to be considered in the long term? (Sect. 24.6).
The questions will be discussed relating as much as possible to the use cases that were
introduced at the beginning of this book. Section 24.7 concludes this chapter.

24.2
Additional Data Collected and Processed due
to Autonomous Driving
To assess the opportunities and risks associated with collecting additional data and
making it usable, it is useful to ﬁrst try to identify those data. This will be done along the
four use cases deﬁned in Chap. 2, but ﬁrst a short overview on data that is being collected
or may be collected in a non-autonomous car will be given.
24.2.1 Personal Data Collected and Potentially Transmitted
in Today’s Networked Cars
While the analysis in this chapter will concentrate on “new” or additional data, it should
be mentioned here, that quite a few sensitive personal data are already collected in today’s
cars and sometimes even transmitted. Some examples are
• All types of location data and navigational data: Typical data are destination, travel
time, travel habits (“every weekend to Stuttgart”) and preferences for routing (scenic
vs. fast vs. ecologically friendly vs. on the edge of legality). Especially when a car is
tracked by a dispatching system, a theft control system, a car insurance system, or a
road pricing system, a lot of information is collected about its whereabouts and in
many cases transferred to the related central entities. Some of these systems store data
in decentralized fashion due to their sensitivity, but others don’t. An example that
became quite prominent recently is the new European eCall system [3–5]: eCall is
activated automatically as soon as in-vehicle sensors detect a serious crash. Once set
off, the system dials the European emergency number 112, establishes a telephone link
to an emergency call center and sends details of the accident to the rescue services,
including the time of incident, the accurate position of the crashed vehicle and the
direction of travel (most important on motorways and in tunnels). An eCall can also be
triggered manually by pushing a button in the car, for example by a witness to a
serious accident.
• Data on driving dynamics: This type of data, for instance on acceleration, gives
information on the behavior of the car but also on the behavior of the driver, such as
the driving style (e.g. calm vs. aggressive vs. fast vs. on the edge of legality).
• Data on driving behavior: These data can be derived from location data over time. For
example, comparing the location of a car on a highway with the location 15 min before
may tell about the average speed of the car and whether a speed limit was violated or
possibly violated.
• The environment: The car may be collecting data from the environment to document
the ride or speciﬁc trafﬁc situations in case such documentation would be considered
helpful later. Examples include dashboard cameras to document and maybe transmit
24
Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making …

what is happening in front of the car. Data from the environment may well be other
people’s personal data, e.g. number plates of other vehicles or faces of people.
This rough overview also raises the question: What kinds of data are actually personal?
Some of the data listed may not seem to be “personal”. However, experience over years of
initiatives aimed at privacy protection has shown that there are no guarantees that data
cannot be related to persons and cannot be misused. One consequence of this lesson is that
“personally identiﬁable information (PII)” is nowadays not only the information that
directly identiﬁes a person, but “any information that (a) can be used to identify the PII
principal to whom such information relates, or (b) is or might be directly or indirectly
linked to a PII principal” ([8], clause 2.9).1 The PII principal ([8], clause 2.11) is then the
individual whose data are being processed. In our cases, PII principals may include
drivers, passengers, or car owners, but also passersby who are sensed and can be identiﬁed
in any way.
Still, the fact remains that the practical sensitivity of data at a certain point in time
depends a lot on context, e.g. the location information of a car may be more sensitive if the
car is parked near a red-light district. More examples will be seen in the discussion of the
use cases of autonomous driving and the related interests of the parties involved. More-
over, analyzing the cases helps to illustrate new situations and the respective issues.
24.2.2 Personal Data Collected in Autonomous Cars
This section discusses the data collection in autonomous cars along the four cases as
introduced in the beginning of this book (Chap. 2).
24.2.2.1
Use Case 1: Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability
The driving robot takes over the driving task, but only on interstates or interstate-like
expressways. During autonomous journeys, drivers become passengers who can take their
hands off the steering wheel and feet off the pedals and pursue other activities. The driving
robot coordinates a safe handover to the driver and may even stop the car at a safe place if
needed.
1The relation between data and information is too subtle and too complex to be sufﬁciently
explained within the limits of this chapter. All the same, considering data and information as roughly
equivalent should sufﬁce for the purpose of this chapter. Using only one term would put the paper at
odds with some of the referenced literature.
500
K. Rannenberg
The new and additional data the car can collect and learn in this case are data on:
• Driver capabilities, e.g. whether the driver is able to take back control from the robot
or not, and how much time such a take-back-operation takes: Both types of data may
be of interest as up-to-date data for immediate reaction but also as a basis for longi-
tudinal evaluations.
• Driving behavior: On top of other data on driving behavior that are already available
nowadays, this case enables the collection of additional data, i.e. under which cir-
cumstances the driver delegates control and/or demands it back.
• The environment: Additional data from the environment can be collected to pursue the
autonomous ride. Also, documenting the ride or speciﬁc trafﬁc situations may be
considered helpful to handle potential conﬂicts. As in Sect. 24.2.1, data from the
environment may well be the personal data of other people, e.g. number plates of
vehicles or people’s faces. So environmental data contain a mix of personal data of
several people, which makes them especially delicate.
Following the discussion on the legal and liability implications of autonomous driving
(see the part of this book on law and liability (Part V) one can indeed assume that there
will be an interest in collecting data to document potential accidents and investigate what
behavior of the car, the robot, the driver, or other parties may have caused the accidents.
This would accord with other cases of law enforcement agencies having a large “appetite”
for data that may become available through the computerization of an activity, as com-
puterized activities are usually easy to log in computerized logs.
24.2.2.2
Use Case 2: Autonomous Valet Parking
The driving robot parks the vehicle at a nearby or remote location after the users have
exited and cargo has been unloaded. The driving robot drives the vehicle from the parking
location to a desired destination. The driving robot re-parks the vehicle. The driver saves
the time of ﬁnding a parking spot as well as of walking to/from a remote parking spot. In
addition, access to the vehicle is eased (spatially and temporally). Additional parking
space is used more efﬁciently and search for parking is arranged more efﬁciently.
The new and additional data the car can collect and learn in this case are data on:
• The duration of a stay: How much time do users spend at their destination?
• The area of interest: Where do the users spend more or less time?
• Times of travel and duration of gaps in between: When do users spend more or less
time leaving the car alone (e.g. always at Saturday night there is a ride to somewhere
and then a long break of more than 8 h)?
• Under which circumstances is the car left alone?
24
Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making …
501
• Visiting habits: How often does the user go where? For example, “every weekend to a
certain supermarket, bar, or discotheque.”
• The environment: These data may in principle be the same as in Use Case 1, but
depending on the environment, there may be different data. Driving through a parking
lot the car may “catch” more number plates than on a highway, but fewer people (and
faces) in the cars. However, on the way to the parking lot there may be more
pedestrians, e.g. crossing the streets, so more faces to recognize.
As there is no direct interaction between the driver and the car, no data on driving
behavior are collected.
24.2.2.3
Use Case 3: Full Automation Using Driver for Extended
Availability
Use Case 3 is similar to Use Case 1, as in both cases the driving robot performs the
driving task with drivers just being passengers who can take their hands off the steering
wheel and their feet off the pedals and pursue other activities. However, in Use Case 3 the
driver can delegate the driving task to the driving robot in many permitted areas, not just
expressways. So the new and additional data the car can collect and learn are basically the
same as in Use Case 1, but there may be more options for the driver to delegate and take
back control. This can lead to more data being available on driver behavior, especially in
circumstances where the driver delegates control and/or takes it back. Similarly to Use
Case 2, the data on the environment may be richer and more sensitive than the data
collected on a highway described in Use Case 1.
24.2.2.4
Use Case 4: Vehicle on Demand
The driving robot drives the vehicle autonomously in all scenarios with occupants and/or
cargo, but also completely without any payload. The driving robot makes the vehicle
available at any requested location. Passengers use the travel time completely indepen-
dently for activities other than performing the driving task. The cabin design is completely
free of any requirements for any driver workplace whatsoever, but it may have a camera
directed at the passenger space.
While this case is the most demanding from the perspective of autonomous driving,
there may be less additional data collected than in Use Case 3. In particular, there is no
additional data collected on driving behavior, as there is no driver in the loop anymore.
The additional data collected are:
• Travel behavior (e.g., when do passengers want to take breaks?)
• General behavior (or misbehavior) of all passengers in the car
• Data collected on the environment, e.g. to document an accident and what may have
caused it (if data on passengers are considered useful for accident documentation).

24.2.3 Consequences for Control Over Data and Misuse Resulting
from Data Storage
In principle, the storage of any kind of data opens possibilities for any kind of processing
that would not exist without that storage. While this seems to be a theoretical triviality, the
practical consequences of storing data are that they can be used and misused later, maybe
under circumstances of which the user was not originally aware. This implies a
longer-term responsibility for these data. The responsibility has to lie with the body that
can control the data and make decisions about their usage.
If one can assume that the data stored in a car are under the sole control of the car’s
owner or driver, then determining responsibility for these data may be relatively easy.
Otherwise, the responsibility for storage and any kind of misuse would expand to the body
that controls the storage or transfer or both. This only applies, however, if the data can
leave the car and the domain of its owner without the owner being in control of this data
transfer.
There are at least two indications that powerful bodies will ask for data stored in a car
to be transmitted out of the car:
1. Law enforcement agencies very often take the approach that data stored for any
technical or commercial purpose should also be made available for law enforcement
purposes. Lawmakers have often followed this position. The example closest to cars
and location data is that of mobile phone communication. From the beginning of the
1990s, the GSM standard for cell-based mobile communication has been established
and the location information of subscribers processed in the networks. Rules were soon
established to enable law enforcement agencies to access all types of data in the GSM
networks,
including
location
data:
an
example
is
the
German
Fern-
meldeüberwachungsverordnung [6], which was established as early as 1995.
2. Internet enterprises such as Google are inspired and driven by connectivity and
transmitting data. An example is a statement of Jared Cohen, Director of Google Ideas
and Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google in the conclusions of their joint book
“The New Digital Age” [7], p. 254: “Attempts to contain the spread of connectivity or
curtail people’s access will always fail over a long enough period of time–information,
like water, will always ﬁnd its way through.”
Not everything that these powerful organizations have been asking for has happened,
but the examples give an impression of the challenges accompanying data storage, even in
a contained fashion.
24.2.4 Consequences from Data Transfer to Third Parties
Data being transferred to entities outside of the domain of the car owner or driver (third
parties) can enable those entities to pursue their interests. These interests may or may not
24
Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making …
503
conform to the interests of the parties identiﬁed by the data (also called data subjects),
typically the driver or the owner of the car. This section will give examples of the
following third parties: vehicle manufacturers, insurance services, ﬂeet operators,
government-authorized parties, peer ad-hoc networks, e.g. other trafﬁc entities or other
autonomous vehicles, and trafﬁc centers. This sequence of sections follows the rising
complexity in the setting of the third party entities.
24.2.4.1
Vehicle Manufacturers
Vehicle manufacturers may be interested in documenting vehicle behavior, e.g. to learn
about the vehicle’s behavior in extreme situations and about the quality of their (often
very complex) software, and to improve the systems. These data are similar to the kind of
data that manufacturers and operators of telecommunication systems collect for quality
assurance and maintenance purposes. At the same time, these data also deliver sensitive
information about the driver, e.g. the typical driving speed and the number of emergency
brakes or missed handovers from the driving robot in Use Cases 1 and 3.
24.2.4.2
Insurance Services
Insurance services are often interested in more information about their customers to assess
the level of risk associated with them or gain other customer insight. Depending on the
type of insurance, different information can be of interest, e.g. the insurance risk for an
accident can be derived from driving behavior (risk averse or less risk averse driving
style), and from location information for theft insurance (regions with more or less theft
risk for the speciﬁc vehicle). All cases offer rich data here, Use Cases 1 and 3 more on
driver behavior, all cases on location information, Use Case 4 also on occupants’ behavior
and emergency calls. These assessments may be fairer to insurance customers, as they
award cost-reducing behavior, but they put users under more surveillance without a clear
description of the related risks and opportunities. Often insurance services make decisions
based on scoring systems or details unknown to customers, as these details are considered
“trade secrets” the insurance companies wish kept conﬁdential to protect themselves in a
competitive market. Customers may then be surprised about decisions, e.g. the denial of
an upgraded contract or a fee raise.
24.2.4.3
Fleet Operators
Fleet operators such as rental car companies are in a situation similar to that of insurance
companies. To raise their commercial success, they try to assess the risk associated with
handing out a car to a certain customer and to consider the results of their assessments for
their pricing. Therefore the consequences for customers are also similar to those in the
case of insurances, e.g. with regard to (non)-extensions of contracts or fee rises. Also for
this scenario, all use cases offer data. A major difference to the case of insurance com-
panies is the fact that ﬂeet operators usually own the cars, so they have more control over
the cars than an insurance company has over an insured car. This difference is important
for any concept of a “private data vault” to store sensitive data of rental customers or
504
K. Rannenberg
drivers (see Sect. 24.5). In the ﬂeet-operator scenario, such a “private data vault” would
either need to be specially installed within the car to protect it from access by the ﬂeet
operator or it would need to be brought along by the rental customer or driver.
24.2.4.4
Commercial Location-Based Services
Advertisers are interested in directing the right messages to their respective target groups.
This may include placing advertisements at the right location, e.g. special offers of shops
near the next exit, encouraging commuters in a trafﬁc jam to leave the highway and go
shopping. Also, travelers in a trafﬁc jam on the way to a major airport can be targeted with
offers from a smaller regional airport (as seen, for instance, on the highway north towards
San Francisco airport, where ﬂights starting from San Jose have been advertised).
Advertisers are thus interested in trafﬁc ﬂows (and jams). Moreover, they always like to
know more details about their target groups, so any kind of behavior that allows con-
clusions, e.g. on the type of traveler (business, commuting, leisure) will be welcome.
24.2.4.5
Government-Authorized Parties
Government-authorized parties such as police forces or intelligence agencies can use the
data for surveillance to detect behavior they want to sanction or prevent. In the case of the
trafﬁc police, this can be any kind of behavior deemed unsafe or in violation of trafﬁc
laws, e.g. difﬁculties or strange behavior in interaction with the driving robot. Polices
forces investigating crimes or aiming to prevent crimes as well as intelligence agencies
may be interested in analyzing navigation and movement data to learn about the social
networks of travelers, e.g. who may meet whom where. There is also the strong potential
that the interested government and intelligence agencies have their very own interpretation
of what they are authorized to do beyond the assurances and guarantees of privacy laws
and privacy protection. This may especially hold for data on the environment the car
would be collecting. Having many or all cars collecting data from the environment can be
considered a speciﬁc form of crowd-sourcing. Some municipalities are considering
crowd-sourcing to collect pollution data. This may collect fewer or no personal data from
the environment, but conceptually it is not too far from a car spying on its environment.
24.2.4.6
Peer Ad-Hoc Networks
Peer ad-hoc networks (e.g. other trafﬁc entities or other autonomous vehicles) can be
interested in any kind of data used or analyzed by a speciﬁc car to optimize path tracking
and stabilization or which results from the optimization process. This data may help the
peer ad-hoc networks to assess the road conditions other vehicles are experiencing
especially at locations that are touched by their own routes. If the data are anonymized and
stay with the involved peers, the consequences are less severe than data transfer to
(central) entities aggregating data like the other entities discussed in this chapter.

505
24.2.4.7
Traffic Control Centers
Trafﬁc control centers’ interests depend a lot on the interests of their operators and owners.
Control centers aiming for efﬁcient trafﬁc ﬂows, and to mitigate the effects of accidents on
trafﬁc ﬂows, are interested in any kind of data that help them to assess current and future
trafﬁc situations: Driving conditions can be derived from environmental information or
from the assessments of driving behavior as delivered in all cases; potential congestion
can be derived from travel plans and navigational data. The other aims of these centers
may include collaborations with other entities to reﬁnance their costs or even deliver a
proﬁt to their owners or operators. This is helped by the fact that the other entities
discussed earlier in this section can make use of the data collected by trafﬁc centers.
The degree to which trafﬁc control centers would be interested in collaborating with
other entities interested in their data, and offer some reimbursement, may well depend on
their status and ﬁnancial situation. A private for-proﬁt control center would need to ﬁnd
funding; a public trafﬁc center may be under less pressure here. However, for many recent
major investments in public infrastructures, there were aims to operate them as
public-private partnerships to mitigate the lack of public money for investments. This
holds for toll-fee collection and was also the plan (though not a successful one) for the
Galileo satellite network. Also, public broadcasting companies are becoming more and
more dependent on private co-funding, e.g. from advertisements.
24.3
Are Certain Types of Data Special and Do They Create
Particular Obstacles?
It is extremely difﬁcult to predict the potential use of data for legitimate or illegitimate
purposes, and it has proven impossible to guarantee that no kind of data would be used or
misused, even in the long run. One reason is that, with today’s connectivity, combining
data is easy. Data on the agility a driver shows when taking back control from a driving
robot may look harmless, but if put in relation to the same data 10 years before or hence,
they can give the impression of driving abilities tending to rise or fall. This may put the
driver at an unfair disadvantage, e.g. when insurance fees are calculated. Similar scoring
activities by credit rating agencies have shown to be often very wrong with regard to an
individual, even if they may have a statistical value. Therefore there are no explicit rules to
consider certain data special and have special hindrances for their usage. One can get the
feeling that data allowing conclusions on to be drawn people’s health and/or (political)
views are especially sensitive, but there are no clear indications that these are always more
sensitive than data on their ﬁnancial situation, for example.
The legal consequence of this difﬁculty is the principle of asking for the processing of
each and every piece of data to be authorized, instead of giving general clearances (see
also the descriptions of “Purpose legitimacy and speciﬁcation” and “Collection limitation”
in Sect. 24.4.1). All data thus needs to be checked: Are they absolutely necessary to
506
K. Rannenberg
provide the service for which they have been collected? Was that type of processing
appropriate?
24.4
Requirements from the Perspective of Privacy
This section discusses the requirements from a privacy perspective, starting with an
introduction of internationally established principles and their relation to the use cases
(Sect. 24.4.1). Then additional surveillance measures for a “data-protected” usage of the
additional data are discussed in Sect. 24.4.2, before Sect. 24.4.3 focuses on limiting access
rights and on encryption.
24.4.1 Principles
For any personal data collected and transmitted beyond the domain of the data subject,
there must be a clear justiﬁcation with regard to relevant privacy principles and related
requirements. Privacy principles and requirements depend on the respective national,
regional and sometimes sector-speciﬁc legislation, so a complete analysis would be
impossible. Fortunately there is now the international standard ISO/IEC 29100 Privacy
Framework that was completed in 2011 and lists eleven privacy principles [8]. These
privacy principles were derived from existing principles developed by states, countries
and international organizations, e.g. the OECD and the EU. The editors came from
Germany and the USA, and experts from many countries participated intensively in the
development. One focus of the ISO/IEC 29100 Privacy Framework is the implementation
of the privacy principles in ICT (Information and Communications Technology) systems;
another is on developing privacy management systems within organizations’ ICT systems.
The privacy principles aim at guiding the design, development, and implementation of
privacy policies and privacy controls. A sketch of related requirements can also be found
in a recent recommendation of the very inﬂuential “Deutscher Verkehrsgerichtstag,” an
annual conference of legal experts focused on trafﬁc regulation [9]. The eleven principles
are:
1. Consent and choice
2. Purpose legitimacy and speciﬁcation
3. Collection limitation
4. Data minimization
5. Use, retention and disclosure limitation
6. Accuracy and quality
7. Openness, transparency and notice
8. Individual participation and access
24
Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making …
507
9. Accountability
10. Information security
11. Privacy compliance
This section will concentrate on explaining the principles considered most important
and give some examples from the use cases2:
• Consent and choice: The Consent principle was introduced over time to ensure that PII
(personally identiﬁable information) principals can control whether or not their PII is
being processed except where applicable law speciﬁcally allows the processing of PII
without consent. It is explicitly mentioned that consent needs to be informed consent,
so PII principals are to be informed about what they agree to, and it also needs to be
opt-in consent. It turned out that demanding appropriate choice became important to
avoid users giving de facto consent, as they have no alternative to get the respective
service. In Use Cases 1, 2 and 3, consent will be needed from the owner, the driver and
any identiﬁed passenger. In Use Case 4, passengers’ and, if applicable, drivers’ con-
sent is required. The most critical question, however, arises around consent for
scanned environmental data. For example, private observation cameras are usually not
allowed when they cover public space and can collect data from people there. For data
from public observation cameras there are strict rulings that follow the following
principles.
• Purpose legitimacy and speciﬁcation: Adhering to this principle means: ensuring that
any purposes comply with applicable law and rely on a permissible legal basis;
communicating any purpose to the PII principal before the information is collected or
used for a new purpose; using language for this speciﬁcation which is clear and
appropriately adapted to the circumstances; and, if applicable, giving sufﬁcient
explanations for the need to process sensitive PII. A purpose can require a legal basis
or a speciﬁc authorization by a data protection authority or a government authority. If
the purposes for processing PII do not conform to applicable law, processing should
not take place. For all use cases this means especially that the purposes need to be
speciﬁed explicitly and in a clear way. This will be a special challenge for the scanning
of environmental data.
• Collection limitation: The collection of PII is to be limited within the bounds of
applicable law and those data that are strictly necessary for the speciﬁed purpose(s). In
our use cases, this applies especially to any data on the behavior of any driver and
identiﬁed passenger. If the purpose is autonomous driving, any data collection will
need to be justiﬁed in relation to autonomous driving (and not any other use, even if,
for example, it seems commercially attractive).
• Data minimization: Data minimization is closely linked to collection limitation, but
refers to strictly minimizing the processing of PII. Data processing procedures and ICT
systems are to minimize the PII processed and access to it. Default options should,
2ISO/IEC 29100 has more extensive explanations of the principles.
508
K. Rannenberg
wherever possible, not involve the identiﬁcation of PII principals, reduce the
observability of their behavior, and limit the linkability of the PII collected with other
PII (and thereby also the traceability of the PII principal). Moreover, one should delete
and dispose of PII whenever the purpose for PII processing has expired, there are no
legal requirements to keep the PII, or whenever it is practical to do so. For all four use
cases, this principle limits the transfer of any data to any central entities, such as trafﬁc
control centers: PII that is only needed to manage the situation in and around the
vehicle shall not leave the vehicle without the PII principal’s permission. Data mini-
mization also demands the storage of sensed data to be limited, especially when the
data can easily be recollected when needed again. Last but not least, limiting the
linkability of the PII collected calls for anonymization and aggregation of any data that
is not needed for individual cases.
• Information security: Information security refers to protecting PII with appropriate
controls at operational, functional and strategic levels to ensure the integrity, conﬁ-
dentiality and availability of the PII, and protect it against risks such as unauthorized
access, destruction, use, modiﬁcation, disclosure or loss throughout the whole of its
life cycle. Information security spans a wide spectrum from choosing an appropriate
PII processor to limiting access to PII to those individuals who require such access to
perform their duties. Sects. 24.4.2 and 24.4.3 describe related measures.
Data usage beyond that absolutely needed to provide the service for which the data was
collected requires explicit consent. So for any PII collected and transferred beyond the
domain of the PII principal, there must be a clear and convincing rationale with regard to
relevant privacy principles. The rationale must be convincing for the PII principal in terms
of what is gained and what is given up. The rationale must also be convincing for the
regulator, who will check whether the PII principal is being misled, e.g. by stating a data
processing necessity that does not exist when, following the data minimization principle,
an alternative methodology or technology could be chosen. The regulator will also check,
whether fundamental rights would be endangered by processing the data; fundamental
rights cannot simply be given up by users through consent, as they may not understand the
consequences. A related example would be asking users to store and process their voting
behavior.
Any PII that may enable users to be discriminated against according to their beliefs,
thoughts or actions (e.g. topics of interest and related locations and destinations (e.g.
towards a political demonstration), also in relation to other people’s locations and desti-
nations of) is in many practical cases especially critical.
One example for a reasoning can be found in the landmark decision of the German
Constitutional Court from 1983 [10], that established the fundamental right of “Infor-
mational Self-Determination” in Germany and asks to beware of a “chilling effect” on
citizens’ participation in democratic processes: A person who is uncertain as to whether
unusual behavior is being taken note of, used, or transferred to others will attempt to avoid
standing out through such behavior. Persons who assume, for example, that attendance of
24
Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making …
509
an assembly or participation in a citizens’ interest group will be ofﬁcially recorded, and
that this could expose them to risks, will possibly waive the exercising of their corre-
sponding fundamental rights. This would not only restrict the possibilities for personal
development of those individuals but also be detrimental to the public good, as
self-determination is an elementary prerequisite for the functioning of a free democratic
society based on the freedom of action and participation of its citizens.
Similar considerations are especially relevant in countries with unstable political
governance, where citizens have to fear that a future government may not tolerate
behavior that would currently be perfectly legal. This may include travelling to a political
meeting.
Moreover, the Snowden revelations [11] have shown that there are severe weaknesses
to be considered in the data security governance of many entities storing PII, especially
data attractive to intelligence agencies. These developments can be expected to be
included in future risk analyses and considerations.
24.4.2 Additional Surveillance Measures for “Data-Protected”
Usage of Additional Data
Additional surveillance measures for a “data-protected” usage of the additional data can
be foreseen. They are motivated, for example, by the ISO/IEC 29100 principle of
accountability [8].
The accountability principle means that the processing of PII entails a duty of care and
the adoption of concrete and practical measures for its protection. This will apply to any
party processing PII. The measures are supposed to not only secure the proper processing,
but also enable and ease supervision by regulatory authorities, e.g. data protection
commissioners.
The information security principle (cf. also Sect. 24.4.1) calls, for example, for controls
at operational, functional and strategic levels to ensure the integrity, conﬁdentiality and
availability of the PII, and protect it against risks such as unauthorized access, destruction,
use, modiﬁcation, disclosure or loss throughout the whole of its life cycle.
Typical issues of importance are to audit who had or has access to the PII and who
worked or works with it in which way. Additional surveillance measures will therefore
apply to any additional entity that may have access to the PII. Experience with auditing
has shown that it can lead to additional privacy problems, as audit records on processing
may be used in an even more discriminatory way than the data themselves. An example
could be an entry in a trafﬁc control center’s audit log that PII on the reaction times of a
certain driver’s interaction with the driving robot were examined by a task force to
analyze driving behavior.
Moreover, additional surveillance measures should not lead to oversurveillance of the
individuals working with the system, at least in regions where privacy in the workplace is
510
K. Rannenberg
protected. So a ﬁne balance has to be found depending on the relation between customer
protection and employee protection.
24.4.3 Limiting Access Rights and Encryption
Limiting access rights and encryption are typical instruments of information security.
Limiting access rights is also mentioned under the “Information Security” principle of
ISO/IEC 29100. It follows the concept of “need-to-know”, limiting access to PII to those
individuals who require such access to perform their duties, and limiting the access of
those individuals to only that PII which they require to perform their duties. Access rights
can be deﬁned by deﬁning exactly which entity can access which PII. This asks for a
ﬁne-grained speciﬁcation of the system, and can best be achieved if privacy is already
considered during the design phase, e.g. when designing which data are collected by the
vehicle and for which application they are needed.
Another way to limit access rights is to deﬁne that only groups of entities can jointly
access certain data, e.g. any kind of audit records. This four-eye principle (or n-eye
principle) helps against unauthorized use of data and can especially apply to audit records
of system behavior involving PII. One could specify, for example, that these kinds of data
are only made available to address a deﬁned system failure, and that both the PII principal
and the interested party, e.g. an authorized repair shop, need to agree on the access. The
n-eye principle can also be implemented by encryption if parts of keys are distributed
among the respective stakeholders.
Encryption is not directly mentioned in ISO/IEC 29100 as its use is sometimes con-
sidered controversial in some ISO/IEC member states. However, encryption is mentioned
as an example of a requirement for transmitting medical PII over a public network ([8],
Clause 4.4.7). It is also being asked for more and more by Privacy Commissioners, who
have understood its advantages, especially for creating virtual vaults or tunnels to protect
PII even without the cooperation of the entity storing or transporting the PII. If encryption
is used, it is important to deﬁne clearly who will be allowed to hold the keys for the
respective encryption and decryption. PII providing clues to an individual’s behavior and
abilities may need to be protected by an asymmetric encryption system, and then by
encrypting the PII with the public key of the respective individual. This would ensure that
the PII can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key of the individual.
24.5
Architectural Considerations
Any architectural considerations need to consider the interests of systems’ stakeholders.
PII stakeholders mentioned in this text so far include drivers, passengers and owners of
cars. Other stakeholders may be individuals who need to work with the PII, perhaps also
24
Opportunities and Risks Associated with Collecting and Making …
511
bystanders on the street or other trafﬁc participants if they can be identiﬁed by the system.3
It turns out to be useful to consider non-professional users of systems especially, as they
usually have less opportunity to protect themselves [12]. They are usually also those
entities that Privacy Commissioners are meant to look after.
In general, architecture characteristics can be derived from the principles discussed in
Sect. 24.4.1. The principles of collection limitation, data minimization, and information
security are especially relevant for architectural considerations. Any architecture that
allows a service to be provided that collects, uses and spreads less PII not only reduces the
damaging consequences of any misuse, but also eases the securing of information.
Three architecture characteristics and elements are especially recommendable:
1. Decentralized approaches: If PII is not transferred to central entities, such as trafﬁc
centers, the risk of misuse is reduced. Examples include:
– If, in any of the cases, a situation can be resolved directly between two vehicles,
this is better than involving a trafﬁc control center or other external entity.
Sometimes the issue of the trustworthiness of the information provided by other
vehicles is brought up. A quick solution seems to be to identify the other vehicle
individually and to check it against a central registration database, similarly to a
police car checking registration plates of cars. This may be a nice sales scenario for
selling directory services, but viewing it as a gain for privacy or security is
short-sighted. It would transfer an exceptional police activity into a regular activity
performed by perhaps every vehicle, and so establish a massive surveillance
infrastructure. Moreover, being able to identify a car precisely does not give any
guarantee for the information provided by that vehicle. This information may still
be manipulated and misleading even if a valid identiﬁer is sent by the vehicle
originating the information.
– The concept of a user-owned “Private Data Vault” (PDV) to store PII should be
explored in more detail to enable the storage of sensitive data under the user’s
control. This PDV could store the PII of the respective individuals and protect it
against unwanted access, so that access is not possible without those individuals’
consent. Especially for drivers using cars used by several drivers, and for rental
customers or drivers, this would be useful. A PDV could be installed within the
vehicle (in the special case of vehicles used mainly by a single person) or would
ideally be brought by the respective driver when using the car. The PDV should use
appropriate hardware protection for storing the data, and can be the initialization of
trustworthy data stores. A combination with other personal devices such as mobile
phones might be possible in future, but ﬁrst these devices need to become more
secure and better able to protect themselves, especially against outside approaches
3This may be a motivation to design the system in such a way that it does not identify bystanders on
the street or other trafﬁc participants.
512
K. Rannenberg
to read their data. Related concepts exist for road toll charging, see e.g. [13], and
pay-as-you drive insurance, see e.g. [14].
– If data needs to be stored that is not only personal data of the car user, but also of
other parties, such as environmental data (it may identify other people, but also the
route the user used), the four-or-n-eye principle should be applied for access
control.
– In Use Case 2, trafﬁc control centers or other entities involved in the choice of
parking spaces should not ask the drivers or passengers for all kinds of priorities for
a parking space or route, but instead give some options, so that the user or, a local
system assisting the user, can choose. This reduces the risk of a centralized pro-
cessing of users’ attitudes with regards to prices and locational preferences.
2. Anonymization: Information that needs to be collected for a justiﬁed purpose does not
necessarily need to be collected in a way that identiﬁes the respective individual. Even
information that is collected in a way that identiﬁes individuals may not need to be
processed further in such a way. This holds especially for any information that is only
needed in an aggregated form:
– Trafﬁc and congestion analysis does not need to identify individual cars or even
drivers.
– Interaction with peers, e.g. exchanging data for trafﬁc safety with other vehicles,
does not require identiﬁcation (see the discussion above under “Decentralized
approaches”).
– Not even access control for cars (e.g. to decide access to parking spaces) needs to
identify cars individually. The concepts of Partial Identities (ISO/IEC 24760-1,
[15]) and Privacy-friendly Attribute Based Credentials [16] allow the limiting of
information presented in such cases to what is really needed to gain access. For
example, in Use Case 2 the certiﬁed information that a parking space was booked
for the autonomous valet-parking of a vehicle does not need to identify the indi-
vidual vehicle towards the access control system of the parking space. Transferring
a presentation token that only identiﬁes the vehicle if it is used twice (and is
therefore misused) should sufﬁce.
3. Systematic deletion of PII: Data deletion is often neglected in concepts and life-cycle
models for ICT systems. Especially in the case of PII, this can lead to dangerous
misuse and consequential liabilities. Therefore, draft architectures in any of the cases
should already be including concepts for systematic data deletion; this requires careful
consideration as to how long which data need to be kept for which purpose. Within the
German Standardization Organization DIN, and also at ISO/IEC, standardization ini-
tiatives for data deletion have been started, see e.g. [17]. These initiatives build to a
major degree on the data deletion concept of the German Toll Collect road pricing
scheme for trucks.

24.6
Long-term Considerations
It seems likely that any infrastructures for autonomous driving will be large, and therefore
that any planning for their introduction, use, and maintenance needs to be long-term.
A few remarks about long-term experiences should, then, be useful:
1. Application creep: Once a technical infrastructure is established for some applications,
new additional applications “piggy-backing” on the same technology and infrastruc-
ture but with more privacy risks can be easy to implement. This has been experienced,
for instance for the GSM mobile communication network, which has a lot of powerful
functionality; or for localization, whose de-facto-introduction and exploitation in some
countries has been a grey area. Related fears exist for road tolling systems and their
surveillance infrastructures established for trucks or other commercial vehicles only.
The extension to private cars may be easy.
2. Creep from test systems to real systems: Experience in Internet software development
shows that the step from a test system, or even an experimental prototype with reduced
or no security or privacy protection, to a real production system may be as easy as
changing the web link on a public portal to point to a new backend system. Such a
change may lead to test systems being rushed into real production, while these systems
may not be protected like real systems. Particularly projects that are short of resources
and need quick success can be tempted by this strategy.
3. Mandatory pseudo-unique identiﬁcation: More and more computer devices store and
issue identiﬁers that identify these devices more or less uniquely and reliably. One
example is the GSM International Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IMEI). In
theory, the IMEI is a unique identiﬁer for every GSM mobile communication device;
in practice, it can be manipulated. A similar situation exists for the Media Access
Control address (MAC address) in Internet networks, which theoretically is a unique
identiﬁer assigned to network interfaces. Both identiﬁers also relate to cars equipped
with the respective communication technology. While the security of these systems is
low, they make (unofﬁcial) data collections very easy and hence create major privacy
problems. Moreover, they foster a recurring “appetite” in interested parties for more
identiﬁcation of users in communication networks or Internet services. This trend
needs to be recognized, considered, and overcome [18].
24.7
Concluding Considerations
One may think that a higher degree of autonomy in driving would lead to more data
processing to enable the autonomous driving, and consequently to more surveillance.
Actually, this is not necessarily the case. The two main factors leading to the collection
and spreading of additional data through autonomous driving are:
514
K. Rannenberg
1. The interaction between the vehicle and the driver(s), passenger(s) and possibly owner
(s) becomes more intensive, which leads to the storage and processing of additional
data.
2. The interaction of the vehicle with other entities, especially with any kind of trafﬁc
control center becomes more intensive, which leads to additional transfer of potentially
sensitive data out of the vehicle.
An autonomously driving vehicle that drives sufﬁciently autonomously, that it does not
need to interact with a driver, does not need to collect more data from a driver than any
“conventional” car. Also, if the vehicle is able to autonomously navigate through trafﬁc
and reach its destination, it would not communicate more data than any other vehicle, and
even less data, than a conventional car using a centralized navigation system and that is
under surveillance, e.g. by a system that constantly collects the geo-coordinates of the car.
Of course, some of the close-to reality intermediate scenarios, e.g. a vehicle handing
over to a driver in critical situations (see e.g. Use Case 1) combined with a centralized
surveillance in critical situation can lead to more surveillance and consequently more
privacy problems. So while, in theory, vehicles driving more autonomously does not
necessarily lead to more privacy problems, there is a realistic threat that in practice this
will happen if the design and architecture do not carefully avoid privacy problems.
Therefore, an approach of privacy-by-design for autonomous driving-scenarios is
needed. At least for the following questions, one needs to perform a thorough check:
– Is the collection, processing, or transmission of data really needed for a real
improvement in the driving situation?
– Is this advantage worth the additional privacy risks?
– In potential dilemmas between more functionality and more safety on the one hand,
and less privacy on the other, can the PII stakeholders (often drivers, passengers,
owners) be enabled to decide for themselves and in an informed manner?
– Do the data stay under the control of the PII stakeholders, or do they leave their
domain of control?
There is clearly a challenge to protect the freedom that has been associated with
personal cars for a long time, and that is one of the reasons for their success. Perhaps a
unique selling point for the established car industry, and especially premium manufac-
turers and brands, is to not simply follow the easy trend of Internet businesses in letting
information ﬂow everywhere unless they get stopped by legislation or customer outrage,
but rather to facilitate proper protection for their customers. The car industry has shown in
other areas, for instance in the reduction of energy consumption, that one does not need to
accept primitive solutions, but can overcome adverse effects and reduce resource usage by
careful planning and engineering. The triggers for this approach will come anyway.

Part V
Law and Liability
The articles in the “Law and Liability” section examine, from a higher perspective, the
respective signiﬁcance of various legal systems for a social structure that allows for
autonomous driving. The vantage point here is here primarily formed by, and partially
limited to, the authors’ knowledge of the American and German systems of law, as well as
auto industry practices. For the most part, however, the focus is on matters of overriding
importance within the respective legal systems, the fundamental values of social order,
and the probable long-term legal institutions and interests. This allows conclusions to be
drawn on the forward-looking topic. Given this abstract approach, it should also be said
for this section that all stated legal views on these matters of the future are those of the
authors and are no substitute for legal advice in individual cases.
To understand the challenges of the long-term objectives of autonomous driving, one
must be aware that, so far, “autonomous machine activity” on public roads clearly accords
with the day-to-day reality of very few legal systems. This also applies to individually
proactive US states. Even if the trained eye of an expert is frequently required, today’s
prototypical systems involving high degrees of automation mostly still assume a human
driver’s presence as a supervisor for technical reasons. The greatest challenge from a legal
standpoint lies in dispensing with this established and widely accepted driving activity of
controlling the vehicle. The articles in this section lay out in detail the causes of the legal
uncertainties brought about by this change. In part, it has been possible to identify
questions for future research that may help to better understand any potential changes. But
it has also been possible to derive strategies and recommendations that take these changes
into account and may make adaptation easier.
In his article Fundamental and Speciﬁc Legal Questions Concerning Autonomous
Vehicles, Tom Gasser provides an in-depth examination of today’s road trafﬁc and its
dangers in light of the human right to life and physical integrity. Based on this, Gasser
demonstrates that the basic change on the road to autonomous driving consists in tran-
sitioning from driver-controlled vehicles to autonomous machine activity in public space
without being able to wholly rule out dangers in this process. The author deems this
change signiﬁcant in respect of constitutional law. This examination of the legal impact of
autonomous driving then goes on to look closer into the risks resulting from automation
Tom Michael Gasser
and the hypothesis of the “dilemma situation.” Fundamental design requirements for
autonomous control functions to protect pedestrians and cyclists result from this, as well
as further research questions to determine the causes of trafﬁc accidents in today’s road
transport system. In the author’s view, a deep understanding of these causal processes
could lead to further insights into the safe design of autonomous driving. Alongside some
more speciﬁc issues, the article details the communication between road users. Here lies a
need for fundamentally new concepts in the long-term objective of autonomous vehicle
operation.
Product liability in the United States is the focus of the article Product Liability Issues
in the U.S. and Associated Risk Management by Stephen Wu. Risk management of
product liability is a signiﬁcant challenge that automobile industry and other ﬁrms in the
sector have to face up to if their aim is to sell autonomous vehicles in the U.S.
Autonomous-vehicle manufacturers may thereby be exposed to very considerable, pos-
sibly even existential risks. The abstract-seeming risk and its triggering factors are
illustrated with lively accounts of product liability cases in the automobile sector over
recent decades. This overview makes the risks tangible and clear. Against this backdrop of
experience, recommendations are given for product liability law risk management in the
development and safety validation process. The manufacturer can minimize risks through
careful preparation for potential product liability cases.
Taking as its starting point an abstract analysis of the risks and uncertainties thrown up
by both autonomous and today’s vehicles, Bryant Walker Smith outlines the considerable
challenge that regulation represents in practice. In the conclusion of his article Regulation
and the Risk of Inaction, he arrives at a total of eight recommendations for guiding
strategy—mainly concerning public bodies, but also private stakeholders affected by
autonomous driving. These strategies tackle either the risks themselves or the negative
consequences and effects of autonomous driving. The argument of this innovative
approach rests on the opportunities offered by vehicle automation. One of Walker Smith’s
basic opening observations regarding regulation is on its necessity. If decisions in the
areas that guide action are not taken by those responsible for an abstract decision, they will
only be shifted to the next level in cases of materialized risk. This would lead, for
example, to courts having to deal with the very same questions.
Thomas Winkle’s article is on the Technical, Legal, and Economic Risks in the
Development and Approval of Automated Vehicles. Based on many years’ expertise, he
traces the technical improvements in vehicle safety over recent decades. Greater vehicle
safety and reliability are faced with higher consumer expectations. Using Federal Court of
Justice rulings on product liability, the author also depicts and gives substance to the
expectations and requirements placed on automobile manufacturers. Particular attention,
however, is given to the indirect economic effects of product crises on vehicle manu-
facturers, of which customers’ loss of trust can be the severest consequence. The article
shows real opportunities for manufacturers to impact vehicle safety in development and
approval. These include not only the development of new approaches for new safety and
520

testing concepts, but also the recommendation of an internationally agreed Code of
Practice based on the equivalent code for the safe design and evaluation of
driver-assistance systems, which appears equally advisable for automated vehicles. With a
historical glance back to the initial stages of the automobile, in the closing remarks it is
argued how excessive perfectionism may hinder the introduction of an innovation. In
conclusion, therefore, the conscientious and careful application of available expertise is
proposed as an innovation-friendly approach to the development of automated vehicles.

Fundamental and Special Legal Questions
for Autonomous Vehicles
Tom Michael Gasser
25.1
Introduction
The “Autonomous driving on the roads of the future: Villa Ladenburg Project” by the
Daimler und Benz-Stiftung looks at degrees of automation that will only become tech-
nically feasible in the distant future. The treatment of the legal questions in the present
chapter therefore draws heavily on the description of the use cases (see Chap. 2), which
begin to provide a concrete basis for evaluating individual issues. Uncertainties in pre-
dicting future technical developments can be expected and will have a commensurate
impact on the assumptions and conclusions of this chapter. The resulting uncertainty is
nevertheless unavoidable if one wants to press ahead with important interrelated issues.
This chapter is therefore intended as a contribution to the debate on societal aspects of
automated driving from a legal perspective and not as a legalistic evaluation of the subject.
The consideration will largely focus on the situation within the context of current German
law. The legal views expressed are those of the author and are based on nine years of
experience in the ﬁeld of driver assistance system research.
In terms of the underlying conception presented here, the societal dimension of
autonomous vehicles addressed in the present project goes well beyond the adjustments to
the legal framework currently being called for in Germany. The following will examine
the question of “societal acceptance” in the context of the legal questions raised by
autonomous vehicles. This line of investigation is not immediately obvious and covers
only a segment of the more thoroughgoing focus of the project (see Chap. 29).
Autonomous vehicles will presumably only attain widespread success when their
overall societal beneﬁts exceed the damage associated with them [1]. This early
hypothesis, asserted in regard to driver assistance systems, must be regarded in relation to

the supremely important matter of trafﬁc safety. The requirement would be fulﬁlled if
overall trafﬁc safety were improved through advancements in the vehicle technology
(which, however, would not necessarily result in societal acceptance (see Chap. 29)).
Even today it may be surmised that autonomous vehicles which are controlled on the basis
of automated perception of the environment will not be capable of completely ﬂawless
operation. It may therefore be concluded that even with autonomous vehicles, there will
continue to be individual severe damage incidents, which in extreme cases will include
multiple human deaths. The societal acceptance of autonomous vehicles therefore nec-
essarily depends upon societal acceptance of the consequences of these developments.
From a legal perspective, the fundamental issue at hand is understanding and accepting the
“effect of autonomous vehicles” in the public space as an independent “action” by
machine. This situation in road trafﬁc would indeed be totally new (other forms of
transportation such as automated, driverless trains generally strictly implement the con-
cept of separation between automated control and public space through physical barriers;
there are, apparently, very few exceptions,1 which, however, seek to exclude any resulting
dangers by means of exhaustive safety concepts nearly completely see [2]).
The novelty of autonomous vehicles as effective actors in the public space of road trafﬁc
from a legal standpoint can be demonstrated—as will be attempted in the following—in
order to highlight that societal acceptance of such a substantial change must indeed begin to
take root (see Chap. 30) before it can begin to have an impact on the adjustment of relevant
regulations.
25.2
Previous Work and Preliminary Considerations
To this author’s knowledge, the question of societal acceptance of driver assistance systems
with machine perception was ﬁrst raised by Homann [1] in the context of a working con-
ference in October 2002. The contents of that paper can be applied to the present examination
of autonomous vehicles. In this regard, it can only be concluded that the societal acceptance
issue that was discussed at the time with regard to “new generation driver assistance systems”
has yet to become anchored in the public consciousness as a “problem,” although the systems
discussed back then have become available on the open market and sufﬁciently widespread
to reveal the existence of any actual problems. This is presumably due to the fact that to date,
spectacular negative effects resulting from such systems (as could be imagined in the case of
emergency braking assistance, for example) have not been recorded. One reason for this
could be that the systems do indeed function (almost) ﬂawlessly. A more differentiated
explanatory approach, however, is that any such interventions in the control of the vehicle
1RUBIN project for the automation of the U2 and U3 subway lines in Nuremberg: Provisional
mixed operation of automated and conventionally controlled trains was implemented on a route
section between Rathenauplatz and Rothenburger Strasse. Moreover, the concept does not employ a
physical barrier along the platforms, but rather a sensor-based platform safety system.
524
T.M. Gasser
only occur extremely brieﬂy in very accident-proximate situations. This suggests the use of a
technical variant that only intervenes when the evaluation of the environment recognition
system determines a very high probability that an intervention is indeed necessary, thus
reducing negative effects to a minimum. It must also be taken into account that the driver still
has the duty to perform all requisite control functions. Thus the driver potentially remains
available as a comprehensive fallback level in all cases of non-activation. The result of these
considerations is the relatively minor signiﬁcance of such functions not only in terms of their
share of active time in the overall control of the vehicle but also with regard to the reliability
expected of them. Such functions can therefore only be used in a very limited capacity in
conjunction with independent or autonomous vehicle control systems: The subordinate
signiﬁcance and a tightly circumscribed “ﬁeld of action” of a function lead to a strengthening
of the driver’s role. This is presumably an important reason why the discussion regarding
societal acceptance has not taken place thus far.
There is little reason to believe, however, that societal acceptance will play an equally
minor role in the case of autonomous vehicles: If one takes the representative use cases
used as the basis for the current project as a baseline (see Chap. 2), it becomes clear that
they demonstrate a very high degree of automation. The “automated driving capability” of
these use cases as a reference value is deﬁned in greater detail in terms of “capabilities of
perception, cognition, behavioral decisions and behavior execution” (see underlying
deﬁnitions in Chap. 2). A machine-based “autonomy” of the vehicle emerges which
makes it possible to speak of “driving robots” “as a subject … analogous to the role of the
driver in the vehicles of today” (see Chap. 2). At this point it becomes clear that we are
speaking of a very fundamental shift that will be accompanied by the introduction of such
automated decisions in the public space.
Not much can be said about the question of societal acceptance of autonomous
automated driving capabilities from a legal standpoint. However, what legal regulations
will presumably reﬂect to a high degree is what can be regarded as amenable to consensus
on the societal level—an assumption which can be regarded as justiﬁed, at the very least
where individual regulations are not discussed and scrutinized by a wide swath of the
public. Comparing autonomous vehicles with current law shows that the spirit of current
regulations does indeed not cover independent “performance” by machines in the public
space (understood as behavioral decisions and behavior execution as a new sense of
automated action; see above).
Laws should be abstractly/generally applicable to all life situations. This maxim also
fundamentally applies to the stipulations of trafﬁc law. But when changes to the realities
of life emerge which cause previously fundamental presumptions to lose their validity, as
would be the case in the eventuality of autonomous vehicles with decision-making
capacities in the public space, this can only be represented through an application of the
law. It is possible to precisely describe the emergent change and bring the overarching
fundamental values of our society—such as basic rights—into the argument, which can
provide a framework which will presumably outlive the changes and set the parameters for
development.
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
525
25.3
The Current Traffic Situation as a Starting Point
Fundamental state duties even with regard to road trafﬁc accidents can be traced back to
the constitution. In view of the hazards associated with road trafﬁc, the basic rights
relating to life and physical integrity [protected by article 2, paragraph 2, clause 1 of
Germany’s Fundamental Law (GG)] are paramount. The scope of protection afforded by
the basic right to life includes protection for all (universal fundamental right) not only
against targeted homicide, but also against behaviors that may unintentionally (unintended
interventions such as the effects of accidents) cause death. The state’s duty to provide
protection is comprehensive and also affords protection against illicit interventions by
third parties. This ultimately leads, where interventions cannot be justiﬁed, to a state duty
to prohibit such interventions, for example by establishing rule of law [3].
Here a discrepancy between the realities of life in society and constitutionally grounded
rights comes into focus. Notable in particular is the fact that “trafﬁc safety [is barely
discussed], although the still large number of trafﬁc deaths and permanently severely
injured accident victims provide ample reason to do just that” [3]. Indeed, in the media
major trafﬁc accidents are regularly treated as relatively insigniﬁcant matters of merely
regional interest. The phenomenon that emerges from this view, namely that the dangers
associated with the current trafﬁc situation, excites so little interest and plays such a minor
role in the socio-political discussion [4], which can at least be seen as an indicator of broad
societal acceptance of this state of affairs.
At the same time, the duty to protect vis-à-vis the “risks of technology” is critically
important with regard to road trafﬁc as well. Statistics are recorded on (severe) road trafﬁc
accidents (as per section 5, paragraph 3 of the Law on the Statistics of Road Trafﬁc
Accidents (StVUnfStatG), with research conducted by the Federal Highway Research
Institute), which enables precise monitoring of trafﬁc safety trends and accident causes
(bearing in mind that the number of road trafﬁc deaths has shown an overall decline for
many years). Yet the signiﬁcance of trafﬁc safety extends far beyond this as a critical
factor in trafﬁc policy overall, including in (but not limited to) the establishment and
adaptation of trafﬁc-related (driver permission, vehicle technology, behavioral and many
other) legal regulations, but also in the design of roadways, road maintenance, road
equipment, and so on. In spite of these various efforts and ongoing improvements, the
status quo of 3339 deaths and 374,142 injuries (in Germany in 2013) remains a reality
with which no one can truly be satisﬁed.
Finally, from a very fundamentally legal perspective, the question arises as to the
constitutional rationale for these interventions in the fundamental rights to life and physical
integrity. It can be argued on the basis of the mobility requirements of other fundamental
rights-bearers associated with motor vehicle trafﬁc and their willingness to subject them-
selves to the concomitant hazards of such trafﬁc on account of the beneﬁts associated with
it. But even that is not universally valid, in particular if one considers that the dangers that
ﬂow from motor vehicles, in view of the considerable operational hazards in comparison to
526
T.M. Gasser
non-motorized trafﬁc participants, does not allow for any utterly unambiguous argumen-
tation: While with motorized trafﬁc participants it can be argued that they are prepared to
accept the increased danger associated with motor vehicles which they themselves create,
this cannot be extended to pedestrians or bicyclists [3]. That said, pedestrians and bicy-
clists, with 557 and 354 deaths, and 30,897 and 71,066 injuries, respectively (for 2013) [5],
represent a signiﬁcant share of all road trafﬁc accidents in Germany.
Nevertheless, it seems probable that across broad sections of the public, there will be a
signiﬁcant degree of consensus that the consequences of road trafﬁc are acceptable in view
of the mobility needs of society. If one were to venture the thought experiment of
imagining signiﬁcant limitations of motor vehicle trafﬁc in the interest of improving trafﬁc
safety, this would at the same time mean failing to take account of some other important
societal needs: Immediately effective (radical) changes would obviously be associated
with substantial limitations on individual (motorized) mobility, as well as (and not only)
the general freedom of action protected in the Basic Law under section 2, paragraph 1
GG). Because such an approach would be extreme, its proportionality comes under
scrutiny: Identifying any such measures which would be suitable to the task in view of
roadway driving of a total of 724 billion kilometers (in 2013 in Germany) [5] and yet not
result in severe consequences for the economic development of the country, the ability of
people to carry out their jobs, the provision of public services and much more, is virtually
inconceivable. Against this backdrop, the probability of a majority being in favor of
restrictions with regard to motor vehicle trafﬁc is low. The currently practiced approach of
continuous improvement of trafﬁc safety thus emerges—as the positive development
heretofore attests—as successful, realistic and exemplary. The aforementioned appeal
from a constitutional standpoint for a more vigorous debate on trafﬁc safety does not in
itself call into question the existing legal situation with respect to road trafﬁc, but instead
highlights, at this stage, the importance of trafﬁc safety efforts in this context.
But if one carries the pursuit of causes of the comparatively poor performance of road
trafﬁc compared to other forms of transportation, it is worthwhile to consider a funda-
mentally unique factor with regard to road trafﬁc. With the legal deﬁnition of roads as
“public goods in public use … [which] are made immediately available to the public for
the established purpose without special permission”, including recognition of roads as a
“multi-purpose institution” [6], attention is rightly drawn to a characteristic in which road
trafﬁc as we know it today—including the associated accidents—is rooted. As public
goods in public use, roads exist not only for the purpose of changing locations (trafﬁc in
the narrower sense), but also serve to enable commercial and communicative trafﬁc (trafﬁc
in a broader sense) [7]. Ultimately this deﬁnition of the purpose of “roads” gives rise to a
multiplicity of trafﬁc situations understood in terms of diversity of trafﬁc participants,
trafﬁc scenarios, sudden, unexpected events and conditions and developments between
trafﬁc participants on roads. A comparable variety of possible interactions in which nearly
the entire population is involved in some form or another and which would be associated
with a comparable risk of injury is not to be found in any other area of life. Roads
therefore have a multifarious function which typically is not the case for the space
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
527
occupied by other forms of transportation. This functional diversity has a signiﬁcant
impact with respect to the circumstances that must be considered in the context of vehicle
control: The requirements for the safe conduct of the driving activity are complex and
diverse in nature. The driver of a motor vehicle is called upon to perform comprehensive
perception of the trafﬁc situation, make decisions and execute appropriate actions on that
basis, particularly with regard to hazard recognition. In terms of the legal framework, at
present this task is primarily regulated through laws governing behavior and driving
license requirements. Just what signiﬁcance the diversity and complexity of the task when
performed by an automated vehicle control apparatus will take on in terms of legal
categories will be examined in the following sections.
25.4
Assessing Autonomous Driving
Against this backdrop, this project on “autonomous driving” raises the fundamental and
far-reaching legal question as to how autonomous vehicles could be integrated into this
agglomeration of factors in legal terms. A starting point for answering this question—as
mentioned above—would be to re-examine and describe the characteristic of such vehi-
cles as “driving robots” or “subject” analogous to the driver (see Chap. 2) and lay out the
associated consequences of such an approach for real-life situations.
25.4.1 Current State of Driver Assistance Systems Available
on the Market
To date, an action and decision quality exists only in the case of human action (which
always exists at least in the sense of the driver’s own perception and decisions—or at least
in the sense of a continuous duty in this respect). In fact this is the still current minimum
requirement in terms of driver participation in controlling the vehicle: Current driver
assistance systems in a broader sense can only aid the driver in controlling the vehicle, not
act as a replacement. At the present moment (August 2014), a division of labor between
the driver and the driver assistance system would be possible involving active control of
the longitudinal and lateral steering of the vehicle (on the basis of independent, automated
environment perception). But this control system currently possesses no independent
decision quality: Rather, it is predicated at all times on the driver’s immediate intervention
and resumption of control of the vehicle if required for whatever reason—for instance due
to faulty perception of the environment by the system. Thus the driver maintains a
superordinate role and responsibility, making the vehicle control by the system appear
derivative and subordinate. From a technical view of this division of labor, this is cur-
rently absolutely necessary, as the driver assistance systems currently available on the
market are not capable of independently recognizing that all system limits have been
reached. One characteristic warning (of several) in the instructions for the “DISTRONIC
528
T.M. Gasser
PLUS” system (an adaptive cruise control and thus a longitudinal control system of
Daimler Corp.) reads as follows (as of August 2014):
WARNING
DISTRONIC PLUS and the active blind-spot assistant are only aids designed to assist you
while driving.
They cannot act as a replacement for your attention. Responsibility for regulating the
distance to other vehicles, for the driving speed and timely braking rests with you. Always
pay attention to the trafﬁc situation and your environment. Otherwise you might recognize
hazards too late, cause an accident and injure yourself and others. [8]
From this warning—which can be found in similar form with other currently available
driver assistance systems—illustrates very clearly that the system can only assist the driver
if the driver maintains uninterrupted attention to his/her own perception of the trafﬁc
situation. All of the control processes automated by the system must be checked by the
driver and overridden as needed through appropriate control actions by the driver.
Driver assistance systems are therefore described from a control engineering per-
spective as a “redundant-parallel” form of the division of labor combined with the same
tasks [9]. This description in terms of division of labor is indeed appropriate from a legal
standpoint, but does not say anything about where decision-making authority lies in case
of contradictory performance of the task. With current driver assistance systems, the
authority to override the driver assistance system at any time always rests with the human
driver. The proper use of the system that emerges from the operating instructions is always
directed towards observing and assuring the proper performance of the system and making
appropriate changes if the system is not acting as it should.
If the longitudinal and lateral control of a vehicle—i.e. the two fundamental aspects of
the driving function in terms of control—are both automated at the same time, this
division of labor is described as partially automated [10]. This does not change the fact,
however, that such systems are not capable of recognizing system limits on their own and
are thus necessarily subjugated to the redundant-parallel perception, decision-making and
action of a human driver (understood as performance of authority in the spirit of “override
in the case of any recognizable need”). Thus with respect to automation which is subject
to monitoring by the driver, the aspect of “authority” attains the legally decisive
signiﬁcance.
The result, then, is that with regard to the driver assistance systems on the market to
date, there is never an independent, but only a derivative action and decision quality
residing in the vehicle control system, which only occurs under the complete authority of
the driver, who continuously monitors it according to regulations.
25.4.2 Autonomous Driving
The matter is fundamentally different in the case of autonomous driving, which is
examined here by means of four representative use cases (see Chap. 2). All four use cases
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
529
envision a driving robot that assumes the vehicle control function. Even the “Interstate
Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability” use case, which clearly recalls current driver
assistance systems, does not indeed require that the “driver” actually perform any func-
tions during automated driving that would correspond to our current deﬁnition of a
“driver”. This emerges in the clear formulation that the driver “becomes a simple pas-
senger during automated driving”.
Thus
autonomous
driving
essentially
envisions
a
situation
in
which
the
redundant-parallel performance of tasks by the driver and the system gives way to—
potentially temporally and spatially delimited—independent automated vehicle control by
the system. The person now ﬁttingly referred to merely as the “vehicle user” does still
retain a “dominant” intervention capability in the aforementioned “Interstate Pilot” use
case, which does not fundamentally differ from the “authority” in the case of driver
assistance systems described in Sect. 25.4.1. However, the basis for performance is rather
likely to be lacking: As soon as the role of the driver changes so dramatically that not only
performance of the task but also observation of the trafﬁc situation and the evaluation of
the automated control decisions which are based on it are dropped, the signiﬁcance of this
“dominance” or “authority” is inevitably limited. Thus even where the vehicle user is
paying attention to the situation, there is de facto no basis for performance of this
“dominance” or “authority”. In the case of the two use cases distinguished by the spatial
absence of the vehicle user (see the “Autonomous Valet Parking” and “Vehicle on
Demand” representative use cases in Chap. 2), the lack of a basis for actually exerting
“dominance” or “authority” is even more evident.
The lack of a basis for immediate observation of the trafﬁc situation as a starting point
for vehicle control can only be interpreted as de facto independence or “autonomy” of the
automated control system. The therefore decisive signiﬁcance of the autonomy of the
automated vehicle control system in the present context has naturally found its way into
the name of the underlying project.
25.5
Fundamental Legal Questions vis-à-vis Autonomous
Driving
Legal questions related to autonomous driving cannot, as touched on in Sect. 25.2,
adequately, let alone exhaustively, be addressed in terms of the current legal framework.
The reason for this is that in their creation and ongoing development, the legal bases of
road trafﬁc law could only take account of considerations that were in need of regulation
at a given time. In the ﬁeld of public road trafﬁc, the question of autonomous vehicles has
not arisen thus far—including in the context of driver assistance systems currently
available on the market (see Sect. 25.4.1): Heretofore it could always be assumed that a
driver would execute vehicle control at least in the sense of redundant-parallel task
performance. If one looks at autonomous driving, by contrast, there is a shift of funda-
mental signiﬁcance towards independent automated vehicle control.
530
T.M. Gasser
25.5.1 Risks of Automation
For autonomous vehicles, it is assumed that “hardware failures and software failures …
[can] also occur with autonomously driving vehicles,” although such vehicles developed
“with state-of-the-art technology” are classiﬁed as “at least as reliable and safe … as
current conventional vehicles are.” The following considerations also demonstrate,
however, that there is a great deal of uncertainty in this regard since the “success rate” in
terms of vehicle control is assumed to be “similar to the quality and success rate of human
drivers”, but at present this represents only a conservative expert opinion which can only
serve as a basis for discussion for the present project (see Chap. 2). Thus the performance
of automated vehicle control systems cannot be deﬁnitively assessed; it may be assumed,
however, that the risk of automation will remain, but at the same time will not be higher
than the risk resulting from human vehicle control.
25.5.1.1
The Automation Risks Against the Backdrop
of Fundamental Rights
If we now examine the aforementioned potential automation risk in light of the situation
of today’s road trafﬁc as it pertains to the fundamental rights to life and physical integrity
(see Sect. 25.3), it becomes clear that the shift from human control to automated vehicle
control would presumably be regarded as “critical to the exercise of fundamental rights”
[11]. Due to the signiﬁcant intervention that any such new automation risk would mean
with respect to the fundamental rights to life and physical integrity, it must be regarded as
probable that a decision regarding the allowance of automated vehicles and thus of an
automation risk ﬂowing from automated control systems in road trafﬁc would fall under
the purview of the legislative authority. The lawmaking body would bear the duty of
making key decisions itself, ﬂowing from the democratic principle and the rule of law.
The critical provisions for the protection of fundamental rights should therefore not be left
in ﬁeld of action or decision-making authority of the executive [12]. This argumentation
places the focus squarely on the novelty of such an automation risk because it would
revolutionize vehicle control in general. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that
the most realistic scenario for the introduction of automated vehicle control is gradual,
step-by-step implementation by means of continual improvement of driver assistance
systems available today (see Chap. 2). This raises the question of whether the transition to
automated vehicle control will still be regarded as “critical” at the time when the decision
is actually made. The Federal Constitutional Court has traditionally been rather restrained
with respect to the parliamentary prerogative regarding the fundamental rights to life and
physical integrity and has been satisﬁed to let questionable types of risks to life be covered
by the legislative will expressed in the atomic energy act (Atomgesetz) [3, 13] (more
speciﬁcally the “breeder technology” in that case). It is also not necessary to explicitly
name the risks and consequences of road trafﬁc that impact the fundamental rights to life
and physical integrity (so there is no unconstitutionality of the road trafﬁc act (StVG)
ﬂowing from this alone in current practice) [13]. Thus the question remains whether the
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
531
road trafﬁc act in its present form can encompass the novel quality of automated control.
At the time of this writing (August 2014), the novelty and independence of the automated
decision quality raises considerable doubts.
Should the underlying assumptions and relationships prove correct, the question of
allowing for an automated control risk in public road trafﬁc would have to be regulated by
formal law (the so-called proviso of formal law). The legislator would be free to permit
risks that remain “below the danger threshold” and which can therefore be justiﬁed, also in
the light of freedom on the part of the person who causes the risk. However, the legislator
is not restricted to this and can also become active below the danger threshold as a means
of minimizing risk, insofar as this is still considered proportionate under constitutional law
[3]. In terms of the magnitude of a potential automation risk, then, it seems—not least in
view of the indicative effect of the situation in current road trafﬁc—realistic to presume a
level of safety and thus also regulatory authority on the part of the legislator that remains
within the scope of “at least as reliable and safe as current vehicles” (see Chap. 2).
25.5.1.2
Liability of the Product Manufacturer for Autonomously
Operating Vehicle Control?
Product liability on the part of the manufacturer with fully-automated systems (see
Chap. 2 for classiﬁcation of the present use cases as “fully automated”) could be deter-
mined in large part through the intended use of the product as deﬁned by the manufac-
turer. Insofar as system functions—as in the case of full automation—no longer envision a
necessary role for the driver with regard to vehicle control, it could in turn be concluded
that the acceptance of prima facie evidence in the event of accident damage is proper: If
(accident) damage occurs in the course of automated driving, the question arises whether
this can be attributed causally to an underlying product defect (insofar as the relevant
cause is not due to an intervention by the driver in the form of an override action or
exclusively the result of improper behavior on the part of another trafﬁc participant—all
within the context of the applicable burden of presentation/proof in civil suits) [10]. In the
ﬁnal result, the decisive question would be whether an incorrect automated control
decision could ultimately be classiﬁed as a product defect and thus that in practically all
cases of incorrect control, civil liability on the part of the manufacturer could be assumed.
In that case, the manufacturer—in addition to the vehicle owner (see also [10])—would
(almost) always bear the liability risk with respect to civil law for the automation risk
associated with the automated action. In view of the expanded possibilities for inter-
vention of automated vehicle control (see Sect. 25.5.2 for more on this), the scope of
application for control-relevant errors would actually even expand vis-à-vis the driver.
Whether this conclusion is appropriate, however, is another question: To a great extent,
the argumentation follows the assumption that the cause of accidents today is regularly
due to improper control decisions on the part of the driver. However, the (in future
potentially automated) vehicle control may represent only one of multiple possible
accident causes.
532
T.M. Gasser
Current road trafﬁc law still seems to be shaped by a different fundamental under-
standing. This becomes clear for instance in the current edition of the road trafﬁc act, which
presumes the existence of “unavoidable events” (which in section 17, paragraph 3 of the
road trafﬁc act (StVG) still play a role in assigning the respective shares of responsibility
for damage between motor vehicles). It must be emphasized, however, that of the cases
currently encompassed by this, from a purely scientiﬁc standpoint and in consideration of
the current state of technical capabilities it may be presumed that only some of these
incidents will in future be considered “unavoidable”. Even so, to date the understanding of
this legal term is only limited insofar as the “the greatest possible care” and the “behavior of
an ‘ideal driver’” in terms of average performance expectations (as opposed to an imputed
“super-driver”) are sufﬁcient [14]. (There is evidently a different underlying idea here: the
question as to responsibility for an accident, not scientiﬁc causality for its occurrence).
Consistent application of the question of scientiﬁc causality could mean that only a
subsection of damages occurring during automated vehicle control would in fact be
traceable to a defective control system (or some other product defect). This would ulti-
mately fundamentally call into question the aforementioned inference of damage due to
the existence of a product defect during automated control. The open question in this
context is therefore to what extent the current “road trafﬁc system” represents an inde-
pendently relevant cause for accident damage (vis-à-vis control decisions that might be
automated).
25.5.2 “Dilemma Situations”
In the context of the legal discussion, the suggestive term “dilemma situation” encom-
passes two interconnected aspects which can pointedly describe the characteristic prop-
erties of automated action and illustrate the consequences of a worst-case scenario of such
a transformation with exceptional clarity: ﬁrst, the expansion of the scope of intervention
in the control of the vehicle in time-critical situations and second, the question as to the
implementation of an automated control decision within the scope of fundamental rights.
To begin with, we must fundamentally question the existence of “dilemma situations” in
road trafﬁc. It is particularly unclear whether the underlying thought model of unavoid-
ability is compelling. In road trafﬁc, individual cases provide diverse, discreet and strongly
situation-dependent opportunities to intervene in vehicle control. Preceding alternative
control decisions in road trafﬁc thus offer—potentially, this would have to be examined in
greater detail—the possibility of taking action to prevent the occurrence of an unavoidable
situation in which damage was inevitable. It would seem, then, that the possibility of
preventing unavoidable situations through anticipatory vehicle control behavior cannot be
excluded. On the other hand, it could turn out that certain hazards in road trafﬁc arise from
its very nature and are indeed not avoidable (for example due to the plenitude of possible
interactions of differently protected trafﬁc participants). In exceptional cases, the potential
coincidence of two possible damages would then need to be assumed realistic, requiring a
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
533
consideration of “dilemma situations”. In legal categories, the question as to relevant
accident causes is thus brought up which is subject to scientiﬁc determination both in terms
of internal (vehicle control-dependent) and external (trafﬁc system-dependent) factors.
Irrespective of the result of this theoretical examination of vehicle control in road
trafﬁc, discussion-worthy aspects emerge from the consideration: Using “dilemma situa-
tions” makes it possible to delineate a framework with respect to fundamental rights for
automated control decisions. If one presumes the existence of “dilemma situations”, it also
emerges that a limitation of the manufacturer’s responsibility could be called for in these
cases because damages due to control actions would then be just as unavoidable as they
would be in the case of the existence of independent risks ﬂowing from the “road trafﬁc
system” per se (see Sect. 25.5.1).
Finally, it should be noted that “dilemma situations” are also addressed in various
forms in the discussion of ethical aspects, where they are likewise used as a means of
illuminating and examining the overarching ethical considerations (see Chap. 4).
25.5.2.1
Expansion of the Scope of Influence
The conceptual model of “dilemma situations” for autonomous vehicles is based on the
working hypothesis that certain acutely accident-proximate situations could still be
affected by the use of automated vehicle control: In many cases it could therefore be
possible to “save” materially endangered legal interests literally at the last second. With
the current state of technology (and exclusively human vehicle control), these situations
always require consideration of the driver’s reaction time [14]. The thus delayed control
action can, depending on the case, inﬂuence the occurrence of an accident or its conse-
quences. In fact this working hypothesis, taken in the context of a transition to automated
control decisions, is by no means far-fetched. Further, it may also be assumed that another
beneﬁt could be achieved, namely that an automated control system could consider
alternative control options, such as avoiding rather than braking for an acutely endangered
pedestrian, which average drivers seldom succeed in doing [15]. One salient working
hypothesis underlying the “dilemma situations” is therefore that automated vehicle control
could lead to controlling trafﬁc situations which were previously uncontrolled or only
controlled after a delay.
25.5.2.2
The Automated Control Decision
A further assumption in the “dilemma situation” conceptual model which builds on the
preceding takes account of the novel automated “decision quality” of an autonomous
vehicle control system. This point of view is explicitly expressed in the designation of the
“driving robot” as a “subject” which is revealed—with all due care in this regard—in the
underlying deﬁnitions of the current project (see Chap. 2). In order to highlight this effect
and argue the ethical dimension of automated control decision-making, a decision
dilemma is brought in to accentuate the underlying quandary. This ampliﬁcation is not to
be regarded as a completely unrealistic scenario and worthy of discussion per se because it
deals with the societal acceptance of a wide-ranging decision-making quality which is
534
T.M. Gasser
hereby brought into focus. This automated decision-making quality can, in individual
cases—as constructed in the “dilemma situations”—impact the right of the (acutely
endangered) individual to life and physical integrity and is thus not fundamentally dif-
ferent than in the case of the hazards affecting fundamental rights in road trafﬁc as it exists
today (see also Sect. 25.3). The major difference lies only in the underlying automated
control.
25.5.2.3
Critical Analysis of the “Dilemma Situation”
In any theoretical analysis of the possible consequences of automated control decisions, it
is only possible to do justice to the matter if it is made clear that the “dilemma situation” in
the form of the “decision dilemma,” insofar as it exists at all, represents an absolutely
exceptional case. In the interest of proper assessment, it must therefore be stated at the
outset that this could only be an exceedingly rare exception.
The assumption underlying the dilemma is that there is no alternative to damaging two
essentially equivalent objects of legal protection in a concrete individual case although the
automated vehicle control system has taken all alternative possible control decisions into
account. But even if in the concrete situation—in consideration of the control behavior
prior to the hazard becoming acute—there were no alternative to damage, relevant
alternative causes to the control behavior in the antecedent causal chain could be con-
sidered. It therefore seems plausible to assume that dangers may not reside exclusively in
the vehicle control, but indeed inhere in the nature of road trafﬁc in itself and thus ﬂow
from the complexity and variety of possible situations in the “road trafﬁc system” as
described in Sect. 25.3. This seems particularly probable where one considers the inﬂu-
ence of driving speed, for example, which in most cases presumably represents a nec-
essary cause (in the scientiﬁc sense) in the occurrence of trafﬁc accidents. But the
“normal” driving speed is also simultaneously a component of the current understanding
of the “road trafﬁc system” and indeed largely deﬁnes it in some parts. The image of
today’s road appears decidedly risky in individual cases: It is therefore appropriate to
question whether in individual situations—for example when driving past a pedestrian—a
risk exists [16] that could be adapted to address existing accident risks in road trafﬁc.
25.5.2.4
“Dilemma Situations” Against the Backdrop of Fundamental
Rights
The legal evaluation of “dilemma situations” should take its starting point in the over-
arching legal framework, the fundamental rights. In the area of fundamental right to life
and physical integrity nothing of fundamental signiﬁcance changes due to the transition
from human vehicle control to automated agency. In particular, it does not give rise to a
“targeted” intervention in life or physical integrity, which in light of the importance of
these objects of legal protection as the highest value and their fundamental signiﬁcance
would be impossible to justify for all practical purposes [3]. While every control decision
is predetermined under particular external conditions by the programming of the
respective system and thus is not random, as will need to be discussed in the context of
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
535
product liability as well, this does not in fact represent the speciﬁcation of a particular
course of action. Rather, the programming of an automated driving function (only)
speciﬁes which factors should be taken into account so that among multiple alternatives,
the one which completely avoids damage, if possible, or causes the least damage, can be
selected. It is particularly this situation-dependent consideration of alternative courses of
action which represents the decisive added value of automated vehicle control, which was
described as “Expansion of the scope of inﬂuence” through automated control in
Sect. 25.5.2.1. Thus in the context of programming, no actual control decisions are made,
but (only) abstract criteria for control decisions in individual cases speciﬁed. This illus-
trates that ultimately it is still an abstract risk that is posed by automated control in road
trafﬁc. In terms of the fundamental rights, automated control would therefore not be
handled differently than human vehicle control, which poses the risks presented in
Sect. 25.3. Thus the associated unintentional damages to objects of protection (see [3])
which are equally caused by accidents under automated control in road trafﬁc where an
automation risk is assumed (see Sect. 25.5.1) should not be evaluated any differently than
current risks in road trafﬁc from the standpoint of the fundamental right to life and
physical integrity.
One aspect, however, should be given particular attention from a fundamental rights
perspective: If it emerges that automated perception of the environment is sufﬁcient to
recognize non-motorized trafﬁc participants (pedestrians and bicyclists) as such, their
protection would have to be given particular weight in the action variants established to
handle such situations (see the argumentation in Sect. 25.3).
The decision dilemma described by the term “dilemma situation” between two
equivalent objects of legal protection cannot be resolved, however, against the backdrop
of the fundamental right to life and physical integrity: any trade-off between two equiv-
alent values or, with regard to life, “absolute” fundamental right of other fundamental
rights-bearers in terms of constitutional protection [3] is absolutely impermissible. From a
legal standpoint, therefore—if one assumes the actual existence of such “dilemma situ-
ations” in reality—there can be no contribution in the sense of a decision ﬂowing from the
current state of the fundamental rights dogma; rather, a novel question in need of an
answer would be raised. It would therefore be of some importance to clarify the question
of whether “dilemma situations” actually occur in this manner, and in particular whether
the relevant cause of their occurrence can actually be traced back to the automated control
decision and not to some inherent risk within the “road trafﬁc system”—for example due
to the driving speeds in certain situations (see also Sect. 25.5.2.3). If it emerged that
“dilemma situations” exist and that their relevant cause resides in automated control, it
would be essential to make this question transparent and—presuming societal acceptance
of an automation risk—conduct a debate about it. It would presumably be necessary to
create a catalog of recognized decision criteria for such situations.
In all of this it would be essential to bear in mind that the question only arises in the
ﬁrst place through the expansion of the scope of intervention (see Sect. 25.5.2.1), which in
most cases without a “dilemma” would lead to an improvement over the current situation.
536
T.M. Gasser
The scientiﬁc comparison of the automated decision dilemma with the driver of today will
in all likelihood demonstrate that in otherwise identical situations, the driver is not
regarded as culpable, not least in consideration of the moment of shock accorded to the
driver (see [14]). There is likewise no distinction between the scenarios with regard to
“dilemma situations” in that damage occurs in either case. The reason for addressing the
question would thus be due to the decidedly welcome development that technological
advancements had made it possible to inﬂuence such situations and thus to save acutely
endangered objects of legal protection. The weight of this argument will presumably carry
the day in the end.
25.5.3 Possibility of Override by Passengers
The question of an override possibility of vehicles results from past discussions on driver
assistance systems, which in large part draws on the concrete formulations of the Vienna
Convention on Road Trafﬁc of 1968 [17], which is still valid as of this writing (August
2014). Although this was not speciﬁcally mentioned, the underlying thought is neverthe-
less related to the question as to the duties of the driver in case of fully-automated vehicle
control, which with respect to the applicable law in Germany has been described as
contradictory [10]. The context can be described in terms of the concept of “dominance” or
“authority”, which was taken as a basis in the “use cases” discussed in the present project
(see Chap. 2). All four representative use cases envision a role for the driver or passenger in
vehicle control, which diminishes as the scope of autonomy rises since other factors must
be given precedence in the context of functional implementation. Even the representative
use case examined here with the lowest degree of autonomy, the “Interstate Pilot Using
Driver for Extended Availability” use case envisions that the driver “becomes a mere
passenger during autonomous driving” such that he/she “[can] pursue another activity”.
Thus even here there is a complete lack of a basis for an override capability at any time,
which from the outset has always been regarded as factually (and not just technically)
necessary. The factual override possibility by the driver was a reformulation of the initially
uncontroversial “ﬁnal decision authority of the driver” in driver assistance systems. This
represented the subordinate role of driver assistance systems vis-à-vis the driver in vehicle
control, where the system was regarded as having only a derivative authority to act and take
decisions (see Sect. 25.4.1). Autonomous vehicles call this entire situation into question,
such that it seems inadvisable to derive interpretations for future application from regu-
lations that assume a human driver is taking part in vehicle control. This fundamental shift
to independent automated action is already described in Sect. 25.4.2.
With regard to fundamental rights, however, one aspect does bear a brief mention: The
liberties of passengers of autonomous vehicles speciﬁed in art. 2 of the German Funda-
mental Law provide an overall framework which—to the extent relevant in the present
case—applies in particular to the right to personal mobility and personal freedom (see [3]).
The limitations on these liberties resulting from autonomous vehicles do not seem as of
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
537
this writing to have been fundamentally called into question, as long as the passengers
always have the possibility of causing the vehicle to stop at the nearest safe and appro-
priate location.
25.5.4 Error Compensation Capability in Autonomous Driving
A “basic presumption” of the present project is that the use cases are deployed at the
considered time in a mixed operation of transportation systems with different levels of
automation ... ranging from “driver-only” to “assisted” to “fully automated” (see Chap. 2).
This leads to the requirement that autonomous vehicles integrate in the existing trafﬁc
system.
In the case of conventional vehicle control, as in the case of currently available driver
assistance systems (in the broadest sense), which never enjoy actual autonomy (see
Sect. 25.4.1), the German road trafﬁc regulations (StVO) are applicable without exception.
Drivers thus ﬁnd themselves confronted with conﬂicting priorities of the “principle of trust”
and “defensive driving”. The “Principle of Trust” means that properly behaving trafﬁc
participants under normal circumstances do not need to take all possible (rare) trafﬁc vio-
lations by others into account as a preventive measure. The “Principle of Trust” is necessary
to maintain trafﬁc ﬂow. At the same time, the driver is called upon to “drive defensively” (to
contribute to trafﬁc safety) and thus apply more than the prescribed care (which in fact
means partially hedging one’s trust in the proper trafﬁc behavior of other drivers) without
this “fundamentally” undermining the principle of legitimate expectation [14]. Just how
these requirements are understood in individual cases, could be inferred from court rulings
in Germany. However, the continental European norm of systematized statutory law can
provide but a degree of orientation in this regard, but no precedence for individual cases,
which ultimately means that the value of any such aggregation of rulings is limited.
It must therefore ultimately be required of “mixed operation” vehicles that they meet
(at least) the same standards required of drivers in order to ensure that they do not, at the
minimum, cause any new hazards. In a precise description of the requirements on an error
compensation capability, it must be noted that a signiﬁcant degree of imprecision remains.
If one translates the current legal requirements in road trafﬁc into a deﬁnition of the
capabilities required of an autonomous control function, it can only be asserted with
sufﬁcient certainty that autonomous vehicles must absolutely have error compensation
capabilities. Autonomous vehicles would have to be able to take clearly identiﬁable
inappropriate behavior by other trafﬁc participants into account and adapt the automated
control accordingly. According to current law, how this is achieved is left up to the
judgment of the driver in individual cases. Just implementing this requirement alone from
a technical standpoint would require an extremely sophisticated environment recognition
capability and extremely complex decision-making processes; but these are—including in
the case of the driver—not speciﬁcally deﬁned, but rather taken as given in the context of
the requisite suitability and permission to drive [18]. This lack of speciﬁcity concerning
538
T.M. Gasser
the requirements could therefore prove too difﬁcult for implementation in the form of an
automated control system.
In light of the uncertainty resulting from the antagonistic demand of “defensive driving”,
the only remaining option at this point is the—potentially trafﬁc-ﬂow-compromising—
overfulﬁllment of the error compensation capability to the extent of total risk exclusion.
This leaves the question, however, of whether a signiﬁcant restriction of the trafﬁc ﬂow
would indeed be expected: due to the aforementioned expanded scope of intervention of
automated control (see Sect. 25.5.2), automated vehicle control could actually prove much
more capable than a human driver. This advantage, which is presently unmeasurable, could
compensate for deﬁcits in terms of trafﬁc ﬂow (although the resulting scope is equally
unknown).
In the question of the error compensation capabilities of autonomous automated control
systems, it could prove beneﬁcial to the cause of legal certainty to formulate uniform
requirements targeted to speciﬁc objectives (comparable to brake effectiveness standards
for vehicles, for example) that deﬁne and harmonize the state of the science and tech-
nology. Such a catalog of requirements would presumably bear fruit in the legal deﬁnition
of realistic capability requirements for autonomous control systems.
25.5.5 Communication in Road Traffic
As concerns communication, for road trafﬁc the currently existing options can be assumed.
The use of some vehicle-based light and audible signals—such as headlight ﬂashers, turn
signals and hazard warning lights—if present, is explicitly prescribed by the German Road
Trafﬁc regulations. For example, warning signals (use of the hazard warning light) are
prescribed in the case of hazards with school buses, when passengers get in or out, or as a
warning when approaching the end of a trafﬁc jam, with stalled cars and cars being towed
[see also sections 15, 15a, 16 of the road trafﬁc regulations (StVO)]. Section 5 paragraphs
4a and 5 of the road trafﬁc regulations (StVO) prescribe and allow the use of turn signals
and headlight ﬂashers, respectively, in the context of overtaking maneuvers. The use of
turn signals is prescribed, if available on the vehicle, when turning [section 9 paragraph 1
of the road trafﬁc regulations (StVO)] or starting up [section 10 of the road trafﬁc regu-
lations (StVO)]. Through this standardized, formalized communication, the road trafﬁc
regulations achieve simpliﬁed expectations among other trafﬁc participants [19].
Alongside this, an informal (or not legally secured) use of (light) signals has established
itself which, however, is not envisioned by the road trafﬁc regulations (ﬂashing the high
beams, for instance, can also represent ceding the right of way to another driver in Germany).
It should be noted, however, that such a use of the signals is no longer subject to the principle
of legitimate expectation in road trafﬁc because it cannot be regarded as “trafﬁc-appropriate”
behavior (and, incidentally, also represents a major risk for misinterpretation).
Immediate verbal communication from within closed vehicles in road trafﬁc is rendered
more difﬁcult or even impossible due to the physical separation of the driver from the
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
539
immediate environment and the noise level of the surroundings. Even informal commu-
nication through simple gestures is considerably compromised due to the reﬂective effects
of today’s typically tinted and angled vehicle windows. Nevertheless, even the road trafﬁc
regulations offer up an application in the case of “special trafﬁc situations,” which
envisions unspeciﬁed informal communication [as a special legal variant of the duty of
care and consideration in section 1 paragraph 1 of the road trafﬁc regulations (StVO)]. For
instance, if it is necessary to cede the right of way, this requires communication with the
driver yielding the right of way as per section 11 paragraph 3 of the road trafﬁc regulations
(StVO), providing that this communication is conducted in an unambiguous manner—in
exceptional circumstances, even ﬂashing the high beams can thereby be used to further
clarify intent [14].
In view of existing communication challenges (see also Chap. 7), beforehand action, in
particular when expressed in the form of motion, can also represent an indication of the
intended target actions [19], such that the road trafﬁc behavior which can be perceived
from the outside such as stopping, braking and starting up also attain major signiﬁcance in
the context of informal communication. Such conduct is also explicitly envisioned by
section 8, paragraph 2 of the road trafﬁc regulations (StVO), which speciﬁes that in
right-of-way situations, the party required to wait shall “indicate through driving behavior
that he/she will wait.”
Aside from the nonverbal nature and anonymity, the complexity of the situation is also
singled out as a characteristic marginal condition for communication in road trafﬁc. This
complexity is particularly determined by the speed and ﬂeeting nature of the communi-
cation in road trafﬁc [20].
This enables us to identify some initial important conclusions for autonomous driving:
While standardized, formal communication may represent merely a challenge for machine
perception and interpretation and may indeed be possible to program automatically in the
other direction, the question arises at this point already as to the degree to which other
drivers can only recognize automated control or how this could be implemented. Con-
sequently, in the “mixed” communication relationship with machines, the question further
arises whether other drivers would trust the contents of formal communication. This
would at least predicate knowledge of the respective capabilities of autonomous vehicles
in order to allow communicative interaction to function. The case could even arise that
other trafﬁc participants feel a need to reproduce the content of automated communication
(for example after an accident) in order to develop a willingness to trust in
machine-generated communication content.
While the resulting challenges in the case of formal communication appear amenable to
resolution, informal communication in mixed operation is characterized by much greater
challenges [mixed operation is the basis of the present examination (see Chap. 2)]. In this
area there is a need to ﬁnd approaches which would establish a bridge between
machine-controlled vehicles and other trafﬁc participants. Ultimately this conﬂict ﬂows
from the cause already described in Sect. 25.5, namely that detailed situation-speciﬁc
regulation of communication between human drivers in road trafﬁc is not strictly
540
T.M. Gasser
necessary and that implementation can be left to the trafﬁc participants according to
situation. This informal communication between trafﬁc participants may be subject to
conﬂicts and in need of improvement [20], yet it can still be presumed that drivers are
generally able to resolve this challenge in all situations—not least as this is necessary to
guarantee the situation-speciﬁc adjustment that is required for road trafﬁc in the ﬁrst place.
With the introduction of automated vehicle control, the machines would lack this
human-speciﬁc capability of achieving understanding though such unspeciﬁed means;
indeed, the machine may lack even the capability of recognizing that such communication
is called for. The prerequisite for human communication is establishing a reﬂexive
attentiveness to the communication partner and mutual perception [19]. This illustrates
clearly that “mixed” communication still requires fundamental approaches for bridging
this communication gap with machines. This would have to be a fundamental prerequisite
in order for a mixed road trafﬁc scenario including human drivers and machine-controlled
vehicles to function.
At the same time, the importance of communication for the implementation of auton-
omous driving can be rated according to how important informal communication proves in
a given situation—an apparently very challenging task from a technical standpoint. The
abovementioned speed and ﬂeeting character of communication in road trafﬁc would
presumably differ signiﬁcantly based on the environmental conditions and driving speeds.
Simply structured, extremely ﬂeeting environmental conditions such as on a highway,
where the driving speeds generally require formal communication, could substantially
simplify the implementation of autonomous driving in that context and minimize the
apparent necessity of adapting autonomous vehicles to the requirements of informal
communication
(in
comparison
to
communication
needed
for
an
urban
trafﬁc
environment).
It may also be assumed that the challenge posed by communication will only occur in
mixed trafﬁc because, particularly between autonomous machines, the problem seems
eminently manageable from a technical standpoint (via cooperative systems). Moreover,
for mixed trafﬁc the signiﬁcance of beforehand action expressed in motion, and how it can
be used for future communication in road trafﬁc, must also be examined. Of particular
interest is the question which situations can be unambiguously resolved by it. At the same
time, there is the risk that an automated driving system—with a set-up designed to take
full account of the error compensation capabilities of other trafﬁc participants (see
Sect. 25.5.4)—could indirectly compromise trafﬁc ﬂow if its conﬁguration were taken
advantage of by other trafﬁc participants.
Finally, it may be concluded with regard to communication in road trafﬁc that here, too,
a catalog of technically implementable communication strategies for autonomous vehicles
in the form of a catalog of requirements would be advisable as soon as technical feasibility
is foreseeable. This summarization of the technical features required of autonomous
vehicles with regard to communication will be necessary over the long term, particularly
in mixed trafﬁc, and could substantially advance the discussion on possible communi-
cation concepts.
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
541
25.5.6 Violations
Through section 24 of the Road Trafﬁc Act as a blanket provision in conjunction with the
regulatory offenses speciﬁed by the road trafﬁc regulations (StVO, section 49), the vehicle
registration regulations (FZV, section 48), the road trafﬁc licensing regulations (StVZO,
section 69a) and driver licensing regulations (FeV, section 75), violations of prohibitions,
duties and orders are generally prosecuted against trafﬁc participants and vehicle owners
[14]. Punishable offenses also include road trafﬁc-related violations from the 28th section
of the criminal code (StGB) on offenses dangerous to public safety (noteworthy in the
present context are external interventions in road trafﬁc as per section 315b StGB and
hazards in road trafﬁc as per section 315c StGB). It is evident that the machine-controlled
conduct of autonomous vehicles would obviate the application of these provisions:
Regulatory offenses and criminal provisions are always linked to a human action, which is
lacking in the autonomous scenario.
The existing regulations, which carry penalties under criminal law or as regulatory
offenses, also have an indicative effect concerning what behavior in road trafﬁc not only
impacts public order, but may, in line with our focus here, especially compromise public
safety. The trafﬁc regulations are “to be handled and interpreted in an elastic
(trafﬁc-appropriate) manner and without pettiness;” this applies equally, in the case of
special regulations, to those which may impede or endanger [14]. Moreover, section 16 of
the law on regulatory offenses provides a standard for legitimate emergency, which
permits actions contrary to the law, including trafﬁc regulations, in cases of acute danger
to life, limb, property or other objects under legal protection in order to prevent imminent
harm. The dangers must be grave, however, and the defensive actions commensurate to
the dangers. Although the respective cases must be handled in a restrictive manner, not
least to prevent specious assertions, this is ultimately a normative instrument to enable an
appropriate consideration of the interests of different objects of legal protection in indi-
vidual cases in a consistent and thus constitutional manner. The violation itself is subject
to the same standard, such that its most extreme limit for road trafﬁc is ultimately deﬁned
by the “danger threshold” for other trafﬁc participants (see [21] on the question of the
consideration of trafﬁc safety in the context of the defense of necessity as a justiﬁcation as
per section 16 of the law on regulatory offenses).
If the introduction of autonomous driving is taken into account against this backdrop, it
may be assumed that the interests would remain unchanged—at least for the mixed trafﬁc
scenario of autonomous and driver-controlled vehicles on which this study is based (see
Chap. 2). A change could occur if—due to a very high degree of automated-system
mastery of the automated control risk associated with a violation—the described con-
sideration ﬁnds that the violation does not result in an increased risk. This would, of
course, call into question the very rationale for the rule itself: “Violation” of the rule
would then not actually produce any disadvantage in the context of mixed trafﬁc.
It is also conceivable, however, that autonomous driving will lead to a need for
considerably more detailed trafﬁc rules which are signiﬁcantly less ﬂexible (which would
542
T.M. Gasser
in turn raise the question of societal acceptance again). Such a restriction of the existing
situation would in turn require a more detailed catalog of requirements in terms of the
technical control capability of autonomous vehicles as soon as they become foreseeable
from a technical standpoint. This would make it possible to identify consequences,
including in the case of violations, in much greater detail than is currently possible.
25.6
Special Legal Questions Related to Autonomous Driving
As regards the evaluation of fully-automated, driverless driving in terms of legal regu-
lations and product as well as road trafﬁc liability, the introductory passages on these
issues can be referred to (see Sect. 25.4.2 as well as the introduction to Sect. 25.5). In
summary, the principal conclusion we may draw in this regard is that the legal regulations
and trafﬁc law provisions [in particular the road trafﬁc act (StVG), road trafﬁc regulations
(StVO), road trafﬁc licensing regulations (FeV) and the regulations authorizing the use of
vehicles for road trafﬁc (StVZO)] at the time of their establishment could only consider as
objects of regulation what was known in terms of the state of technology in road trafﬁc. In
all aspects of public road trafﬁc, there is an underlying presumption that a driver will
personally perform vehicle control. It is accordingly true of all available systems that they
do not possess an independent decision-making quality (see Sect. 25.4.1), but indeed
require that the driver be at least “an active monitor” at all times.
25.6.1 Legal Assessment of Driverless Vehicles
If the legal assessment of fully-automated driving [10] is therefore further extended to
completely unmanned vehicles and passengers who are not able to control the vehicles
themselves, clearly there would initially be no change in the present incompatibility with
current regulatory law, which does not take account of this technological development.
At the same time, it must be noted that driverless and completely autonomous vehicles
(see the representative use cases “Autonomous Valet Parking” and “Vehicle on Demand”
in Chap. 2) differ signiﬁcantly in the requirements for the legal framework from those
which call for an “available driver”. With the continued option of vehicle control by the
driver for certain sections of a trip or due to a desire on the driver’s part to take control, the
same fundamental requirements (suitability and competence to drive; see also [18]) must
be fulﬁlled that are currently required of drivers—in the case of “Full Automation Using
Driver for Extended Availability,” at least when the driver intends to make use of the
possibility of controlling the vehicle (i.e. perform an independent act of driving). As such,
there is no need for a fundamentally different legal framework, but simply one augmented
by necessary regulations governing autonomous vehicles and thus an independent,
machine-based decision-making quality. With regard to this independent, machine-based
decision-making quality, then, one arrives at the same result from a legal perspective for
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
543
all of the use cases. The transformation resides primarily in enabling independent, auto-
mated agency and how that is shaped. The framework for automated vehicle control from
a legal standpoint is currently unregulated, although regulation seems called for (at least in
the spirit of road trafﬁc regulations as technically effective regulation).
Insofar as a need for regulation of autonomous vehicles does not emerge naturally from
the novel machine-based automation risk (see Sect. 25.5.1), it would seem that at least in
terms of the use of suitable functions in mixed trafﬁc relating to error compensation (see
Sect. 25.5.4) and communication capabilities (see Sect. 25.5.5) of autonomous vehicles, a
need for legal regulation seems evident. In the legal regulation of such interactive
behavior, it must be examined precisely how far the role of the driver even extends in
individual cases. If one considers the technical capabilities resulting from solely
machine-based mobility in a given case (as described in the “Full Automation Using
Driver for Extended Availability” and “Vehicle On Demand” use cases), the heretofore
fundamental requirements of a driver’s driving suitability and driving competence already
appear superﬂuous. The manifold possibilities could therefore give rise to an unprece-
dented variety of regulatory duties for participation in road trafﬁc with (autonomous)
vehicles, which could be distinguished primarily by the reach of the automated control
quality and to what extent it is intended to be used.
25.6.2 Evaluation of Autonomous Driving According to Liability
Law in Road Traffic
As concerns the shift towards automated agency which is associated with autonomous
driving, it is likewise the case with road trafﬁc liability law that the existing regulations do
not take account of this change.
25.6.2.1
Keeper Liability
Nevertheless there is in this area a fundamental German liability regulation for motor
vehicles [section 7 of the road trafﬁc act (StVG)] according to which the keeper of the
vehicle, regardless of fault in the operation of the vehicle, is liable for compensation of all
causally related damages which are not asset damages [where the only remaining reason for
exclusion of liability is force majeure, section 7 paragraph 2 of the road trafﬁc act (StVG)].
Thus even today, this restriction to operation of the vehicle as a liability-triggering legal
deﬁnition does not make a distinction based on whether damage was caused by the driver’s
conduct or due to technical failure. Since automated control decisions which cause damage
can without contradiction be classiﬁed as technical failures, there is no fundamental
inconsistency in this regard.
The vehicle keeper is the person who uses the vehicle for his or her own account, in
particular who draws the beneﬁts and pays its expenses and thus also has the authority to
decide regarding its use as a potential source of hazard [14]. If one assumes that driverless
vehicles, too, can be assigned to a keeper, which would be possible without inconsistency
544
T.M. Gasser
according to current law, no incompatibility with current law would arise in this case.
Autonomous driving would nevertheless change the matter of keeper responsibility—
however, the keeper responsibility for autonomous driving is already covered by the
wording of the applicable regulation today: The vehicle control previously conducted by
the driver is replaced by an automated vehicle control system (as far as the scope of
application of the respective autonomous control reaches). Concerning the keeper
responsibility, therefore, there would be no new duties, but rather a completely different
control quality which triggers civil liability.
25.6.2.2
Driver Liability and Accident Data Recording
Other regulations of the road trafﬁc act which are relevant for civil liability do, however,
clearly assume control by a driver, for example section 18 paragraph 1 of the road trafﬁc
act (StVG), according to which in cases of keeper liability a liability on the part of the
driver is likewise presumed (see clause 2). Thus we see that section 18 of the German road
trafﬁc act (StVG) also merely assumes the heretofore always correct presumption that a
driver is always responsible for the control behavior of the vehicle. Ultimately the
assessment of driverless vehicles from a liability law perspective does not differ sub-
stantially from fully-automated [10] vehicles. The situation is similar with the heretofore
applicable provisions of the German Civil Code (BGB) covering unlawful behavior by
drivers (e.g. section 823 paragraph 1 BGB or section 823 paragraph 2 BGB in conjunction
with violations of the road trafﬁc regulations): These provisions can no longer cover the
case of automated agency because they are linked to human action which is not applicable
to autonomous vehicles.
In the autonomous vehicles which are the subject of this study, which in some cases do
not even require the presence or occasional assumption of control by a driver, the question
must be addressed to what extent it may be assumed in a typical case that vehicle pas-
sengers will be capable of describing the course of an accident. This illustrates that with
respect to the question of compensation of accident damages occurring between two or
more autonomous vehicles, the apportionment of damages according to applicable law and
thus section 17 of the road trafﬁc act (StVG) is confronted with the problem that the
principally applied “degree of causation” [14] no longer—as is commonly the case today—
can at least be supported through hearing of the drivers (generally also parties to a civil case
—as the case may be also witnesses). This is due primarily to the role change in which the
driver becomes a “mere passenger” (see Chap. 2) and is therefore able to make statements
regarding the course of an accident only in exceptional cases and only on the basis of
chance observations. Thus a change is introduced which even with respect to liability law
in road trafﬁc would seem to require technical measures (such as crash data recording
during automated vehicle control) as a basis for the corresponding damage apportionment,
insofar as the desire exists to maintain this distribution principle according to shares of
causation for autonomous driving as well (which does indeed seem possible).
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
545
25.6.3 Evaluation with Respect to Product Liability Law
The ﬁeld of product liability for automated control of autonomous vehicles was already
discussed in Sect. 25.5.1. The salient question here is determination of the relevant cause
of accident damage in individual cases in the sense of scientiﬁc causality.
25.6.3.1
Significance of Accident Data Recordings in Autonomous
Driving in Terms of Product Liability Law
Going further, for the cases of autonomous driving which require a “driver for extended
availability” (see the use cases “Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability”
and “Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability” Chap. 2) there is another
aspect which in turn stands in relation to the question of crash data recorders. Both in
terms of product liability law (as well as with regard to violations of regulatory law subject
to ﬁnes) it seems reasonable to assume that an active available driver could argue the
exculpatory defense that he/she was not controlling the vehicle him/herself, but with the
aid of the autonomous control system. If one wishes to preclude such assertions, it will be
difﬁcult to avoid considering the recording of vehicle control data—at least during
autonomous control—in order both to protect the interests of the manufacturers in terms of
product liability law and to secure evidence with respect to regulatory violations. This
option does not seem excluded a priori from a data protection standpoint provided that the
data remains in the vehicle, the transparency requirement is granted and data processing is
conducted only to the extent necessary, or that data is, for example, only permanently
stored in the event of accident damage. Moreover, a restriction of data recording to the
period in which the vehicle was under automated control would have to be considered
which would meet the principle of data minimization [section 3 of the German Data
Protection Act (BDSG)], which incidentally would equally arise from the principle of
proportionality with regard to data processing. This would also largely avoid the recording
of behavior related data on the driver’s control of the vehicle. Particular attention would
also have to be given to the transitions between the respective periods in which the driver
and the automated control system are driving. Data recording could be of particular
importance in this transition period, although it would simultaneously deal with data
clearly related to the driver. As such, it would be necessary to clarify in an initial step the
extent of recording required for a driver-controlled drive to protect against subsequent
exculpatory defenses.
25.6.3.2
The State of Science and Technology in Autonomous Driving
From a product liability law perspective, the signiﬁcant aspect for the layman would
appear to be the question of exclusion of liability for errors in the context of automated
vehicle control which the latest science and technology cannot identify at the time of
introduction (development risk). In this context of product liability law, we must return to
the question raised in Sect. 25.5.1 in which it appears possible in the context of road trafﬁc
that risks which manifest themselves in accidents could also be traced back to the current
546
T.M. Gasser
trafﬁc system as a relevant cause (and not in all cases to the control behavior, whether by
drivers or automated control systems). This question is fundamental and needs to be
answered as a matter of priority in order to avoid erroneously inferring that (alleged)
product defects are the relevant cause.
But as soon as the grounds for exemption from liability are affected in view of the state
of science and technology, it must be taken into account that this exemption in practice is
of decidedly minor signiﬁcance. Whether a hazard was indeed recognizable according to
the state of science and technology is to be tested in two steps: First, it must be established
whether the error was recognizable for any scientist or engineer in the world. If that was
the case, claiming the exemption is still not yet ruled out, because the decisive factor
would be the objective accessibility of that knowledge for the manufacturer. It would also
be necessary to take into consideration deviating opinions by individual scientists, pro-
vided that those opinions satisfy the minimum requirements for scientiﬁc work [22].
As such, it is equally critical to determine for autonomous vehicles whether the rec-
ognizability of an error could indeed be ruled out at the time of introduction (which indeed
would also have to be provable in retrospect in the event of an accident according to the
applicable standards of presentation and proof in civil suits). Only in this rare case would
the manufacturer gain legal certainty through the use of these grounds for exemption of
the development risk [and if not at fault, also according to section 823 paragraph 1 of the
German Civil Code (BGB)]. In practice, this case will be of nearly no importance.
Cognizance of the fact that product defects cannot be entirely ruled out even according
to the latest science and technology and the observance of all due care, i.e. that a “residual
fault tolerance”—as the ISO 26262 standard words it—exists, must be regarded as a
technical description of the development process which has no correlation in product
liability law.
25.6.4 Possible Differences of Legal Evaluation
in the International Context
First, it must be noted that the present chapter from the outset only considers the situation
from the perspective of German law and makes assertions on the basis of German law
currently in force. Applicability to other countries must be considered limited. Transfer-
ability of the conclusions here will, aside from coincidental reasons, be most likely in the
event of harmonization of laws due to international agreements (in the context of inter-
national law) or through regulations and directives issued in the context of EU law.
It is therefore salient to add that, as concerns the fundamental rights situation depicted
here, there is a largely concordant standard of fundamental rights—for our present pur-
poses in the context of the German fundamental rights to life and physical integrity—
recognized for example through the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. It
bears references to the European Convention on Human Rights and, with the exception of
the United Kingdom and Poland, the EU fundamental rights charter was declared binding
25
Fundamental and Special Legal Questions for Autonomous Vehicles
547
for the countries of the European Union through a provision in the Treaty of Lisbon. The
rights to life and physical integrity are explicitly recognized therein—in particular through
article 2 paragraph 1 and article 3 paragraph 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union (see also [23]). This interpretation could be extended almost at will to the
constitutions of other states; the chief conclusion, however, is that the fundamental rights
framework can differ signiﬁcantly in many individual areas. Such an examination is
therefore the realm of specialists in the respective legal contexts.
This applies equally to the regulatory law of road trafﬁc as well as to the liability law
being applied which is relevant for autonomous driving. But as we have seen in
Sects. 25.6.1 and 25.6.2, the legal situation according to German law is to a great extent
only transferable to autonomous driving to a very limited degree. It seems quite possible
that a comparable situation would subsist in other legal systems as well. This assumption
is also supported by the fact that international road trafﬁc accords such as the Vienna
Convention on Road Trafﬁc of 1968 and the Geneva Convention on Road Trafﬁc of 1949
are based on a deﬁnition of the driver and continuous vehicle control which is highly
comparable to that of the German road trafﬁc regulations.
In the interest of greater comparability, the product liability law which was harmonized
within the European Union through council directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 rates a
mention. Here again, in addition to restrictions in terms of legal doctrine, uncertainties
arise due to the fact that the directive’s implementation is binding only with regard to the
objective (a principle that existed even prior to the current situation and which ﬁnds
expression today in article 288 paragraph of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Euro-
pean Union). Yet there is a comparable legal foundation for intra-state application which
is not linked to culpability (so-called strict liability).
In sum, it can be concluded that in these areas, there are still signiﬁcant differences
which could impact the development of autonomous driving. Due to the national variations
within the ﬁeld of law, however, the impact cannot be predicted in detail and remains—as
far as can be ascertained today—in need of further examination.
25.6.5 Special Question: Supervisory Duty with Regard
to the Passengers of Autonomous Vehicles
One of the beneﬁts of autonomous driving is that the attention resources of the human
occupant are no longer required for the task of driving. This could potentially call into
question the necessity of the presence of the “driver,” or indeed the person with a supervisory
duty at all. Thus a signiﬁcant beneﬁt of autonomous driving could be that the mobility desires
of children—without requiring a driver—could be fulﬁlled. It is therefore by no means
impossible that dangers could arise from this if—as presumably would often be the case—
the driver is the person with a supervisory duty who is no longer present in the vehicle.
However, of the representative use cases examined here, only the “vehicle on demand”
case would appear suitable for performing such a transport activity without the
548
T.M. Gasser
accompaniment of a person with a supervisory duty. Even the representative use case
“Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability” calls for the presence of a
driver to drive in zones or sections of roads not approved for autonomous driving (see
Chap. 2). Since the “Vehicle on Demand” representative use case does not even have a
driver’s seat (but only a completely freely-usable interior space), dangers and effects
ﬂowing from use by persons requiring supervision would seem to be limited to the interior
of the vehicle and not relevant for road trafﬁc. Thus the question of the absence of the
person with the supervisory duty would not be relevant for road trafﬁc. It is, however,
every bit as plausible that such autonomous vehicles would indeed have driving controls.
In that case there would be the possibility of a signiﬁcant negative inﬂuence over vehicle
control by means of overriding the autonomous driving functions through the control
elements.
It is clear, however, that the legal question of a duty to supervise does not depend on
the introduction of autonomous driving. Indeed, even today independent compensation
obligations can be triggered by violations of the duty to supervise [see section 832 of the
German Civil Code (BGB)]. The law stipulates a parental duty to supervise children in the
exercise of parental care, sections 1626 and following BGB. Thus it would be necessary to
determine the intensity of supervision required in view of the predictability of damaging
conduct in an individual case based on the age, maturity, character, knowledge and
abilities of a child [24]. If the resulting duty is violated and damage occurs on account of
it, an independent claim for damages (aside from any claims lodged against the child)
could be leveled against the parents of the child as well. Thus the possibilities arising from
the advent of autonomous vehicles could result in the correct fulﬁllment of supervisory
duties in this context receiving a novel, heretofore completely unknown meaning. A need
to alter the legal basis is not foreseeable, however.
25.7
Conclusion
The examination of autonomous driving from a legal perspective undertaken in the pre-
sent chapter reveals—in addition to the questions raised in the respective subsections—in
particular a fundamental aspect which may take on greater prominence in the context of
the transition from human to automated vehicle control than was previously the case. Even
if we were to assume today that every accident involving motor vehicles were due to faults
in the control of the vehicle, it must be examined scientiﬁcally to what extent the current
trafﬁc system, in view of the conditions under which it operates, does not itself represent a
relevant cause for some portion of the accidents which take place today. The answer to the
question is not to be regarded as an end in itself, but as a means of understanding whether,
and if so, which changes in the vehicle control scenario are suitable under certain con-
ditions to prevent accidents. This question is also decisive for the design of a safe product
from the manufacturer’s point of view in terms of developing appropriate autonomous
machine-based control functions.

It would also appear that the description of an automated control quality in the sense of
a deﬁnition of requirements will be an important milestone in the ongoing advancement of
autonomous driving in terms of legal certainty both for the operator of the vehicles as well
as their manufacturers. This could be the basis for an evaluation that determines precisely
in which areas there is a need for further development such as the communication or error
compensation capabilities of autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, it would allow for
an assessment of how the corresponding legal framework must be designed in order to
make a functioning “road trafﬁc system” involving autonomous vehicles a reality.

Product Liability Issues in the U.S.
and Associated Risk Management

Introduction
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold the promise of saving tens of thousands of lives each
year in the U.S., and many more worldwide, reducing trafﬁc, saving energy, and providing
mobility to those who cannot drive conventional cars. Nonetheless, AVs will inevitably
have some accidents. On balance, AVs are likely to prevent many more accidents than
they cause, but there will be at least some accidents involving AVs that would not have
occurred with conventional vehicles.
Because of accidents involving AVs, some of which may be catastrophic, product
liability litigation1 is inevitable, especially in cases where conventional vehicles would not
have crashed. The threat of massive product liability litigation involving AVs is widely
perceived as one of the chief obstacles to AV development and sales, if not the number
one threat [3].2 Some believe that product liability suits are an existential threat to
autonomous driving [33].3 Crippling suits could force manufacturers to exit the market
and may deter some manufacturers from entering the market because of a belief that the
sales are not worth the risk. If these dire predictions come to pass, the U.S. and other parts

1This chapter focuses mainly on product liability litigation, although there are also requirements to
compel vehicle manufacturers to recall their vehicles to ﬁx defects. The management of liability and
recall risks overlap and the risk management principles discussed in this chapter apply to both.
2“Some of the largest obstacles to autonomous consumer vehicles are the legalities [2].” Reports
from Lloyd’s of London and the University of Texas listed product liability as among the top
obstacles for AVs [21, 30].
3“[T]he worst outcome would be that said liability isn’t sorted out so that we never do get the mass
manufacturing and adoption of driverless cars” [33].

of the world experiencing a ﬂood of lawsuits may lose the use of a technology that would
save many times more lives than it would endanger. If, however, the industry ﬁnds
effective ways to manage the risk of product liability, it can bring to market a lifesaving
technology while maintaining practices to minimize accidents and resulting liability, as
well as the proﬁtability needed to offer AVs in the market over time.
The purpose of this chapter is to identify product liability risks in the U.S. to manu-
facturers of AVs, the source of those risks, and how manufacturers can manage those risks.
A focus on U.S. product liability is important from a worldwide manufacturer’s per-
spective given the size of the U.S. market and the perception that the U.S. is a litigious
country. Product liability is perceived as a greater threat in the U.S. than in any other
country of the world. Section 26.2 discusses the circumstances giving rise to U.S. product
liability litigation and the phenomenon of some U.S. cases resulting in huge awards to
plaintiffs seeking compensation. It explains why these huge awards occur. Section 26.3
analyzes the human and ﬁnancial impacts of more recent high proﬁle product liability
cases. Section 26.4 discusses U.S. product liability law, focusing on the types of claims
and defenses arising in product liability cases. Section 26.5 covers design practices and
procedures that manufacturers can use to reduce the risk of product liability. Section 26.6
examines insurance as a means of shifting and managing product liability risk. Finally,
Section 26.7 explains other risk management techniques.
26.2
Why Do Product Liability Suits Occur?
First and foremost, manufacturers face product liability suits, because their products are
involved in accidents. From the early days in the development of Anglo-American tort4
law, the road accident played a prominent role. A key British case in the development of
U.S. tort law, Winterbottom v. Wright,5 involved a mail coach driver who was thrown
from his horse-drawn mail carriage after it broke down, allegedly due to the defendant
contractor’s failure to maintain the carriage in a safe condition [32].6
Starting in the 20th century, the car accident caused signiﬁcant changes in U.S. product
liability law. “Products liability, like America, grew up with the automobile. Prior to the
entry of motorcars onto the nation’s highways, ‘there simply were not large numbers of
product-related lawsuits.’ Once America embraced the automobile, it inevitably embraced
4“Tort” means “wrong,” and “tort law” provides a mechanism for a plaintiff to seek redress in a civil
(i.e., non-criminal) case.
5It was common in the 19th century for American courts to cite contemporary British cases as
precedents.
6In Winterbottom, the court denied relief to the injured coachman because of a lack of direct
contractual relationship, called “privity,” between the plaintiff coachman and the defendant
contractor. The coachman was not a party the contract in which the defendant contractor promised to
maintain the coach in good working order [32].
554

automotive products suits as well” [13]. Two of the most signiﬁcant products liability
cases in American history arose from auto accidents. In MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.,
the famous American jurist Benjamin Cardozo writing for the New York Court of Appeals
upheld a verdict for a car owner ejected from his Buick car after a defective wooden wheel
on the car collapsed [22].7 In Henningsen v. Bloomﬁeld Motors, Inc. [17],8 the New Jersey
Supreme Court afﬁrmed a jury verdict against Chrysler and a dealer after the wife of the
purchaser had an accident. She testiﬁed that she felt something crack in the car, the
steering wheel spun sharply, the car veered off the road, and the car struck a highway sign
and brick wall.
The threadbare descriptions of the car accidents in these appellate courts’ decisions,
however, do not reﬂect the reality of the trial setting in which lawyers for the injured
plaintiffs will describe what might be a catastrophic car accident in unvarnished and
sometimes horriﬁc terms. Consider a description of the famous Ford Pinto accident
written in Mother Jones magazine. Although the description below comes from a writer,9
it is similar in tone and impact to what a plaintiff’s lawyer might say about his or her client
in an opening statement. Here is how the writer describes the accident:
[A] woman, whom for legal reasons we will call Sandra Gillespie, pulled onto a Minneapolis
highway in her new Ford Pinto. Riding with her was a young boy, whom we’ll call Robbie
Carlton. As she entered a merge lane, Sandra Gillespie’s car stalled. Another car rear-ended
hers at an impact speed of 28 miles per hour. The Pinto’s gas tank ruptured. Vapors from it
mixed quickly with the air in the passenger compartment. A spark ignited the mixture and the
car exploded in a ball of ﬁre. Sandra died in agony a few hours later in an emergency hospital.
Her passenger, 13-year-old Robbie Carlton, is still alive; he has just come home from another
futile operation aimed at grafting a new ear and nose from skin on the few unscarred portions
of his badly burned body. [11]
In the courtroom, the young boy, so badly disﬁgured by the accident, would likely be
sitting next to his attorney during the entire trial. The jury would be seated facing him, and
watching him. The unspoken testimony of his catastrophic injuries would likely have at
least an unconscious effect on the jurors watching him. Despite instructions from the judge
not to permit sympathy, bias, or prejudice to sway their verdict, a car manufacturer
defending this case would have an difﬁcult time at trial. In the Ford Pinto case, the
13-year-old boy, whose real name was Richard Grimshaw, received a jury award in the
amount of over $2.5 million in compensatory damages and an award of punitive damages
to punish and deter Ford in the amount of $125 million [15]. Part of the motivation for the
7The plaintiff had bought the car from a retailer, but could still sue the manufacturer despite the lack
of privity with the manufacturer [22]. The car was apparently going 8 miles per hour at the time of
the accident [13].
8The court rejected privity, a warranty disclaimer, and limits of liability as defenses to the warranty
claim of the wife driver of the car and her husband, the owner [17].

the victims became public.
26
Product Liability Issues in the U.S. …

large verdict was evidence during the trial of Ford’s apparently cold-hearted decision not
to use fairly inexpensive parts in its cars that would have prevented the accident. Although
the punitive damages award was later reduced in this case to $3.5 million [15], the Ford
Pinto case shows the kind of award that is possible in an automobile product liability case
following a catastrophic accident.
At some future time when an AV manufacturer faces a product liability trial, we can
expect to see accident victims seated in a courtroom with similar gruesome disﬁgurements
and stories of out-of-control cars and tragic, frightful accidents. The defendant manu-
facturer’s engineering and business practices will come under scrutiny. And a jury will
likely decide whether or not the manufacturer should be held responsible for the accidents.
During an AV’s design phase, its manufacturer’s design team will have an opportunity
to discuss and make engineering and business decisions about the design of its AVs. Team
members will talk about safety efforts the manufacturer is willing to undertake. In these
discussions, team members can think more clearly and assess risk more effectively by
imagining themselves in a courtroom setting, defending their practices in litigation arising
from a catastrophic accident.
Why are jurors willing to render these large verdicts against manufacturers? The short
answer is juror anger. “Angry jurors mean high damages” [24]. More speciﬁcally, juries
render large verdicts when they become angry at defendants’ conduct. When juries
become angry, the only way that they see they can redress the defendants’ wrongs is to
render very large verdicts against them in an effort to send a message that their conduct is
unacceptable.
In the Ford Pinto case, the jury heard evidence that Ford had known about the problems
with its fuel system. Ford had found the problem of rear-end crashes splitting open the
Pinto’s gas tank. In addition, Ford knew that a part costing $11 could have prevented the
accident. Nonetheless, Ford made a cost/beneﬁt analysis comparing the overall cost of
adding the safety part to the vehicle against the value of the lives lost from accidents
involving the vulnerability. Ford assigned a value to each human life likely lost. And Ford
decided that the overall cost of the part exceeded the overall value of the human lives that
would be saved and determined that it therefore should not add the part to the Pinto’s
design.
Ford’s cost/beneﬁt calculation seemed odious to the jury because it placed a dollar
value on human life. In addition, the jury knew that the extra part would only cost $11. By
not adding the part to the Pinto’s design, the jury evidently concluded that Ford placed its
proﬁts ahead of human life. Ford’s apparent callousness led to the jury anger [15].
In another famous product liability case, a Texas lawyer obtained a $253.5 million
verdict against pharmaceutical company Merck for Carol Ernst, the widow of Robert
Ernst. Mr. Ernst died after having taken Merck’s painkiller Vioxx for eight months [5].
The jury saw internal Merck documents showing that the company was aware of the heart
attack risk to users before it started marketing the drug. The documents gave the jury the
impression that the company cared more about proﬁts than public safety. As a result, the
556
S.S. Wu
jury tried, via the huge award, to send a message that it is wrong to hide information about
a drug’s danger [14]. Although an appellate court later overturned the jury’s verdict, again
the case underscores the risk of huge product liability verdicts [23].
26.3
More Recent High-Profile Product Liability Litigation
As noted in the previous section, appellate courts provided some relief to Ford and
overturned the verdict in the Vioxx case. Nonetheless, manufacturers should look to two
more recent sets of cases in order to analyze the potential human and ﬁnancial impact of
product liability issues. Section 26.3.1 covers the so-called “sudden acceleration” phe-
nomenon involving Toyota cars. Section 26.3.2 describes the fallout from the General
Motors ignition switch defects. These two cases show how manufacturers may need to
pay huge sums to resolve product liability legal proceedings, which are in addition to the
human toll of deaths and injuries.
26.3.1 “Sudden Acceleration” Litigation
Several years ago, news stories emerged concerning a phenomenon in which Toyota
drivers reported that their cars accelerated without warning and were difﬁcult to stop,
resulting in accidents. One typical news report stated, “Nancy Bernstein feels lucky to be
alive after her Toyota Prius kept accelerating, no matter how hard she hit the brakes. ‘The
car’s going about 70 miles an hour, and I’m beginning to get scared because it’s not
slowing down,’ Bernstein described” [26]. Lawsuits followed these accidents, and federal
cases were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California for
coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings [27].
Some reports contend that the 89 people may have died from accidents involving the
sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles [10]. Governmental investigations, however,
showed no evidence that design or implementation ﬂaws in Toyotas caused unintended
acceleration [25]. Accordingly, there was some controversy about whether Toyota or
drivers were at fault in these accidents.
Later in the litigation, however, a report by expert witness Michael Barr following
additional research opined that a software malfunction occurred in one of the cars and that
the malfunction resulted in unintended acceleration [4]. Barr identiﬁed numerous alleged
problems with the software, which according to Barr, Toyota’s own engineers had trouble
understanding and characterized as “spaghetti like” [4]. Barr testiﬁed about his ﬁndings in
an Oklahoma state court case and, apparently based in part on these ﬁndings, the jury in
the case awarded compensatory damages of $1.5 million to the driver and $1.5 million to
the family of a passenger who died in the crash [35]. The parties in the case, Bookout v.
Toyota Motor Corp. [7], settled the case right before a second phase of the trial to consider
punitive damages against Toyota [18].
26
Product Liability Issues in the U.S. …
557
Despite the uncertainty about what really caused these accidents, Toyota started to
settle the various legal actions against the company. The Oklahoma case may have been a
motivating factor [28].10 Toyota’s settlement payments so far include:
• $1.6 billion to settle ﬁnancial loss claims in the multidistrict litigation [28].
• $1.2 billion to settle potential criminal charges against Toyota [29].
• $25.5 million to settle shareholder claims arising the failure to report safety issues [29].
• $65 million in ﬁnes for violations of federal vehicle safety laws [29].
These settlement payouts are in addition to the numerous product liability lawsuits that
remain pending, the settlement of which presumably will cost a huge sum. If product
liability settlement amounts exceed $1 billion, then the total settlements may exceed
$4 billion. The cost of legal fees and other internal expenses related to investigation and
remedial measures will add even more to the ﬁnal cost for Toyota.
26.3.2 General Motors Ignition Switch Issues and Recall
Another high-proﬁle product liability issue arose from the recently uncovered problem
with ignition switches in certain General Motors cars. In the late 1990s, GM started using
new switches for small cars to make them work more smoothly. “But as it turns out, new
switches in models such as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion can unexpectedly slip
from ‘run’ to ‘accessory,’ causing engines to stall. That shuts off the power steering,
making cars harder to control, and disables air bags in crashes [20]. The problem sup-
posedly caused over 50 accidents. “GM says the problem has caused at least 13 deaths,
but some members of Congress put the death toll near 100” [20].
Apparently, GM engineers were aware of the problem before the accidents, but decided
not to replace the switches. An internal email uncovered in Congressional hearings dis-
cussed the fact that a more robust design would add 90 cents to the price of the switch, and
would only save 10–15 cents in reduced warranty claims [16]. “The part costs less than
$10 wholesale. The ﬁx takes less than an hour. A mechanic removes a few screws and
connectors, takes off a plastic shroud, pops in the new switch, and the customer is back on
the road” [12]. “[T]o many people familiar with the automaker,” the reason GM did not
recall the cars sooner “is a corporate culture reluctant to pass along bad news. When GM
was struggling to cut costs and buff its image, a recall of its popular small cars would have
been a terrible setback” [12]. “It’s pretty clear that somebody somewhere was being
penny-wise and pound-foolish,’ said Marina Whitman, a professor at the University of
Michigan and a former economist at GM” [12].
10“Legal analysts said that the verdict most likely spurred Toyota to pursue a broad settlement of its
remaining cases” [28].
558
S.S. Wu
GM’s decision not to recall the cars sooner is proving to be a costly one. Congress,
safety regulators, the U.S. attorney in New York City, the SEC, Transport Canada, and 45
state attorneys general are conducting probes of GM. GM is undertaking a costly recall of
the cars. Also, GM created a compensation fund for families of crash victims, which it
expects will cost the company $400–$600 million [19].
In addition to the compensation fund, GM said that it will spend $1.2 billion to repair the cars
and trucks recalled during the second quarter, on top of the $1.3 billion it identiﬁed for repair
costs in the ﬁrst three months of the year. In addition, the company set aside an additional
$874 million in the quarter for future recalls. [19]
The total expense for GM will be huge: “All told, GM’s recalls have cost the auto-
maker nearly $4 billion this year” [19]. Presumably, GM will continue to pay more in
future years as well. Moreover, GM will have to pay even more for legal fees and other
internal expenses related to investigation and remedial measures.
26.4
Claims and Defenses in Product Liability Cases
Having covered the phenomenon of product liability litigation, the human toll of acci-
dents, and the large ﬁnancial risks involved, this section covers what plaintiffs must prove
in order to prevail in a suit based on an allegedly defective product, as well as what
defendants must provide in order to assert certain defenses. Typical claims for plaintiffs
seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage from an accident are “strict product
liability,” “negligence,” and “breach of warranty.”11 Most of the law governing product
liability in the U.S. is state law, as opposed to federal law, and laws diverge from state to
state.
26.4.1 Strict Product Liability Claims
The easiest type of claim for a plaintiff to prove is a so-called “strict product liability”
claim. A plaintiff can include in the suit almost every business in the chain of distribution
from raw materials or component part manufacturers to manufacturers of the ﬁnished
product, distributors, and retailers [13]. Strict liability refers to liability for defective
products without fault on the part of the manufacturer and regardless of whether or not
there is a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and defendant. Laws vary sig-
niﬁcantly from state to state, and some states do not even recognize strict liability as a
viable claim. Nonetheless, most states’ statutory and common law strict liability laws are
11Another theory of recovery for plaintiffs is fraud, also known as “deceit” or “misrepresentation,”
and is based on false statements made by the seller about a product. Misrepresentations may be
intentional, negligent (careless), or innocent. This type of claim, however, is the least used theory of
recovery in the product liability context [13].
26
Product Liability Issues in the U.S. …
559
based on the formulation of strict liability under Section 402A of the Second Restatement
of Torts [2].12 As stated in the Restatement, in order to win a strict liability claim, the
plaintiff must prove at trial:
• The defendant sold the product in question,
• The defendant is in the business of selling this kind of product,
• The product was defective and unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the defen-
dant’s hands,
• The product is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial
change in the condition in which it is sold, and
• The defect was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries [2].
The key issue for AV strict liability design defect claims will be whether the vehicle
was “defective.” A plaintiff may assert that the product was defective in its design, the
product was defective in the way it was manufactured, and/or that the defendant failed to
provide adequate warnings or instructions to the users of the product. Of greatest concern
for AV litigation are design defect and failure to warn claims.
A plaintiff asserting a design defect would show the existence of a “defect” under the
applicable state law test. Courts in the U.S. apply one of the following tests:
• A test based on what an ordinary consumer would expect from a product, typically
used where the potential for injury is clear to consumers from the nature of the product.
• The risk-utility balancing test, where the plaintiff contends that the risks from a design
outweigh the beneﬁts to the consumer or public from a design.
• The product manufacturer test, which asks whether a reasonably prudent manufacturer
or seller, aware of the product’s dangerous condition, would not have put the product
on the market if it had been aware of the product’s condition.
• A combination test, which may shift the burden of proof to the manufacturer to show a
lack of defect in certain situations.
• The ultimate issue approach, in which the jury has the discretion to determine whether
a design is defective [31].
Frequently, a plaintiff asserting a design defect will use expert testimony to explain
why the defendant’s design is defective and will attempt to prove that an alternative
design could have prevented the accident.
In addition to relying on design defects, a plaintiff may also assert a strict liability claim
based on a “failure to warn” theory. Under this theory, the plaintiff could contend that an
AV was defective because the defendant failed to provide adequate warnings or instruc-
tions about the vehicle. The plaintiff would need to prove that the warnings did not
12“More than three quarters of American jurisdictions incorporate all or part of this section in their
own distinct brand of strict liability” [13]. Restatements of law summarize the law applicable ﬁeld of
law in the U.S., but do not themselves have the force of law.

adequately reduce risks associated with the product or that the instructions were inade-
quate to tell the user how to use the product.
26.4.2 Negligence Claims
As an alternative claim, product liability plaintiffs often include a negligence claim in their
complaints. The concept of “negligence” refers to careless conduct that falls below the
standard of conduct to which a hypothetical “reasonable man” would adhere. As with
strict liability, a plaintiff can assert a negligence claim based on the design of the product,
the way in which the product was manufactured, or the failure to give adequate warnings
or instructions. Negligence is a harder claim for a plaintiff than strict liability, because the
plaintiff must show some degree of fault on the part of the defendant.
In order to prevail in a negligence claim, the plaintiff must prove:
• The defendant owed a duty of care to provide a reasonably safe product in terms of
design or to warn of dangerous defects—meeting a standard of conduct to protect
others against unreasonable risk,
• The defendant breached its duty of care by failing to conform the standard of conduct
required, and
• The defendant’s conduct proximately caused the plaintiff’s injury [31].
26.4.3 Breach of Warranty Claims
In most states in the U.S., a plaintiff may also include a breach of warranty claim in a
product liability complaint. Warranties are afﬁrmations or promises concerning a product
or its performance, features, or characteristics, such as those concerning the safety of a
product. The basis of a breach of warranty claim is that the seller’s product does not
perform as promised, or does not have the features or characteristics promised. Design
defects, manufacturing defects, or failures to warn may all provide the basis for a warranty
claim. As with strict liability, the question is whether or not the product adheres to the
promises made, regardless of whether the seller is at fault for the failure to conform to the
promise. Nonetheless, warranty claims are subject to defenses with various degrees of
effectiveness, including the historical defense of “privity” (plaintiff’s lack of contractual
relationship with the defendant), the requirement that the plaintiff provide the seller notice
of the breach, and the ability for sellers to disclaim warranties [31]. In most U.S. juris-
dictions, purchasers of a product or their family members can sue companies in the chain
of distribution under a warranty theory despite the lack of privity [31].
In order to assert a breach of warranty claim, a plaintiff must typically prove:
• The defendant made a warranty,
• The product did not comply with the warranty at the time of the sale,
26
Product Liability Issues in the U.S. …
561
• The plaintiff’s injury was proximately caused by the defective nature of the product,
and
• As a result, the plaintiff suffered damage [31].
A warranty claim will typically allege one of three kinds of warranties. “Express
warranties” are those actually stated by the seller, such as in a sales contract, warranty
program documentation, advertisements, or sales collateral. They may be written or oral.
In addition to the express warranties, the law will sometimes recognize two kinds of
“implied warranties” regarding the sale of consumer products that arise by operation of
law, as opposed to anything the seller actually said.
One kind of implied warranty is the “implied warranty of merchantability.” This
implied warranty requires the seller to make sure the product is ﬁt for the ordinary
purposes of such product. For instance, a consumer would expect that the head of a
hammer would not ﬂy off the ﬁrst time it is used after purchase. This kind of implied
warranty is the one most likely to be asserted against a seller of an AV in future cases. The
second typical implied warranty is the “warranty of ﬁtness for a particular purpose.”
Where the seller knows the particular purpose for which the consumer will use the
product, and the buyer is relying on the skill and judgment of the seller to select and
furnish suitable products, the law will recognize an implied warranty that the product will
be ﬁt for that purpose. For instance, if a truck buyer tells a dealer’s sales representative
that the buyer seeks a pickup that will be able to tow a trailer through mountainous
off-road terrain, then the dealer is deemed to have warranted that the truck recommended
by the sales representative can, in fact, tow the trailer off-road in the mountains.
26.4.4 Claims Under Consumer Protection Laws
Plaintiffs sometimes assert product liability claims under various consumer protection
laws. State laws vary, and some states do not permit these laws to be used for personal
injuries [1]. They are commonly used when plaintiffs seek redress for alleged economic or
ﬁnancial losses, such as the diminution in the value of their products due to the alleged
defect. Examples include California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) [8], False Adver-
tising Law (FAL) [8], and Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) [9], as well as
equivalent laws in other states. Claims under these statutes typically require plaintiffs to
prove:
• A violation of the statute occurred.
• That causes.
• Injury to a consumer.
For instance, the UCL prohibits unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or prac-
tices. The FAL bars untrue or misleading advertising practices. The CLRA prohibits a list
of unfair business practices, such as misrepresenting the characteristics and qualities of a
product.

26.4.5 Types of Defects at Issue in Autonomous Vehicle Litigation
We do not yet have examples of cases ﬁled against AV manufacturers to say what kinds of
alleged defects will likely result in litigation. Nonetheless, the history of automotive
litigation, discussions with those in the industry, and judgments about what is likely to
come suggest that there will be many sources of potential defects that may give rise to
product liability litigation. AVs will share some of these sources of defects with con-
ventional vehicles, but some of them will be unique to AVs. The lists of potential defects
in this section are not meant to be exclusive, and there are many possible sources of
defects in conventional and autonomous vehicles.
Some possible design defects13 that AVs will have in common with conventional
vehicles include:
• Mechanical or physical defects in various systems of the vehicles or their safety
equipment, such as the use of materials that are not strong or thick enough,14 or an
excessively high center of gravity subjecting the vehicle to rollovers.
• Defects in electrical components or systems other than sensors or control systems for
autonomous driving, such as the use of wrong kind of components, problems in the
performance of the components, or the lack of durability of the components.
• Software15 defects relating to systems other than sensors or control systems for
autonomous driving, including information security vulnerabilities.
These defects will occur in both conventional and autonomous vehicles and thus
existing law and litigation methods would apply to determine a manufacturer’s liability.
Nonetheless, AVs may experience defects that conventional vehicles do not. Again,
they may be mechanical, electronic, or software.
• Mechanical or physical defects in the control systems for autonomous mode or the
sensors used by the autonomous systems. A simple example would be weak mountings
for LIDAR sensors which, if they failed, might cause the AV to lose its sensor data
suddenly and crash.
• Defects in electrical components for sensors or control systems for autonomous
driving.
• Software defects in the sensors or control systems used for autonomous mode.
The most interesting and perhaps most concerning potential defects are those in the
software used for autonomous driving. Some examples include:
13Another issue for manufacturers of ﬁnished products concerns their supply chains. Counterfeit or
defective components may introduce manufacturing defects into AVs.
14For example, the author was involved in one case in which the plaintiff alleged that the metal in a
car’s tie rod was not strong enough, the metal fatigue experienced by ordinary wear of the car
weakened the tie rod, and an accident occurred because metal fatigue caused the tie rod to break.
15The “software” involved may be in the form of code built into hardware or ﬁrmware.
26
Product Liability Issues in the U.S. …
563
• Designs that depend on inadequate data from sensors, including insufﬁcient amount,
inaccuracy, deﬁcient precision, or inadequate speed of data input.
• Inaccurate pattern recognition, such as the AV failing to be able to recognize a
pedestrian in the road or other upcoming obstacles or hazards.
• Designs that fail to perform safe ordinary maneuvers such as turns, lane-keeping,
distance-keeping, and merging.
• Other problems with autonomous behavior, such as unpredictable changes in speed or
direction.
• Deﬁcient collision avoidance algorithms.
• Information security vulnerabilities.
• Defects arising from inadequate human-computer coordination. For instance, if an AV
switches between autonomous and manual mode, the AV must alert the driver before
switching to manual mode and transition to human control safely.
Moreover, Chap. 4 discusses design decisions programmers must make when creating
the logic for an AV to handle the situation of when a collision is imminent and
unavoidable and there is a choice between striking and harming different persons. For
instance, an AV may face the dilemma of striking a motorcycle rider wearing a helmet or
one without a helmet, and a programmer might decide that it is better, if a collision is
unavoidable, to strike one or the other. If the programmer makes such a decision and
designs the software to implement that decision, this kind of design decision could be the
subject of a product liability suit from the person struck by operation of the software.
26.4.6 Defenses in Product Liability Cases
Defendants may assert a number of defenses against a product liability case. The most
common types of defenses relate to the conduct of the plaintiff. In some cases, the
defendant contends that the plaintiff’s negligent conduct caused or contributed to an
accident. The viability of a defense based on a plaintiff’s own negligence depends on state
law and the type of claim, but a defendant may also use it as evidence of a superseding
cause of an accident. In addition, some accidents occur because a plaintiff misused or
modiﬁed a product. In some cases, a plaintiff is said to have “assumed the risk” of an
open, obvious hazard, such as the possibility of being struck by a golf ball on the links.
Finally, a plaintiff may not be able to recover all damages if he or she failed in some way
to mitigate the damages.
Many of these defenses may have limited application to persons driving AVs in
autonomous mode. If the plaintiff was not in control of the vehicle at the time of the
accident, the plaintiff could not have driven carelessly. Once AVs enter the mass market, a
seller cannot realistically contend that the plaintiff assumed the risk of driving a vehicle
using new and untested technology. Nonetheless, it is likely over time that some people
will modify their AVs or try to abuse the sensors or control systems for fun. In these cases,
564
S.S. Wu
if an accident occurs, the defendant may point to this conduct as a defense. Moreover,
defenses based on a plaintiff’s conduct could reduce or bar a plaintiff’s recovery when the
plaintiff was not a driver of the AV, such as a pedestrian carelessly (or intentionally)
darting out in front of an AV faster than any human or machine could react.
The other key defense in AV litigation will likely be a “state of the art” defense to a
design defect claim. The basis of this defense is that the manufacturer could not have
produced a safer design at the time of sale because safer designs were not technologically
feasible then. Such a defense is valid in some states while not in others [13].16
26.5
Managing the Risk of Autonomous Vehicle Product
Liability
Having covered the nature of product liability, the potentially huge exposure for losses,
juror anger that leads to huge jury verdicts, and the nature of product liability, I now turn
to the issue of how manufacturers can manage the risk of product liability litigation.17
First and foremost, managing these risks requires a proactive approach. By planning
today, manufacturers can be prepared for the inevitable suits later. First, planning can
enable them to make safer products that are less likely to cause litigation-triggering
accidents in the ﬁrst place. Second, by planning ahead, manufacturers can increase their
chances of winning the cases that accidents do trigger. A proactive approach to design
safety with a comprehensive risk management program establishes upfront a manufac-
turer’s commitment to safety. When the inevitable suit happens later, the manufacturer’s
counsel has a story to tell the jury as to why its products were safe and how the manu-
facturer cared about safety.
Second, manufacturers should consider the commitment they make to product safety
using such a proactive approach. One commentator stated, “The most effective way for
[counsel for] a corporate defendant to reduce anger toward his or her client is to show all
the ways that the client went beyond what was required by the law or industry practice”
[24]. Meeting minimum standards is insufﬁcient because of juror skepticism about the
rigor of standards set or inﬂuenced by industry and because jurors expect corporate clients
to know more about product safety than a “reasonable person”—the standard for judging
16Another typical product liability-speciﬁc defense is the economic loss doctrine, which bars product
liability tort claims where the claimed damages are ﬁnancial and not for bodily injury or damage to
property other than the product itself. Moreover, federal law may preempt some state law claims,
because U.S. federal law trumps state laws inconsistent with it. Also, if a product is meant to be used
by a “sophisticated user” or provided by a “sophisticated intermediary,” the seller may have a
defense under certain circumstances, although this defense is unlikely to apply to AVs. Finally, if a
manufacturer creates a product pursuant to government speciﬁcation, it may have a “government
contractor defense.”
17I speak here of product liability litigation, although the risk management techniques here also
apply to preventing the need for costly product recalls.
26
Product Liability Issues in the U.S. …
565
the conduct of defendants under the law [24]. “A successful defense can also be supported
by walking jurors through the relevant manufacturing or decision-making process,
showing all of the testing, checking, and follow-up actions that were included. Jurors who
have no familiarity with complex business processes are often impressed with all of the
thought that went into the process and all of the precautions that were taken” [24]. Even
though accidents do occur, and in any trial setting an accident or problem did occur, a
defendant’s proactive approach would show the jury that the manufacturer tried hard to do
the right thing [24]. Consequently, efforts to go above and beyond the minimum standards
would diffuse juror anger and mitigate the manufacturer’s risk.
Third, manufacturers should recognize that risk management is a process that begins
with a careful risk analysis looking at the types, likelihood, and impact of issues in the
design of AVs. Once a risk assessment is complete, they can review the results and
analyze changes in design and engineering practices to address these issues, prioritize
risks and risk mitigation measures, and implement the prioritized risk mitigation measures
[34]. In connection with the risk management process, manufacturers can obtain guidance
from a number of standards bearing on risk management and safety:
• ISO 31000 “Risk management—Principles and guidelines” (regarding the risk man-
agement process).
• Software development guidelines from the Motor Industry Software Reliability
Association.
• IEC
61508
Functional
safety
of
electrical/electronic/programmable
electronic
safety-related systems (safety standard for electronic systems and software).
• ISO 26262 family of “Functional Safety” standards implementing IEC 61508 for the
functional safety of electronic systems and software for autos.
While adherence to the principles of international standards does not guarantee that an
AV manufacturer will avoid liability, adherence to standards bolsters the credibility of a
manufacturer’s risk management program. Moreover, the standards provide a framework
by which manufacturers can build a set of controls for their risk management process.
Consequently, an AV safety program built on international standards lays the foundation
for a later defense of a manufacturer accused of building an unsafe AV.
Fourth, AV manufacturers should obtain insurance coverage to manage product lia-
bility risk. A robust insurance program will permit manufacturers to shift the risk of
product liability to insurance carriers who will, under issued policies, defend and
indemnify manufacturers for settlements and judgments paid to resolve third party claims.
Currently, the insurance industry is just beginning to come to grips with the insurance
implications of AVs [21]. We can expect to see the insurance industry provide third party
coverage to manufacturers for accidents, and probably privacy and information security
risks as well. While the industry has no historical data for an actuarial approach to
underwriting AV risks, the industry will probably look by analogy to conventional
vehicles and mobile devices for loss experiences [6]. AV manufacturers can ﬁnd carriers
willing to write bespoke policies tailor-made to their needs. Eventually other carriers will
566
S.S. Wu
enter the market and offer more standardized polices, thereby reducing premium costs to
manufacturers over the long run.
Fifth, manufacturers can work together on industry risk management initiatives, such as:
• Participation in standards efforts to promote safety and security within the industry and
among component manufacturers;
• Collaborating with other manufacturers in trade groups and (subject to antitrust con-
cerns) purchasing consortia; with the purchasing power of larger numbers of manu-
facturers, the industry may have greater leverage with component manufacturers to
promote safe design and manufacturing processes; and
• Participation in information sharing groups that can collaborate to develop best
practices to improve product safety.
Sixth, manufacturers can manage the risk of huge jury awards by certain pre-litigation
strategies. For instance, they may want to engage jury consultants that assist the defense of
product liability cases to identify risk factors for the manufacturer and the types of conduct
that trigger juror anger. In addition, manufacturers may want to identify and cultivate a
group of defense experts they can use to educate jurors about various engineering,
information technology, and safety considerations. Moreover, counsel for manufacturers
may want to join specialty bars for defense counsel for purposes of sharing information,
briefs, and other work product.
Finally, manufacturers can maximize their success in future product liability trials by
focusing on effective records and information management (RIM). Effective RIM may
win cases, while poor RIM may lose cases. Documents and records produced contem-
poraneously with the management of a safety program can corroborate the testimony of
witnesses, provide a historical record documenting a manufacturer’s safety efforts, and
send the message that the manufacturer cares about safety.
26.6
Conclusions
One of the top, if not the top, challenge autonomous vehicle manufacturers face is the risk
of product liability suits and recalls in the wake of accidents resulting in deaths and
catastrophic injuries. Lawsuits in which manufacturers appear callous, placing proﬁts over
safety, face the risk of huge liabilities. Recent reports about “sudden acceleration” in
Toyota cars and problems with General Motors’ ignition switches show that these com-
panies are paying multiple billions of dollars to resolve legal claims. Plaintiffs have a
number of claims they can assert against AV manufacturers, although manufacturers may
have defenses as well. Various kinds of defects may crop up with AVs, although problems
with software, logic, autonomous behavior, and programmer decisions on AV behavior in
crashes are top concerns. Nonetheless, manufacturers can manage product liability risk
through careful planning, a strong commitment to safety, an effective risk management
process beginning with a thorough risk analysis, adherence to international standards,
26

567
obtaining robust insurance coverage, collaboration with other manufacturers, pre-litigation
legal strategies, and effective records and information management practices. In sum, the
threat of crippling product liability litigation in the United States poses a profound concern
for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles, but starting proactive engineering design
strategies for safety risk management and legal strategies to anticipate future litigation
now can place manufacturers in the best position to maximize product safety and mini-
mize product liability in upcoming decades.

Regulation and the Risk of Inaction
Bryant Walker Smith
Abstract
This chapter begins with two fundamental questions: How should risk be allocated in
the face of signiﬁcant uncertainty—and who should decide? Its focus on public actors
reﬂects the signiﬁcant role that legislatures, administrative agencies, and courts will
play in answering these questions, whether through rules, investigations, verdicts, or
other forms of public regulation. The eight strategies discussed in this chapter would in
effect regulate that regulation. They seek to ensure that those who are injured can be
compensated (by expanding public insurance and facilitating private insurance), that
any prospective rules develop in tandem with the technologies to which they would
apply (by privileging the concrete and delegating the safety case), that reasonable
design choices receive sufﬁcient legal support (by limiting the duration of risk and
excluding the extreme), and that conventional driving is subject to as much scrutiny as
automated driving (by rejecting the status quo and embracing enterprise liability).

Introduction
27.1.1 In Context
Two complex and conﬂicting objectives shape altruistic regulation of human activity:
maximizing net social good and mitigating incidental individual loss. Eminent domain
provides a superﬁcially simple example: To build a road that beneﬁts ten thousand people,
a government evicts—and compensates—the ten people whose homes are in the way. But

in many cases, individual loss is not fully compensable, most strikingly when that loss
involves death: Whatever her actual detriment, a person who dies cannot be “made
whole.” And indeed, more than 30,000 people lose their lives on US roadways every year
while more than 300 million obtain some direct or indirect beneﬁt from motorized
transport.
The promise that vehicle automation holds for highway safety raises difﬁcult questions
about regulation’s social and individual objectives. Analyzing either objective requires
topical and temporal deﬁnition of a manageable system in which costs and beneﬁts can be
identiﬁed, valued, and compared. With respect to net social good, what is the statistical
value of a human life? Is a reduction in organ donations a “cost” of safer highways? Could
aggressive deployment of particular technologies cause a backlash that ultimately
undermines safety? Similarly, with respect to individual loss, how should injury or death
be valued? Should culpability affect compensation? Who is entitled to it? The particular
answers to these questions may depend on the domain—law, economics, ethics, the social
sciences—from which they are drawn.
Vehicle automation exposes tension between the social and individual objectives.
Externalities frequently accompany innovation: Inventors impose costs that they need not
or cannot bear and create beneﬁts that they cannot capture. Compensation of incidental
injury may be one such cost, and socially desirable innovations like automation might be
subsidized by shielding them from it. Calibrating net social good and individual loss can
also create moral hazard: Safety might be discounted by innovators who are legally or
effectively exempt from rules and immunized from lawsuits or by consumers who are
assured of compensation for injury.
This tension exists against two related background conditions. The ﬁrst is a preference
for the status quo—a tendency that is reﬂected in administrative law, in tort law, and
internationally in the precautionary principle. Many vehicle fatalities appear only in local
obituaries, but a single automated vehicle fatality would end up on national front pages.
The second is a failure by imperfectly probabilistic humans to accurately perceive risk.
Drivers who speed around blind corners but fear traveling over bridges demonstrate this
tendency to underestimate some risks and overestimate others.
This complex regulatory context leads to two fundamental questions: How should risk
be allocated in the face of signiﬁcant uncertainty—and who should decide? The range of
actors includes the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of national and subnational
governments, companies, standards organizations, consumers, and the public at large.
Regulation can be prospective or retrospective, but it cannot be nonexistent: Adminis-
trative agencies that decline to establish safety requirements for automated vehicles
merely leave this task to judges and juries after incidents have occurred.
The consequences of action or inaction are as stark as they are uncertain. Regulatory
acts or omissions could cost lives in the near term by delaying or raising the price of
automation technologies [1]. But they could also save lives in the longer term by pro-
tecting broad classes of innovation from the potential reputational damage that early
tragedies or controversies could inﬂict. Charting the currents of abstract social gain and

concrete human loss from vehicle automation requires appreciating the risks that regu-
lation presents as well as those that it addresses.
This chapter ﬁrst considers the nature of risk, the nature of regulation, and the chal-
lenge of regulating—in a broad sense—the increasing automation of motor vehicles. It
then introduces four pairs of potential strategies to respond to this challenge, as sum-
marized in Table 27.1.
These strategies are not exhaustive. They may be unnecessary. And they may be
insufﬁcient. Some are obvious, some are unconventional, and some may well be both.
Their purpose is to advance discussion of the proper role of the public sector—legisla-
tures, administrative agencies, and courts—in addressing automation’s challenges and
opportunities.
27.1.2 What Is Risk?
Risk can mean so many things that, without context, it means not much at all. Broadly,
“[t]he risk of a particular harm is the product of the probability of that harm and the
severity of that harm; the risk of an act or omission is the sum of the risks of the particular
associated harms” [2]. This actual risk, however, is merely theoretical: No actor can
comprehensively inventory all associated harms or accurately determine their probabilities
and magnitudes.
In practice, actual risk is therefore simpliﬁed into assessed and perceived risk. Assessed
risk reﬂects a methodical attempt to objectively describe all signiﬁcant harms within a
deﬁned system; this system might contemplate a broad range of harms, as in the case of an
environmental impact statement, or a more narrow range, as in the case of a functional
safety standard focused on physical injury to humans [2]. In contrast, perceived risk
reﬂects an individual’s subjective judgment about particular dangers; it may differ con-
siderably from the assessed risk.
An internalized risk is one that is borne by the actor who creates it, regardless of
whether that actor has correctly assessed or perceived that risk. Internalization is central to

Regulation and the Risk of Inaction

tort law’s regulatory role: By forcing actors to bear more of the costs of their unreasonably
dangerous behavior, tort law seeks to deter that behavior.
The ﬁnancial risks imposed on these actors, however, are categorically different from
the physical risks that these actors impose on others. In obligating these actors to pay
damages to those they have injured, tort law also plays a compensatory role. Nonetheless,
even if those who are injured succeed in recovering damages, they will still have been
injured [2].
Accordingly, it is important to distinguish between reducing physical risk (a regulatory
function) and shifting ﬁnancial risk (a compensatory function). Some of the regulatory
strategies introduced below may achieve one of these two objectives at the expense of the
other.
27.1.3 What Is Regulation?
Regulation checks and changes behavior. In its narrowest sense, the term refers only to
rules enacted by an administrative agency. A more useful conception, however, encom-
passes a broad range of actions, including those illustrated in Fig. 27.1 [3].
Regulation can be prospective (forward-looking) or retrospective (backward-looking).
Prospective actions, shown on the left side, contemplate a generalized risk that has not
manifested, as in the case of the federal performance requirements governing vehicle
design. In contrast, retrospective actions, shown on the right side, respond to the real-
ization of a risk, as in the case of a tort claim by a person injured in a crash. The possibility
of retrospective regulation, particularly if it is foreseeable, can affect behavior even if the
risk is never realized.
Regulation can also be pursued by a public actor or by a private actor. Public actions,
shown on the top, include typical functions of the state: setting requirements and con-
ducting investigations. In contrast, private actions, shown on the bottom, generally
Fig. 27.1 Quadrants of regulation
574
B.W. Smith
involve relationships among private parties: a consensus among market participants, a
contract between an insurer and its insured, or the tort duties of a manufacturer to those
who are injured by its products.
Although this chapter focuses on public actors, these private relationships remain an
important tool of public policy. A statutory requirement that drivers obtain sufﬁcient
insurance, for example, delegates some regulatory power to the private-sector insurance
companies that then decide, subject to additional public regulation, how much any par-
ticular driver should be charged.
27.1.4 The Regulatory Challenge
For public regulators, the utilitarian challenge is to indirectly maximize net social good
while indirectly mitigating incidental individual loss. With respect to vehicle automation,
this means deﬁning an appropriate system in which societal costs and beneﬁts can be
analyzed [2], checking that the incentives and disincentives for developers of automated
systems are consistent with that system, reconciling these with the incentives and disin-
centives for other actors, and ensuring that those who are harmed have appropriate access
to some means of compensation.
This chapter outlines four pairs of potential regulatory strategies that could advance
these goals. Its focus on risk management by public actors complements earlier risk
management proposals for private actors [4]. These strategies involve ensuring compen-
sation by expanding public insurance and facilitating private insurance, forcing
information-sharing by privileging the concrete and delegating the safety case, simplifying
the problem by limiting the duration of risk and excluding the extreme, and raising the
playing ﬁeld by rejecting the status quo and embracing enterprise liability.
27.2
Ensure Compensation
27.2.1 Expand Public Insurance
Insurance can help reduce the ﬁnancial burden placed on injured individuals and,
potentially, the compensatory pressure placed on tort law. Ensuring that those who are
physically injured by automated vehicles are able to recover for their injuries makes the
occurrence of those injuries, at least from a public policy perspective, more justiﬁable. If
the only avenue for that recovery, however, is litigation, product liability law may be
forced to bend in ways that distort its regulatory function.
While an expansion of insurance has merit as a standalone initiative, it must be a
condition of any reasonable proposal to subsidize vehicle automation by limiting tort
remedies. Reducing a defendant’s liability means reducing an injured individual’s access
to compensation. It also means depriving that individual of a sanctioned means of
27
Regulation and the Risk of Inaction
575
recourse: Suing a manufacturer, whatever its inefﬁciencies, is still preferable to sabotaging
that company’s products or undertaking other means of private retribution.
27.2.2 Facilitate Private Insurance
While private insurers can also provide compensation, their potential role as regulators is
particularly promising. A well-functioning insurance market can generate useful data and
desirable incentives. It can reduce uncertainty for those who might be plaintiffs as well as
for those who are regularly defendants. Take two distinct examples: vehicle insurance and
product liability insurance.
In the United States, most drivers and vehicle owners are required to carry insurance for
harms inﬂicted with their vehicles. The required coverage varies by state and is generally
far less than would be necessary to compensate for a serious injury or death; California, for
example, requires only $15,000 in coverage for injury or death to one person and $30,000
in coverage for injury or death to more than one person [5]. The companies that offer this
insurance tend to be subject to complex regulatory regimes that also vary by state; Cali-
fornia even prescribes the primary factors to be used in pricing such insurance [6].
An alternative regime could respond much more ﬂexibly to vehicle automation.
Increasing and then enforcing insurance requirements could help internalize more crash
costs, compensate injury more fully, shift some recovery from manufacturers toward
negligent drivers, and enable consolidation of some product liability claims through
subrogation. Reducing consumer-facing restrictions on insurers could free these compa-
nies to better tailor their products to reﬂect the actual risk posed by particular drivers in
particular vehicles in particular conditions. This could in turn advantage those automated
vehicles that actually represent a safety improvement.
In contrast to drivers, companies are generally not required by law to maintain product
liability insurance. Indeed, one of the purposes of the corporate form is to protect
shareholders from liability. Requiring such coverage, however, could provide a check on
safety by engaging a third-party insurer in a regulatory role: In order to obtain affordable
coverage—or coverage at all—a manufacturer would need to persuade the insurer that its
products do not pose unreasonable risk. This would be another way to “delegate the safety
case,” to quote the section of the same name below.
The regimes created by Nevada and California to regulate automated vehicles already
require companies seeking to test their systems on public roads to demonstrate ﬁnancial
capacity beyond typical state insurance requirements. California, for example, requires
$5,000,000 in the form of a certiﬁcate of insurance, a certiﬁcate of self-insurance, or a
surety bond [7]. While this approach is promising, these heightened insurance require-
ments should apply to all vehicles rather than merely to automated vehicles undergoing
testing. As the section of the same name argues below, such regulation should “raise the
playing ﬁeld” for conventional as well as automated vehicles.
576
B.W. Smith
27.3
Force Information-Sharing
27.3.1 Privilege the Concrete
Product development requires understanding, and as necessary shaping, external forces
like law. If speciﬁc legal obligations, restrictions, or liabilities are impeding automated
vehicle technologies, then would-be developers of those technologies should challenge
those constraints. In short, they should identify the speciﬁc legal changes that they or their
products require—and support these arguments with concrete data and careful analysis. If
they do not, policymakers should ask why.
Although concerns have been raised for decades about the product liability implications
of increasing vehicle automation [8], automakers tend to refer only broadly, if at all, to this
potential challenge even as they announce plans to deploy increasingly advanced
automation features. This apparent disconnect suggests either that the technologies them-
selves are not as imminent as popularly believed [9] or that the companies pursuing those
technologies are not as concerned about general product liability as is commonly suggested.
In contrast, automakers have acted to address a more narrow liability question related
to the installation or modiﬁcation of automation systems. Several state legislatures have
now clariﬁed that, to quote Michigan law [10], manufacturers and subcomponent pro-
ducers are “not liable and shall be dismissed from any action for alleged damages resulting
from” such third-party installations or conversions “unless the defect from which the
damages resulted was present” at the time of manufacture. This provision is largely a
restatement of common law [9] and, like common law, does not unambiguously con-
template every potential modiﬁcation claim.1
Notwithstanding this uncertainty, this experience demonstrates that established
automakers can recognize potential legal issues, propose speciﬁc legislative remedies, and
—with the exception of California [11]—obtain their enactment. To the extent that
automated vehicles depend on changes to vehicle codes [12], insurance requirements, or
rules of liability, regulators should expect well-reasoned and well-supported arguments
from their high-proﬁle developers.
Relying exclusively on companies to advance speciﬁc legal changes, however, can
tend to preserve the status quo. Unlike conventional cars, low-speed shuttles and delivery
robots generally have neither existing markets nor established companies to advocate for
them. As a result, these applications of automation have been largely ignored in recent
legislative and regulatory initiatives [9]. Accordingly, governments should also consider
whether a dearth of speciﬁc proposals or concrete data can be explained by an inability
rather than a disinclination to participate in the regulatory process.
1Consider two examples. In the ﬁrst, the manufacturer fails to warn against a foreseeable
modiﬁcation of its vehicle; might that failure to warn constitute a “defect from which the damages
resulted”? In the second, the subcomponent producer designs a sensor that is highly vulnerable to
hacking; might that security vulnerability constitute a “defect from which the damages resulted”?
27
Regulation and the Risk of Inaction
577
In a sense, governments should approach policymaking with the same philosophy
underlying public support of physical infrastructure and scientiﬁc research: Initiate what
the private sector cannot or will not do. Broad mandates or basic conditions may be useful
in driving or policing innovation, but attempts to closely tailor rules to products that do
not yet exist could produce law that is premature and prejudicial.
27.3.2 Delegate the Safety Case
Vehicle automation is putting state regulators in a difﬁcult position. Prominent examples
come from Nevada and California, the two states whose departments of motor vehicles
were directed to quickly enact regulations governing automated vehicles and automated
driving.2 These regulations seek both to provide greater legal certainty to the developers
of automated systems [13–15] and to restrict unreasonably dangerous products and
practices [16].
Many states, however, already empower regulators to restrict the registration, modi-
ﬁcation, or operation of road vehicles on the basis of safety [12]. A New York statute, for
example, permits the motor vehicle commissioner to “refuse to register any vehicle or
class of vehicles for use on the public highways where he determines that the charac-
teristics of such vehicle or class of vehicles make such vehicle or vehicles unsafe for
highway operation” [17].
Alternative approaches to deploying automation systems, including pilot projects and
aftermarket modiﬁcations, may implicate this authority more quickly than would tradi-
tional rollouts [9]. Long before the National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration
(NHTSA) promulgates rules for automated vehicles3 or even conducts investigations into
incidents involving them, state regulators may be facing—or at least actively ignoring—
the question of whether to revoke the registration of a vehicle retroﬁtted with a novel
automation system.
Answering such a question will inevitably frustrate these regulators [15]. There is no
consensus about how to deﬁne, or then how to demonstrate, the appropriate level of safety
for an automated vehicle or for the human-machine system to which it may belong [18].
Moreover, the kind of regulation that is appropriate for an established automaker may
differ considerably from the kind that is appropriate for a small startup or an individual
tinkerer [9].
Although state vehicle agencies generally lack NHTSA’s technical resources, they may
have more regulatory ﬂexibility. Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) are
2Other states have enacted automated driving statutes without expressly requiring this rulemaking.
3NHTSA has historically promulgated performance standards only for safety technologies that have
already been widely deployed, although the eventual regulation of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
communications systems is likely to be an exception.
578
B.W. Smith
restricted to objective measures and to tests “capable of producing identical results when
test conditions are exactly duplicated” [19], quoted in [20].
In contrast, state agencies may be bound by less demanding requirements of admin-
istrative process, which may afford them the discretion needed to gradually develop
consistent practice. Such ﬂexibility could enable regulators to address speciﬁc technolo-
gies without entrenching rules that are likely to become anachronistic and irreconcilable
with others.
To this end, “delegating the safety case” would mean requiring the developer of a
vehicle automation system to publicly make and defend arguments about how well its
system should perform and how well its system actually performs. In short:
1. A manufacturer documents its actual and planned product design, testing, and
monitoring.
2. The manufacturer publicly presents this documentation in the form of a safety case.
3. The regulatory agency and interested parties comment on this safety case.
4. The manufacturer publicly addresses these comments.
5. The agency determines that the manufacturer has presented a reasonable safety case.
6. The manufacturer certiﬁes that its product adheres to its safety case.
7. The manufacturer sells that product.
This process draws on several existing models, including the type approval (or
homologation) typical in the European Union and the self-certiﬁcation prescribed by US
law. It could accommodate the kind of process standards used in ISO 26262, the kind of
alternatives discussion characteristic of environmental impact statements, and the kind of
public dialogue foundational to notice-and-comment rulemaking.
By encouraging companies to disclose information necessary to their safety case, such
an approach could help educate regulators and the broader public about the capabilities
and limitations of these emerging technologies. Although disclosure could justiﬁably
concern some developers, this process would not require the disclosure of all information,
only that which is necessary to demonstrate a reasonable safety case. What is reasonable
will likely evolve, and this approach could afford companies greater ﬂexibility to make
nontraditional arguments for the safety of their systems and regulators greater ﬂexibility to
adapt to changing capabilities.
Because ﬂexibility can also mean uncertainty, early collaboration between regulators and
developers may be necessary to avoid all-or-nothing approval decisions at the end of
product development. Regardless, uncertainty is not a new concern: Whatever clarity that
the current federal regime offers through self-certiﬁcation to speciﬁc standards is diminished
by the recalls and lawsuits that can arise years or even decades after a vehicle has been sold.
Indeed, unlike current federal motor vehicle safety standards, a safety case could
contemplate the entire product lifecycle. A developer might describe not only the steps it
had taken to ensure reasonable safety at the time of sale but also the steps it would
continue to take as it learned more about performance in the ﬁeld.
27
Regulation and the Risk of Inaction
579
27.4
Simplify the Problem
27.4.1 Limit the Duration of Risk
The potential longevity of any motor vehicle—the “average” age of cars in the United
States is more than eleven years [21]—can create uncertainty for its manufacturers [4] and
safety concerns for the public [14]. In 2013, Chrysler reluctantly recalled some Jeeps that
were twenty years old [22, 23]. More generally, newer vehicles tend to be safer than older
vehicles; “improvements made after the model year 2000 ﬂeet prevented the crashes of
700,000 vehicles; prevented or mitigated the injuries of 1 million occupants; and saved
2000 lives in the 2008 calendar year alone” [24].
This uncertainty may be particularly great in the case of automated vehicles [4]. Even
extensive testing may not capture the full range of scenarios that these vehicles could face.
Manufacturers may have difﬁculty predicting “the eventual response of judges, juries,
regulators, consumers, and the public at large to incidents that will inevitably occur” [1].
Regulators may be “concerned that, ﬁrst, isolated incidents involving these products will
create feelings of helplessness and panic that unjustiﬁably stymie their wider adoption and
that, second, these early products will still be around years later when they are much less
safe than whatever has become state of the art” [14].
A promising response to these challenges is a lifecycle approach to vehicle design that
seeks to limit the duration of risk. For the private sector, this could entail over-the-air
updates, end-user license agreements, leasing arrangements, and a variety of other tech-
nical and legal tools to enable manufacturers to update or even forcibly retire systems in
which they no longer have conﬁdence [4]. For the public sector, this could mean requiring
companies to document a strategy and a capacity for monitoring the long-term safety of
their systems. Such documentation could be a key part of the safety case introduced
above.
27.4.2 Exclude the Extreme
The aphorism that “the perfect is the enemy of the good” [25] is instructive for vehicle
automation. Demanding perfection may impede the development or deployment of sys-
tems that, while not perfect, nonetheless represent a signiﬁcant improvement over con-
ventional vehicles. Excessive design demands, for example, might preclude an automated
vehicle that could avoid many of the common errors of human drivers but that could not
avoid catastrophic multicar freeway pileups to the extent physically possible. In other
words, it may be prudent to accept some failures in order to expedite larger successes.
Moreover, attempting to design an automated vehicle to handle every conceivable
driving scenario may introduce complexity that is poorly understood, unmanageable, and
ultimately detrimental to safety. Again, for example, designing an automated vehicle to
rapidly accelerate through a pileup-in-progress might lead to programming oversights that
580
B.W. Smith
could cause that same vehicle to errantly speed up after entering a closed construction
zone. Here it may be prudent to accept some failures in order to prevent even more
catastrophic failures.
For both of these reasons, early generations of automated vehicles may necessarily
limit the technical challenges that they attempt to solve. These vehicles might be deployed
into simpliﬁed environments at lower speeds [9]. Or they might continue to rely in part on
human drivers [26], particularly if those humans are professionals who can be carefully
trained, closely monitored, and sufﬁciently incentivized.
Sound engineering may demand additional limitations. For example, it may be prudent
to program an automated vehicle to never speed, to always slow to a stop in the event of a
detected failure, or to always permit human override within a set number of seconds.
These stylized examples might mean that, in occasional cases, an automated vehicle will
crash because it has failed to accelerate or because it has stopped or because its human
driver has made poor decisions while panicking.
Although these should be primarily technical determinations, law may be able to play a
supporting role. In some jurisdictions, for example, the plaintiff in a product liability case
must demonstrate that an alternative product design was available and superior to the one
alleged to have contributed to her injury. In such a case, it may be appropriate to give
more weight to counterarguments about the complexity, uncertainty, and delay inherent in
such designs.
There are, however, two important cautions. First, for those injuries that do occur, this
strategy merely shifts more of the risk to those people who have been injured. This
consequence highlights the need for a sufﬁcient social safety net, whether provided
through public insurance, private insurance, or another means. Second, codifying a ceiling
on the performance required could mean calcifying the level of reasonable design for
technologies that may quickly be capable of much more.
27.5
Raise the Playing Field
27.5.1 Reject the Status Quo
The reality that human drivers often violate rules of the road prompts speculation that
programming automated vehicles to comply with these rules would reduce their appeal.
Suggestions for addressing this perceived disadvantage have included expressly permit-
ting automated vehicles to travel at or above the prevailing trafﬁc speed and delegating
decisions about speed or aggression to the human users of these vehicles.
Drivers, however, currently behave in ways that are neither lawful nor reasonable [2].
They drive too fast for conditions, they follow other vehicles too closely, and they fail to
yield the right of way to pedestrians. They drive while intoxicated or distracted. They fail
to properly maintain their vehicles’ tires, brakes, and lights. These largely unlawful
behaviors occasionally result in crashes, and those crashes occasionally result in serious
27
Regulation and the Risk of Inaction
581
injury. This tragic status quo suggests that the current approach to trafﬁc enforcement
should be reformed rather than transferred to automated vehicles.
At this early stage in automation, transportation authorities would do better to optimize
and then enforce rules of the road for all motor vehicles. Increasing the expectations
placed on human drivers—by cracking down on speeding, texting, drunk driving, and
other dangerous activities—could increase the appeal of automated vehicles at least as
much as allowing those automated vehicles to speed.
Automated enforcement could be a key tool for increasing compliance. Such
enforcement currently relies both on roadway devices (including speed and red light
cameras) and on in-vehicle devices (including alcohol locks, speed regulators, and pro-
prietary data recorders). Private entities such as ﬂeet managers and insurance companies
already provide some of this enforcement indirectly through private incentives. The
potential proliferation of outward-facing cameras on vehicles and drones in the air might
also facilitate increased public and private enforcement of rules of the road.
Increased enforcement could, on one hand, address equity concerns of discretionary
enforcement and, on the other hand, raise privacy and liberty concerns. While these are
important questions, a status quo in which laws are openly ﬂouted even by the ofﬁcers
enforcing them is one that begs for reform.
Indeed, more consistent and comprehensive enforcement could create pressure for a
careful evaluation of existing law. Better access to and analysis of location-speciﬁc
information about the driving environment (including roadway geometry, pavement,
trafﬁc, and weather) could enable the precise calibration of dynamic speed limits. These
dynamic limits might then be communicated to drivers through variable message signs
and, in the future, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.
Because reasonable speed also depends on the driver and her vehicle, posted limits
might nonetheless have only limited utility. Pursuant to the basic speed law [2], a human
driver should account for each of these variables implicitly and adjust her speed
accordingly. Automated vehicles, however, may account for more of these variables
explicitly—and reasonably.
Consider, for example, the common requirement that the “driver of a vehicle shall yield
the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or …
unmarked crosswalk at an intersection, except as otherwise provided” [27]. Although
pedestrians may not create an “immediate hazard” by “suddenly” leaving the curb [27],
the statutory obligation to yield does suggest one possible bound on vehicle speed.
Imagine a driver traveling down a typical neighborhood street with a parking lane that
provides 3 m between her car and the curb, as shown in Fig. 27.2. Assuming that her view
of the pedestrian is not blocked, what maximum speed will enable this driver to stop for
any pedestrian who, at a walking speed of 1.4 m/s, steps from the curb into the street?
Although stopping sight distance depends on several vehicle, environment, and driver
variables [28], this illustration simpliﬁes these to consider only the driver’s reaction time
and the friction between the tires and the road surface. An average driver with good tires
on a ﬂat dry street might achieve a reaction time of 1 s and a subsequent deceleration rate
582
B.W. Smith
of 5 m/s2, which implies a maximum speed of 20 km/h (13 mph).4 In contrast, a hypo-
thetical automated vehicle reacting twice as fast and braking at 7 m/s2 could reach a
maximum speed of about 40 km/h (25 mph),5 which is a typical residential speed limit
today. In other words, if automated vehicles are traveling slowly on a road, perhaps
conventional vehicles should be traveling even more slowly.
Reasonable speed is also an answer to some, though not all, of the ethical dilemmas
popularly raised in the context of automated driving [29, 30]. Positing a choice between
killing one group of pedestrians and another, for example, fails to account for the pos-
sibility of negating the dilemma simply by driving more slowly. Slower speeds can
increase controllability as well as reduce the magnitude of harm.
Speed is not the only relevant driver action. Tire condition, for example, is an
important consideration in stopping distance, is at least nominally regulated [31], and yet
varies widely within the current vehicle ﬂeet. If the hardware on automated vehicles is
expected to be regularly inspected, so too should the hardware on conventional vehicles.
Moreover, driving imposes environmental costs that are not internalized by vehicle
owners and operators [32]. If automated driving proves to be more fuel efﬁcient than
human driving, a higher fuel tax would also incentivize automation.
In short, reform should seek to more closely align what is lawful with what is rea-
sonable and to more closely align actual driver behavior with both [2]. The expectation
that both automated vehicles and human drivers should behave reasonably is itself rea-
sonable and ultimately advantageous to automated driving.

5Initial speed = rate of deceleration * ((pedestrian speed/orthogonal distance from curb to car) −re-
action time) = (0.7 * 9.8 m/s2) * (((1.4 m/s)/3 m) −0.5 s) = 11 m/s = 41 km/h = 25 mph.

583
27.5.2 Embrace Enterprise Liability
Although vehicle automation will change the way some cases are litigated and resolved,
manufacturers are likely to continue to successfully manage their product liability [1].
Uncertainty about liability is probably more of an impediment to product deployment than
actual exposure to liability—and there are strategies that companies can take to manage
that uncertainty [4].
This conﬁdence, however, is not universal [33]. A more skeptical view even has
precedent: The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 was passed in response to
similar concerns that traditional product liability had rendered some vaccines uneconomic
for their would-be producers. The regime it created “combines procedural and substantive
limitations on conventional tort remedies with an alternative compensation scheme for
probable victims of covered vaccines” [4].
If product liability exposure does impede the deployment of automated vehicles, a
similar regime might be an effective response. However, that is by no means the only
conceivable alternative.
Rather than limiting liability for the manufacturers of automated systems, courts or
legislatures could expand liability for everyone else. This is counterintuitive and, as a
legislative proposal, unlikely to go anywhere. Nonetheless, consider the consequences of
introducing a system of enterprise liability in which manufacturers are liable for all harm
associated with their products. In other words, what would be different if automakers
could be successfully sued for every crash involving their product rather than just the
small fraction in which a vehicle defect contributed to the injury?
Some effects would be undesirable. Automakers might outright refuse to sell their
vehicles in any jurisdiction with enterprise liability. Others would demand higher prices to
cover their increased costs. This could in turn mean less access for consumers, particularly
those with limited resources.
Other effects, however, might arguably be more desirable. No longer would dealers
simply hand over car keys to new buyers. Instead, manufacturers might require these
buyers to complete more thorough driver training customized for the particular vehicle.
Technologies like alcohol-sensing ignition locks and speed regulators might become
standard. Older vehicles might be promptly removed from roads as safer systems are
introduced. A notable result could be safer roads.
Another result could be greater automation: Given the choice between paying for the
mistakes of their own technologies and paying for the mistakes of their disparate cus-
tomers, many companies would likely opt for their technology. Automation would
become a solution to rather than merely a source of litigation.
Even if pure enterprise liability remains a thought experiment, its principles are evident
in other areas relevant to automation. Fleet operators are an attractive market for auto-
mated vehicles in part because they are already liable for injuries caused by the negligence
of their drivers. Automation may also offer near-term ﬁnancial or market advantages to
insurers, which similarly pay for injuries caused by their insured.
584
B.W. Smith
More broadly, as manufacturers gain and assert more control over the products they
have sold through technology and contract, they may also incur greater legal obligations
in tort [4]. These obligations, which might approach enterprise liability without actually
reaching it, could have a similar effect on design decisions. Eventually, selling a vehicle
that lacks safety-critical automation features might itself be unreasonable.
27.6
Conclusion
This chapter began with two fundamental questions: How should risk be allocated in the
face of signiﬁcant uncertainty—and who should decide? Its focus on public actors reﬂects
the signiﬁcant role that legislatures, administrative agencies, and courts will play in
answering these questions, whether through rules, investigations, verdicts, or other forms
of public regulation.
The eight strategies discussed above would in effect regulate that regulation. They seek
to ensure that those who are injured can be compensated, that any prospective rules
develop in tandem with the technologies to which they would apply, that reasonable
design choices receive sufﬁcient legal support, and that conventional driving is subject to
as much scrutiny as automated driving. Table 27.2 summarizes.
This focus on public actors does not diminish the important roles that private actors
play in innovation and in regulation. Indeed, several of the strategies discussed above
expressly embrace these roles. In this spirit, a challenge for—and to—developers of
automated systems is to contribute fully and publicly to the broader discussions for which
these strategies are intended.

Development and Approval of Automated
Vehicles: Considerations of Technical,
Legal, and Economic Risks
Thomas Winkle
28.1
Introduction
Sensor technology and data processing are constantly improving in their performance.
This enables both: continuous further development of driver assistance systems and
increasing automation of the driving task, right up to self-driving vehicles [1].
In the following chapter the author traces the technical improvements in vehicle safety
over recent decades, factoring in growing consumer expectations. Considering Federal
Court of Justice rulings on product liability and economic risks, he depicts requirements
that car manufacturers must meet. For proceedings from the ﬁrst idea until development to
sign, he recommends interdisciplinary, harmonized safety and testing procedures. He
argues for further development of current internationally agreed-upon standards including
tools, methodological descriptions, simulations, and guiding principles with checklists.
These will represent and document the practiced state of science and technology, which
has to be implemented in a technically viable and economically reasonable way.
28.1.1 Motivation
In the course of this development, technical, especially electrical/electronic systems and
software are becoming far more complex in the future. Therefore, safety will be one of the
key issues in future automobile development and this results in a number of major new
challenges, especially for car manufacturers and their developers. In particular, changing
vehicle guidance from being completely human-driven, as it has so far been, to being

highly or fully automated, raises fundamental questions regarding responsibility and
liability. This calls for new approaches—ﬁrst and foremost new safety and testing con-
cepts [2]. From the legal point of view, automated vehicles require protective safety
measures in the development process [3]. The remaining risk must be accepted by users.
According to a judgment by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, or
BGH), such vehicles must be possible to construct—within the limits of what is techni-
cally possible and economically reasonable—according to the respective current
state-of-the-art, state-of-science, and must enter the market in a suitably sufﬁcient form to
prevent damage [4].
28.1.2 Questions of Increased Automation’s Product Safety
Media reports on car manufacturers, suppliers and IT companies’ automated research
vehicles have predicted for years the preparation for the development of self-driving
vehicles, produced in series. Several things still need to be in place however, before these
vehicles can be launched on the market. Increasing automation of vehicle guidance calls
for
cutting-edge,
highly
complex
technology.
Particularly
with
the
use
of
electric/electronic hard- and software, unforeseeable reactions have to be expected, which
in the worst cases may even be danger to life and limb. Due to the growing complexity,
fully automating all driving tasks in driverless vehicles (see [3])—without a human driver
as a backup—currently involves risks, which are difﬁcult to assess. In addition, there are
new liability questions and limited tolerance for technical failure. While over 3000 deaths
in road trafﬁc currently seem to be acceptable to society in Germany, there is likely to be
zero tolerance for any fatal accident involving presumable technical failure. Although
automation in driving promises considerable potential safety beneﬁts, the comprehensive
commercialization of driverless vehicles can only take place when questions surrounding
who is liable and responsible for damage caused by technological systems have been
clariﬁed. Acceptance by society may only occur when amongst other things, the beneﬁts
perceived by the individual clearly exceed the experienced risks.
An in-depth analysis of automated vehicles’ risks to be considered, based on many
years’ experience in research and product liability, will provide basics for preparing their
future series development and commercialization. From this, recommendations for safety
assessment will be concluded. To date, amongst others, the following questions remain
unsolved:
– How safe is safe enough?
– How is the duty of care assured during development?
– What requirements need consideration when developing and marketing safe automated
vehicles?
– Under what conditions is an automated vehicle considered defective?

28.1.3 Technical Continued Development of Assistance
Systems—New Opportunities and Risks
From a technical point of view, automated vehicles are presently already able to autono-
mously take-over all driving tasks in moving trafﬁc. Current series-production vehicles
with an optimized sensor, computer, and chassis technologies enable assistance systems
with increasing greater performance. Some of the driver-assistance systems on the market
today give warning when they recognize dangers in parallel or cross trafﬁc (Lane Departure
Warning, Collision-, Lane Change-, Night Vision- and Intersection-Assistance). Others
intervene in the longitudinal and lateral dynamics (e.g. anti-lock braking—ABS, Electronic
Stability Control—ESC, Adaptive Cruise Control—ACC). Active parking/steering assis-
tance systems provide increased convenience by interventions of steering and braking at
low speeds. These partially automated vehicle systems, with temporary longitudinal and
lateral assistance, are currently offered for series-production vehicles, but exclusively on
the basis of an attentive driver being able to control the vehicle. Supervision by a human
driver is required. During normal operation at and beyond the system limits, the system
limits or failures of these Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, or ADAS, are thus
compensated by the proof of controllability due to the driver (see [5, 6]).
For fully automated driving on the other hand, the driver is no longer available as a
backup for the technical limits and failures. This replacing of humans, acting by their own
responsibility, with programmed machines goes along with technical and legal risks, as
well as challenges for product safety. However, future expectations regarding driverless
vehicles—even in a situation of possible radical change—can only be described as using
previous experience. Analogies based on past and present expectations concerning vehicle
safety will therefore be examined in the following section.
28.2
Expectations Regarding Safety of Complex Vehicle
Technology
28.2.1 Rising Consumer Expectations for Vehicle Safety
Fully automated vehicles must be measured against today’s globally high level of consumer
awareness in vehicles’ failures. Since 1965, critical awareness regarding the car industry has
evolved more and more, strengthened by the book Unsafe at Any Speed—The Designed-In
Dangers of the American Automobile [7, 8]. In this publication, the author Ralph Nader
blamed car makers for cost savings and duty-of-care breaches at the expense of safe con-
struction and production. With its presentation of safety and construction deﬁciencies at
General Motors and other manufacturers, the book’s content scared the public. Nader went
on to found the Center for Study of Responsive Law, which launched campaigns against the
“Big Three” automobile manufacturers in North America, Volkswagen and other car
28
Development and Approval of Automated Vehicles …
591
companies. Technical concepts were subsequently reworked and optimized. At the center of
Nader’s criticism was the Chevrolet Corvair. Amongst other things, Nader criticized the
unsafe vehicle dynamics resulting from the rear-mounted engine and swing axle. Under
compression or extension, it changed the camber (inclination from the vertical axis). By a
design modiﬁcation into an elastokinematic twist-beam or a multilink rear suspension, the
inclination remains largely unchanged, which results in more stable driveability and han-
dling. Later, the VW Beetle also came under ﬁre for similar reasons due to its sensitivity to
crosswinds. It was also designed with a rear-mounted engine and a swing axle. As a technical
improvement VW therefore replaced the Beetle with the Golf, with a front engine,
front-wheel drive and more stable handling (market introduction 1974).
Besides the development of new vehicles that were of better design and drove more
safely, a further consequence of this criticism was the establishment of the US National
Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA), located within the Department of
Transportation. Based on the Highway Safety Act of 1970, it improves road trafﬁc safety.
It sees its task as protecting human life, preventing injury, and reducing accidents. Fur-
thermore, it provides consumers with vehicle-speciﬁc safety information that had previ-
ously been inaccessible to the public. Moreover, the NHTSA accompanies numerous
investigations of automobile safety systems to this day. Amongst other things, it has
actively promoted the compulsory introduction of Electronic Stability Control (ESC).
Parallel to NHTSA activities, statistics from the German Federal Motor Transport
Authority (Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, or KBA) also show increasingly sensitive ways in
handling safety-related defects, by supporting and enforcing product recalls [9]. Fur-
thermore, there are now extremely high expectations for vehicle safety. This also can be
seen in the extensive safety equipment expected today in almost every series production
vehicle across the globe. It includes anti-lock braking (ABS), airbags, and Electronic
Stability Control (ESC). The frequency of product recalls has increased, despite passenger
vehicles’ general reliability and functional safety noticeably rising at the same time.
Endurance tests in trade magazines such as Auto Motor und Sport show that a distance of
100,000 km can be obtained more often without any breakdowns, unscheduled time in the
garage, or defective parts, and without any defect.
28.2.2 Risks and Benefits of Automated Vehicles
Automated vehicles will arguably only gain acceptance within society when the perceived
beneﬁt (depending on the degree of efﬁciency: “driver” versus “robot”) outweighs the
expected risks (depending on the degree of automation: “area of action” versus “area of
effectiveness”). In order to minimize the risks, manufacturers carry out accident-data
analysis and corresponding risk management (see Fig. 28.1).
592
T. Winkle
For car manufacturers and their suppliers, automated vehicles are an interesting product
innovation with new marketing possibilities. Investment decisions and market launches
however involve risks that are difﬁcult to assess:
– What risks exist for product liability claims when autonomous vehicles do not meet the
requirements of a safe product?
– Which failures may lead to product recalls?
– Will the brand image be sustainably damaged if the automated vehicle does not
comply with consumer expectations?
28.3
Legal Requirements and Effects
Society’s and individual expectations of technical perfection in vehicles are rising. Higher
demands in vehicle quality and functions also call for corresponding safety measures when
rolling out automated vehicles. This for example can be seen in the increase of recall
campaigns despite increasing technical vehicle-reliability or additional requirements and
standards. Applicable comprehensive safety campaigns, such as the Motor Vehicle Safety
Defects and Recalls or new obligations for documentation by public authorities also indicate
increasing requirements. One example of the latter is the Transportation Recall Enhance-
ment, Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act in the USA [10], which introduced
a series of new and extensive obligations for documentation and report-keeping for the
National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA). At the same time, human errors
in road trafﬁc are sanctioned individually, without bringing the whole road transport system
itself into question.
Highly complex technologies and varying deﬁnitions slow down any launch of auton-
omous vehicles. In addition, the interdisciplinary context contains various technical
guidelines. Developers used to be able to get their speciﬁcations with standards or guidelines

such as “generally accepted good engineering practice”, “generally recognized and legally
binding codes of practice”, “industry standards”, or the “state of the art.” With its decision of
06/16/2009, the German Federal Supreme Court of Justice (BGH) wanted to ramp up
requirements for the automotive industry and surprisingly shaped the term “latest state of the
art and science”. This creates additional challenges for developers. Functions that are cur-
rently feasible in research vehicles for scientiﬁc purposes are under laboratory conditions far
from fulﬁlling expectations for series production vehicles, e.g. protection from cold, heat,
vibrations, water, or dirt.
From a developer’s point of view, these legal requirements for a careful development
of new complex systems can only be fulﬁlled after validation tests. These should ideally
be internationally harmonized and standardized. The German BGH judgment from 2009
explained these development requirements—excluding economic and technical suitability
for production—with “… all possible design precautions for safety …” based on
“state-of-the-art and science” [4] on the basis of an expert opinion for the preservation of
evidence. This opinion, however, requires ultrasound sensors as redundancy for recog-
nition of critical objects to trigger airbags. It should be possible, “… to attach ultrasound
sensors around the vehicle which sense contact with an object and are in addition veriﬁed
by existing sensors before airbag deployment …” [4].
This expert opinion for the preservation of evidence however from an engineering
point of view is more than questionable, as current sensor designs only permit a range of a
few meters in series production vehicles. Subject to the current state of the art, the
application of ultrasonic sensor systems is limited to detecting static surroundings at slow
speeds in the scope of parking assistance. The sensors’ high-frequency sound waves can
be disturbed by other high frequency acoustic sources such as jackhammers or trucks and
buses’ pneumatic brakes, which can lead to false detections. Also poorly reﬂecting sur-
faces will not lead to a reﬂection of sound waves. Object recognition is then entirely
excluded [11]. Furthermore, the lawsuit ﬁnally concluded that the sensor system con-
cerned worked error-free according to the technical speciﬁcation.
In addition, the previous fundamental BGH judgment requires that risks and beneﬁts be
assessed before market launch:
Safety measures are required which are feasible to design according to the state of the art and
science at the time of placing the product on the market … and in a suitable and sufﬁcient
form to prevent damage. If certain risks associated with the use of the product cannot be
avoided according to state of the art and science, then it must be veriﬁed - by weighing up the
risks, the probability of realization, along with the product beneﬁts connected – whether the
dangerous product can be placed on the market at all. [4]
28.3.1 Generally Accepted Rules of Technology
An interpretation of the term “generally accepted rules of technology” (allgemein
anerkannte Regeln der Technik, or aaRdT) as a basic rule was shaped in a German
594
T. Winkle
Imperial Court of Justice (Reichsgericht) judgment from 1910 based on a decision from
1891 during criminal proceedings concerning Section 330 of the German Penal Code (§
330 StGB) in the context of building law:
Generally accepted rules of technology are addressed as those, resulting from the sum of all
experience in the technical ﬁeld, which have been proven in use, and wherever correctness
experts in the ﬁeld are convinced.
In various legal areas, they have different meanings. In terms of product liability,
generally accepted rules of technology concern minimum requirements. Noncompliance
to the rules would indicate the required safety has not been reached. They are described in
DIN-VDE regulations, DIN standards, accident prevention regulations, and VDI guide-
lines, amongst others [12].
28.3.2 The Product Safety Law (ProdSG)
The German Product Safety Law (Produktsicherheitsgesetz, or ProdSG), in its revised
version of 11/08/2011 establishes rules on safety requirements and consumer products. Its
predecessor was the Equipment and Product Safety Law (Geräte- und Produktsicher-
heitsgesetz, or GPSG) of 01.05.2004, which in turn had replaced the Product Safety Law
(Produktsicherheitsgesetz, or ProdSG) of 22.04.1997 and the Equipment Safety Law
(Gerätesicherheitsgesetz, GSG) of 24.06.1968. Section 3 GSG it describes the general
requirements for providing products on the market:
A product may … only be placed on the market if its intended or foreseeable use does not
endanger the health and safety of persons. [13]
28.3.3 The Product Liability Law (ProdHaftG)
Independent of its legal basis for a claim, the term “product liability” commonly refers to a
manufacturer’s legal liability for damages arising from a defective product. A manufac-
turer is whoever has produced a ﬁnal product, a component product, a raw material, or has
attached its name or brand name to a product. For product liability in Germany, there are
two separate foundations for claims. The ﬁrst basis is fault based liability, as found in
Section 823 of the German Civil Code (BGB) [13]; the second is strict liability regardless
of negligence or fault related to the tortfeasor, as contained in the Product Liability Law.
Section 1 of the Product Liability Law (ProdHaftG—Law Concerning Liability for
Defective Products) of 12/15/1989 describes the consequences of fault as:
If a person is killed or his or her body or health injured, or if property is damaged, due to a
defect of a product, the manufacturer of the product is thus obliged to compensate the injured
parties for any losses. [14]
28
Development and Approval of Automated Vehicles …
595
Independently of whether the product defect is caused intentionally or through negli-
gence, a defect is deﬁned in Section 3 of ProdHaftG as follows:
A product is defective when it is lacking safety which the public at large is entitled to expect,
taking into account the presentation of the product, the reasonably expected use of the product
and the time when the product was put into circulation. [14]
Should damage arise from a defective product, the Product Liability Law regulates the
liability of the manufacturer. Firstly, this entails potential claims of civil liability for
property damage, ﬁnancial losses, personal injury, or compensation for pain and suffering.
Liability rests primarily with the manufacturer. In justiﬁed cases suppliers, importers,
distributors, and vendors may also be made liable without limitation. Furthermore, in
cases of legally founded criminal liability, there may also be particular consequences for
top management or individual employees, if it is proven that risks were not minimized to
an acceptable level (see Fig. 28.3). In cases of serious fault or depending on the offense as
negligence, this may involve criminal personal proceedings against a developer.
Besides the potential legal consequences, manufacturers must also expect considerable
negative economic effects. Negative headlines in the media can lead to substantial loss in
proﬁts or revenue, damage to image, loss in trust and consequently loss of market share.
Therefore, when developing new systems, both consequences of potentially legal and
economic risks must be considered. Figure 28.2 gives an overview of the potential effects
of failures in automated vehicles.

28.4.1 Experience from Product Crises
In the future, safe automated vehicles will further depend on integrated quality manage-
ment systems [15, 16] and safe interactions [17]. In the past, advanced and successful
vehicles were frequently affected by product crises.
28.4.1.1
Defective Supplier Parts and -Systems
The following examples document how supplier parts and -systems triggered extensive
product crises.
The Ford Explorer was the worldwide best-selling sports utility vehicle. In the USA in
May 2000, the NHTSA contacted both the Ford and Firestone companies due to a con-
spicuously high rate of tires failing with tread separation. Ford Explorers, Mercury
Mountaineers, and Mazda Navajos were affected. All were factory-ﬁtted with Firestone
tires. At high speeds, tire failures led to vehicles skidding out of control and rollover
crashes with fatal consequences. Firestone tires on Ford Explorers were linked to over 200
fatalities in the USA and more than 60 in Venezuela. Ford and Firestone paid 7.85 million
dollars in court settlements. Overall compensation and penalties in total amounted to
369 million dollars. In addition to recalling several million tires at great expense, com-
munication errors were made during the crisis: the managers responsible publicly blamed
each other. This shattered friendly business relations between the two companies that
dated back over 100 years. Harvey Firestone had sold Henry Ford tires for the production
of his ﬁrst car as long ago as 1895. As the crisis progressed it led to serious damage to the
companies’ images, with sales collapsing for both parties [18].
General Motors (GM) announced a further example of defective supplier parts in
February 2014. As a consequence of the ﬁnancial crisis, the car company had been on the
brink of bankruptcy in 2009. It returned to proﬁt for the ﬁrst time, and won awards for its
new models, after a government bailout. But the ignition switches on some models had
seemingly been too weakly constructed since 2001, which meant the ignition key
sometimes jumped back to the “Off” position while driving. When this happened, not only
did the motor switch off, but the brake booster, power steering, and airbags also became
deactivated. GM engineers were accused of having ignored the safety defect in spite of
early warnings for more than ten years. The company has therefore already been ﬁned 35
million dollars for a delayed recall and now faces billions of dollars of damages claims
from accident victims and vehicle owners after mass product recalls [19].
Another huge airbag recall campaign by NHTSA involved 11 different vehicle manu-
facturers and more than 30 million vehicles only in the United States. Airbag Inﬂators
supplied by Takata ignited with explosive force. The inﬂator housing in some cases under
persistent high humidity as well as high temperature conditions could rupture with metal
28

shards spraying throughout the passenger cabin and injured or killed car occupants. Several
fatalities and more than 100 injuries have been linked to this case which imposed a record
civil penalty of 200 million dollar. The airbags were installed worldwide in vehicles from
model year 2002 through 2015. Despite these injury risks the Department of Transportation
estimated that between 1987 and 2012 frontal airbags have saved 37,000 lives [20].
28.4.1.2
Alleged Sudden Unintended Accelerating or Decelerating
Vehicles
Vehicles that automatically intervene in longitudinal and lateral guidance hold consid-
erable risks and provide a target for those who assert that vehicles steer, accelerate and
decelerate in unintended, unexpected or uncontrolled ways. The accusation of unintended
acceleration due to alleged technical defects has already found some car manufacturers in
the media’s crossﬁre. Mainly in the USA, vehicles with automatic transmission are said to
have accelerated in an unintended manner by themselves, causing fatal accidents. Affected
drivers have initiated waves of lawsuits lasting for decades.
One example of this were the accusations against Toyota, a globally successful
company known for quality. Toyota came off very well in customer-satisfaction studies by
the American market research ﬁrm J. D. Power and Associates in 2002, 2004, and 2005.
In 2009, however, it faced accusations of alleged, unintended and sudden accelerating
vehicles. These were initially triggered by single incidents of sliding ﬂoor mats, which had
supposedly been responsible for gas pedals getting jammed. It was then argued that
vehicles would have accelerated unintentionally while driving due to the mechanically
jammed gas pedals. As Toyota had not responded to the allegations quickly enough in the
eyes of the NHTSA, the company was accused of covering up safety problems linked with
more than 50 deaths. As well as compensation payments, Toyota had to pay the authority
penalties of 66.15 million dollars. This was followed by extensive product recalls, claims
for damages and a record 1.2 billion dollar criminal penalty [21].
A further instance of a proven technical defect that led to unwanted accelerations can
be seen in an NHTSA recall action in June 2014. The software problem occurred in some
Chrysler Sport Utility Vehicles (SUV). When optional adaptive cruise control was acti-
vated and the driver temporarily pressed the accelerator pedal to increase (override)
vehicle’s set speed more than the cruise control system would on its own, the vehicle
could continue to accelerate brieﬂy after the accelerator pedal was released again. In this
case and according to technical requirements the vehicle has to decelerate to the requested
set speed. There were no accident victims to lament. The short-notice initiated recall was
restricted to a mere 6042 vehicles [22].
Other great challenges already occurred because autonomous braking systems decel-
erated in some individual cases without a visible reason for the driver and put vehicles at
risk of a rear-end collisions. However, automatic braking and collision warning systems
have great potential in reducing road accidents and saving lives. After recognizing a
relevant crash object they can automatically apply the brakes faster than humans, slowing
the vehicle to reduce damage and injuries. Therefore these systems are recommended to
598
T. Winkle
be made standard equipment on all new cars and commercial trucks. Since November
2013 EU legislation has mandated Autonomous Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) in
different stages with respect to type-approval requirement levels for certain categories of
motor vehicles to cover almost all new vehicles in the future [23].
According to NHTSA, the Japanese car manufacturer Honda Motor Company had to
recall certain model year 2014–2015 Acura vehicles with Emergency Braking. The reason
was that the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) may inappropriately interpret
certain roadside infrastructure such as iron fences or metal guardrails as obstacles and
unexpectedly apply the brakes [24]. Furthermore NHTSA investigated complaints
alleging unexpected braking incidents of the autonomous braking system in Jeep Grand
Cherokee vehicles with no visible objects on the road [25].
Another recall of Chrysler vehicles from 2015 July 24 was, in accordance with NHTSA
the ﬁrst, caused by a software hack. US researchers brought a moving Chrysler Jeep under
their control from afar, which forced the company to recall and ensure cyber-security of
their onboard software. The affected vehicles were equipped with Uconnect radio enter-
tainment systems from Harman International Industries. Software vulnerabilities could
allow third-party access to certain networked vehicle control systems via internet.
Exploitation of the software vulnerability could result in unauthorized manipulation and
remote control of certain safety related vehicle functions—such as engine, transmission,
brakes and steering—resulting in the risk of a crash [26].
In addition to the increase of recall actions the costs for penalties have increased
signiﬁcantly. In 2014 alone, NHTSA issued more than 126 million dollars in civil
penalties, exceeding the total amount collected by the agency during its forty-three year
history.
Many new technological risks for automated functions in future may not be visible
during development and testing. These issues arise in real-life trafﬁc situations and
developers have to make necessary changes to the technology ensuring real world trafﬁc
safety (see Sect. 28.4.7).
28.4.2 Essential Questions from Previous Product Liability Cases
The author’s own experience of previous product liability cases has shown that inter-
disciplinary structured development is a minimum requirement, especially for safe auto-
mated vehicles (see Sect. 28.4.6). In case of damage, the following questions are the key
for avoiding civil and criminal claims:
– Before developing a new product, has it already been checked for potential faults—
under consideration of the risks, the likelihood of their occurrence, and the beneﬁts—
whether the vehicle can be type-approved to be licensed for road trafﬁc use in the
intended technological speciﬁcation?
28
Development and Approval of Automated Vehicles …
599
Essentially, besides general type approval requirements, no globally agreed upon and
harmonized methods for fully automated vehicles exist today. These can be generated
using international legally binding development guidelines with checklists—similar to the
RESPONSE 3—ADAS Code of Practice for the Design and Evaluation of Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS with active support for lateral and/or longitudinal
control”) [5] linked
to ISO 26262 [27] (Section 3, Concept phase, Page 24,
Controllability):
– What measures beyond purely legal framework were taken to minimize risk, damage,
and hazards?
Future guidelines will either be orientated towards today’s requirements or to a large
extend adopt them. The methods for evaluating risk during development (see Sect. 28.4.4)
ensure that no unacceptable personal dangers are to be expected when using the vehicle.
Therefore the general legally valid requirements, guidelines, standards and procedures
during the development process must at the very least, take into consideration as a
minimum requirement:
– Were generally accepted rules, standards, and technical regulations fulﬁlled?
Only complying with current guidelines is usually insufﬁcient. Furthermore it raises the
following questions:
– Was the system developed, produced, and sold with the required necessary care?
– Could the damage that occurred have been avoided or reduced in its effect with a
different design?
– How do competitors’ vehicles behave, or how would they have behaved?
– Would warnings have been able to prevent the damage?
– Were warnings in the user manuals sufﬁcient or additional measures required?
Whether an automated vehicle has achieved the required level of safety or not can be
seen at the end of the development process:
– Was a reasonable level of safety achieved with appropriate and sufﬁcient measures in
line with state of the art and science at the time it was placed on the market?
Even after a successful market introduction, monitoring of operation is absolutely
necessary. This is still the case when all legal requirements, guidelines, and quality
processes for potential malfunctions and safe use of the developed automated vehicle
functions have been complied with. The duty to monitor is the result of the legal duty to
maintain safety as found in Section 823 Paragraph 1 of the German Civil Code
(BGB) [13], where breach of duty triggers liability for any defect that should have been
recognized as such. This raises the concluding question for product liability cases:
– Was or is the automated vehicle being monitored during customer use?

28.4.3 Potential Hazard Situations at the Beginning
of Development
The day-to-day experience of our technologically advanced society shows: risks and risky
behavior are an unavoidable part of life. Uncertainty and imponderables are no longer
seen as fateful acceptable events but rather as more or less calculable uncertainties [28].
The result of this are higher demands referring to risk management for the producers of
new technologies.
A structured analysis of the hazards in consideration of all possible circumstances can
help to give an initial overview of potential dangers. Therefore, in the early development
stages it makes sense to provide a complete speciﬁcation of the automated vehicle, to
ensure a logical hazard analysis and subsequent risk classiﬁcation (see Sect. 28.4.4).
On this basis, it is possible for an interdisciplinary expert team (see Fig. 28.6) to draw
up a list of well-known potentially dangerous situations at the start of a project. This
usually leads to a large number of relevant situations. Due to practical considerations,
scenarios for expert assessment and testing should later be restricted to the most relevant
(e.g. worldwide relevant test scenarios based on comprehensively linked up geographi-
cally deﬁned accident-, trafﬁc-ﬂow- and weather data collections, see Chap. 17).
According to the system deﬁnition, it is recommended to initially gather situations in a
list or table. This should take the following into consideration:
– When should the automated function be reliably assured (normal function)?
– In what situations could automation be used in ways for which it is not designed for
(misinterpretation and potential misuse)?
– When are the performance limits for the required redundancy reached?
– Are dangerous situations caused by malfunctioning automation (failure, breakdown)?
Jointly drawing up a maximum number of dangerous situations relevant to the system
makes it likely that no potential major hazard is omitted or forgotten. Summarizing the
hazards with direct impact on safety is recommended as a next step. After cutting the
situations down to those that are actually safety-relevant, will technical solutions then be
developed.
28.4.4 Methods for Assessing Risks During Development
In discussing phasing out nuclear energy, a German Federal Government publication
states that German society—as a “community with a common destiny” and as part of the
“global community of risk”—wishes for progress and prosperity, but only accompanied
by controllable risks [29]. This is surely only partially transferable to road trafﬁc, where
risks of automated vehicles are limited—in contrast to nuclear energy - to a manageable
group of people. However, the speciﬁc requirements for the methods used in analyzing
and assessing risks are similar. Five common methods are outlined below.
28
Development and Approval of Automated Vehicles …
601
28.4.4.1
Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
The hazard-analysis and risk-assessment procedure (H&R) is described and annotated in
ISO 26262 Part 3 for functional safety of complex electrical/electronic vehicle systems as
well as in the related ADAS Code of Practice for the development of active longitudinal
and lateral functions (referenced in ISO 26262-3, Concept phase) [5, 6]. Parts of the
methods given as examples in the following section (HAZOP, FMEA, FTA, HIL) also
point to the H&R. Aim of H&R is to identify the potential hazards of a considered unit, to
classify them, and set targets. This will enable dangers to be avoided, thus achieving a
generally acceptable level of risk. In addition, an “item” is judged on its impact on safety
and categorized to an Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL). An “item” is deﬁned in
ISO 26262 as a complex electrical/electronic system or a function that may contain
mechanical components of various technologies. The ASIL is ascertained through a
systematic analysis of possible hazardous situations and operating conditions. It also
involves an assessment of accident severity levels via Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) [30]
in connection with the probability of occurrence. A reduction to an assumed hardware
mean safety failure rate, e.g. ASIL D: < 10−8 h−1, for a social and individual accepted risk
(see Fig. 28.3) is achieved with external measures [27].
Basically, risk R can be expressed for an analytical approach as function F of the
frequency f with which a hazardous event occurs, and the potential severity of harm S of
the resulting damage:

The frequency f with which a hazardous event occurs is in turn inﬂuenced by various
parameters. One essential factor to consider is how often or how long a person is in a
situation where a hazard can occur (E = exposure). Another inﬂuence on whether a
hazardous event occurs, is if individuals and road users involved in the accident can react
with timely response, preventing potentially damaging effects (C = controllability).
Controllability via the driver, however, is not present in case of driverless and fully
automated vehicles participating in an accident. The product E × C is a measure of the
probability that a defect has the potential in a certain situation to have a corresponding
impact on the damage described.
A further factor (λ = failure rate) can be traced back to undetected random hardware
failures of system components and dangerous systematic errors remaining in the system. It
gives the frequency of occurrence with regard to E with which the automated vehicle can
trigger a hazardous event itself. The product f thus describes the number of events to be
expected during period E, e.g. kilometers driven or the number of times a vehicle is started.
f ¼ E  k
ð28:2Þ
Furthermore, ISO 26262 stipulates that the Failure in Time (FIT) of technical and
electronic components must also be considered. The unit FIT gives the number of com-
ponents that fail within 109 h.
1 FIT ¼
1 failure
109 hours of device operation
ð28:3Þ
Probability of occurrence f and—where possible—controllability C give the Auto-
motive Safety Integrity Levels: either ASIL rating into B, C (a recommended probability
of occurrence lower than 10−7 h−1, corresponding to a rate of 100 FIT) or D (required
probability of occurrence smaller than 10−8 h−1 corresponding to a rate of 10 FIT). The
highest requirements are thus for ASIL D. Besides normal vehicle operation, ISO 26262
also considers service requirements, up to decommissioning of the vehicle. In this regard,
developers should take the consequences of aging into account when selecting compo-
nents. Control units or sensors must be sufﬁciently protected by robust design in case they
were ﬁtted with age-sensitive electrolytic capacitors for energy reserves. A failure must
not suspend any important functions [27].
28.4.4.2
Hazard and Operability Study—HAZOP
A Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) is an early risk assessment, developed in the
process industry. A HAZOP looks for every imaginable deviation from a process in normal
operation and then analyzes the possible causes and consequences. Typically, a HAZOP
search is carried out systematically by a specialist team from the involved development
units. This is to reduce the likelihood of overlooking any important factors [5].
28
Development and Approval of Automated Vehicles …
603
28.4.4.3
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis—FMEA
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and the integrated Failure Mode, Effects and
Criticality Analysis (FMECA) are methods of analyzing reliability that identify failures
with signiﬁcant consequences for system performance in the application in question.
FMEA is based on a deﬁned system, module or component for which fundamental failure
criteria (primary failure modes) are available. It is a technique for validating safety and
estimating possible failure states in the speciﬁed design-review stage. It can be used from
the ﬁrst stage of an automation system design up to the completed vehicle. FMEA can be
used in the design of all system levels [31, 32].
28.4.4.4
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) involves identifying and analyzing conditions and factors that
promote the occurrence of a deﬁned state of failure that noticeably impacts system per-
formance, economic efﬁciency, safety, or other required properties. Fault trees are espe-
cially suitable for analyzing complex systems encompassing several functionally
interdependent or independent subsystems with varying performance targets. This par-
ticularly applies to system designs needing cooperation between several specialized
technical design groups. Examples of systems where Fault Tree Analysis is extensively
used include nuclear power stations, aircraft, communication systems, chemical and other
industrial processes.
The fault tree itself is an organized graphic representation of the conditions or other
factors causing or contributing to a deﬁned undesired incident, also known as the top
event [5]. One possible approach is to demonstrate the probability of road accidents by the
use of a fault tree which presumes both: inappropriate behavior and the existence of a
conﬂicting object [33].
Figure 28.4 shows an example for a Fault Tree Analysis. A single failure does not
necessarily have dangerous impact. This Fault Tree Analysis demonstrates that trafﬁc
accidents result by the coincidence of several causes. Series of unfortunate circumstances
and inappropriate behavior of trafﬁc participants can worsen the risk situation to be
uncontrollable. Human trafﬁc participants are the crucial link in the chain to prevent a car
crash (see Chap. 17). Especially automated vehicles will require appropriate safety
measures. Figure 28.4 demonstrates an excerpt of safety measures for a safe active
steering as used in automated vehicles.
28.4.4.5
Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Tests
Increasing vehicle interconnection places particular demands on validating the safety of
the entire Electronic Control Unit (ECU) network, e.g. onboard wiring systems safety, bus
communication, vehicle-state management, diagnosis, and ﬂash application’s behavior.
Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) tests can be used as soon as a hardware prototype of the
system or part of it,—e.g. an electronic control unit in a vehicle—is available. As the
Device under Test (DUT), the prototype is placed in a “loop,” a software-simulated virtual
604
T. Winkle
environment. This is designed to resemble the real environment as closely as possible.
The DUT is operated under real-time conditions [34].
28.4.4.6
Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Tests
The method Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) in contrast to HIL, does not use special hardware.
The created model of the software is only converted to the code understandable for the
target hardware. This code is performed on the development computer with the simulated
model, instead of running as Hardware-in-the-Loop on the target hardware. SIL tests must
be applied before the HIL.
28.4.4.7
Virtual Assessment
Virtual assessment veriﬁes prospective, quantitative trafﬁc safety beneﬁts and risks (see
Sect. 28.1.2). They can be quantiﬁed using virtual simulation-based experimental tech-
niques. For this purpose trafﬁc scenarios can be modeled taking into account key
safety-relevant processes and stochastic simulation using large representative virtual
samples. Virtual representations of trafﬁc scenarios are based on detailed, stochastic
models of drivers, vehicles, trafﬁc ﬂow, and road environment, along with their interac-
tions. The models include information from global accident data (see Chap. 17), Field

Operation Tests (FOT), Natural Driving Studies (NDS), laboratory tests, driving simulator
tests, and other sources. Wide ranging, extensive simulations help identifying and eval-
uating safety relevant situations of automated vehicles.
28.4.4.8
Driving Simulator Tests
Driving simulator tests use models of vehicle dynamics and virtual driving scenarios.
They allow artiﬁcial driving situations and repeatable tests with various subjects. Poten-
tially hazardous trafﬁc scenarios can also be tested because in contrast to real driving the
virtual scenario is harmless. Different types of simulators, such as mock-up, ﬁxed based
simulator, or moving base simulator exist. Subjective and objective methods can be used
to measure the performance of test subjects in the driving task. Depending on the kind of
potentially hazardous situations, controllability can be tested by some of these methods.
Typical situations for driving simulator tests are high risk situations, driver take-over
reactions or interaction between automated driving system environment monitoring and
manual human driver mode.
28.4.4.9
Driving Tests and Car Clinics
Driving tests with different drivers provide useful feedback based on empirical data.
Dynamic car clinics allow testing of driver behaviour and performance while driving the
automated vehicle in deﬁned situations within a realistic environment. In a ﬁrst step the
objective is to identify relevant scenarios and environments (see Chap. 17). This makes it
possible to specify and implement virtual tests followed by conﬁrmation via driving tests
and car clinics on proving grounds. Finally, before sign-off and start of production (SOP),
ﬁeld tests conﬁrm identiﬁed scenarios and environments if necessary.
28.4.5 Approval Criteria from Expert Knowledge
During the approval process, test procedures must be provided. Approval criteria in terms
of “passed” and “not passed” are thus recommended for the ﬁnal safety veriﬁcation of
automated vehicles. Regardless of which methods were chosen for ﬁnal sign-off conﬁr-
mation, the experts should all agree on which test criteria sufﬁce for the vehicle to cope
successfully with speciﬁed situations during a system failure or malfunction. Generally
accepted values for achieving the desired vehicle reactions should be used for such
criteria. An evaluation can result by using established methods.
Taking the list of potentially hazardous situations as a basis (see Sect. 28.4.3), test
criteria for safe vehicle behavior, and if possible also globally relevant test scenarios, are
developed by internal and external experts. Of particular importance is a team of system
engineers and accident researchers. The former group offers knowledge of the precise
system functions, time factors, and experience of potential failures, while accident
researchers bring with them practical knowledge of high-risk trafﬁc situations (see
Chap. 17). Every known risky situation that a vehicle can get into must be considered. At
606
T. Winkle
least one corrective action with regard to safety requirements should be speciﬁed by the
developers for the risks identiﬁed. In terms of ﬁnal sign-off conﬁrmation, a test scenario
has thus been “passed” when the automated vehicle reacts as expected or otherwise deals
with the situation in a satisfactory accepted manner.
28.4.6 Steps to Increase Product Safety of Automated Vehicles
in the General Development Process
To guarantee the product safety of automated vehicles, a thorough development concept is
needed that is at least in line with state of the art and science. To this end, a general
development process is proposed below, as is principally in use amongst car manufac-
turers for the development of series production vehicles, partially with small adjustments.
For highly automated vehicles the development refers to measures regarding the safety
process, activities to ensure controllability and appropriate human machine interaction
(see Fig. 28.5).
The generic development process for fully automated vehicle functions even more
focuses on interdisciplinary networking expert knowledge, the safety process and is repre-
sented graphically as a V-Model (see Fig. 28.6). As well as the development stages for the

high automation it depicts logical sequences of product development phases and selected
milestones but not necessarily how long each stage lasts or the time between phases [5, 35].
The process thus forms a simpliﬁed representation in the form of a V-Model. This
allows for iteration loops within the individual development phases involving all parties.
Within this V-shaped process structure (see Fig. 28.6) elements of the safety process are
taken into consideration. In addition, early and regular involvement of interdisciplinary
expert groups is recommended. From the deﬁnition phase until validation, sign-off, and
start of production—interdisciplinary networking experts from research, (pre-)develop-
ment, functional safety, product analysis, legal services, trafﬁc safety, technology ethics,
ergonomics, production, and sales should participate in the development process.
In the development steps for advanced automated vehicles’ product safety functional
safety, stands out as a key requirement. It relates to the whole interaction between the
vehicle and its environment. Safe driver interaction and take-over procedures [1, 36]
should thus be considered when there is an interface necessary to the use case and
functionality. Concerning product safety, fully automated vehicles essentially include the
following ﬁve usage situations: Of prime importance is the functional safety of fully
automated vehicles within, at and also beyond the performance limits. Furthermore,

functional safety should be examined during and after system failures. Careful develop-
ment with regard to a safe usage of driverless vehicles must ensure that they are able to
recognize the criticality of a situation, decide on suitable measures for averting danger
(e.g. degradation, driving maneuver) that lead back to a safe state, and then carry out these
measures.
Figure 28.7 gives an overview of a possible workﬂow regarding ﬁnal sign-off, up to
decommissioning of a vehicle. In the ﬁnal stages of developing an automated vehicle, the
development team decides whether a ﬁnal safety test for validation is required. This serves
to conﬁrm that a sufﬁcient level of safety for production has been reached. For this, the
development team veriﬁes that a vehicle reacts as previously predicted or in other ways
appropriate to the situation. The data used here may come from risk-assessment methods
used during development, such as hazard and risk analysis. There are three equally valid
paths for signing off vehicles. A direct sign-off will be carried out through an
experience-based recommendation of the development team. In addition, ﬁnal evidence of
safety can be passed after corresponding reconﬁrmation via an interdisciplinary forum of
internal and external experts or an objective proof. Evidence of functional safety is pos-
sible via means of a conﬁrmation test with relevant trafﬁc scenarios based on accident-,

The development team chooses an appropriate path for each individual scenario.
A mixed approach is also possible. When the safety team has conclusively conﬁrmed the
safety of the system design functionality, the ﬁnal sign-off can be given (see [5]).
28.4.7 Product Monitoring After Market Launch
Subsequent to the careful development, a manufacturer is obliged to monitor automated
vehicles after placing them on the market, in order to recognize previously unknown hazards
and take necessary additional safety measures. If necessary, car manufacturers are urged to
analyze potential dangers (that can also arise in unintended use or misuse) and react with
appropriate measures, such as product recalls, redesign, or user information (see Fig. 28.7).
A judgment of the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) is often quoted amongst
product safety experts as a particular example of the product-monitoring duty for com-
bination risks with third-party accessories. Model-speciﬁc motorbike handlebar cladding,
from accessories that had ﬁrst been passed by ofﬁcially recognized experts from a testing
organization in June 1977, were supposed to have been responsible for three spectacular
accidents including one fatality. On the day before the fatal accident, the motorcycle
manufacturer in question wrote personal letters to warn all the riders of the affected model
it had on record. The victim, however, never received the letter. Although the motorbike
manufacturer expressly warned of using the cladding, the company was ordered to pay
damages. The BGH’s judgment in the matter established a pioneering principle:
In future, companies will not only be required to monitor the reliability of their products in
practice but, above all, to refer their customers to any hazards in daily operation – including
those that arise from the application or installation of accessories of other manufacturers. [37]
28.4.8 Steps for Internationally Agreed Best Practices
Due to their networking and complexity, it will be difﬁcult to get a clear overview about
all the risks of automated vehicles in series operation. Therefore the objective is estab-
lishing worldwide agreed best practices for legislation, liability, standards, risk assess-
ment, ethics and tests.
The ADAS Code of Practice as a result of the Response 3 project was a fundamental
step towards European agreed and legally binding guidelines for Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems (ADAS). ADAS were characterized by all of the following properties:
They support the driver in the primary driving task, provide active support for lateral and/or
longitudinal control with or without warning, detect and evaluate the vehicle environment,
use complex signal processing and interact direct between the driver and the system [5].
Primarily ADAS operate rule based at the maneuvering level (between about one and ten
610
T. Winkle
seconds) and furthermore within parts of the skill based stabilization level (time spans less
than one second). High and fully automated vehicles will intervene in a knowledge-, skill-
and rule based manner for more than one second at all driving levels (see Fig. 28.8).
In general increasing sensitivity for defects is visible through a signiﬁcant growth in
product recalls worldwide. If unknown failures appear after vehicles have gone into
production, appropriate measures have to be taken where necessary according to a risk
assessment.
For analyzing and evaluating risks stemming from product defects after market launch—
in view of the necessity and urgency of product recalls—the EU and the German Federal
Motor Transport Authority (Kraftfahrtbundesamt) uses tables from the rapid alert system
RAPEX (Rapid Exchange of Information System) [38]. To classify risks, ﬁrst accident

severity (extend of damage S according to AIS, for example) and probability of harm are
assessed—similarly to the ALARP principle (As Low As Reasonably Possible) [39], the ISO
26262 standard [27], and ADAS Code of Practice for active longitudinal and lateral support.
The degree of risk is derived from this. Final assessment concerning the urgency of required
measures looks at the risk of injury for those at particular risk of being injured (as inﬂuenced
by age, state of health, etc.) and hazard for a mentally healthy adult, and the use of protective
measures as appropriate warnings (see Fig. 28.9).
28.5
Conclusion and Outlook
On the one hand, society’s expectations are understandable as they increasingly require
the highest, state-of-the-art levels of safety for new technologies. On the other hand,
unrealistic demands for technical perfection and the striving for 100 % fault-free operation
may hinder automated vehicles being launched on the market, and thus the chance of
revolutionary potential beneﬁts.
Many groundbreaking technologies would not be available to us today had caution and
reservation gained the upper hand during their introduction. One example of courageous
innovation is provided by the German engineer and car pioneer Carl Friedrich Benz. As
early as 1885, he completed the ﬁrst test drives with his prototype, the properly func-
tioning Benz Patent-Motorwagen. In his book Lebensfahrt eines Erﬁnders, Benz
remembers about his ﬁrst trip:
Until that point, it had been at great preference to undertake my test drives far away from the
city – on factory grounds or outside on the old, lonely ramparts (ring road), which at that time
still went around the city of Mannheim and was hardly walked on –, I no longer shied away
from people and their criticism from spring 1886 on. [40]

As the motorcar lay motionless with a breakdown, however, Benz attracted pity, scorn,
and derision:
How can one sit in such an unreliable, squalid, ear-splitting mechanical box. (…) If I had such
a stinking box, I would stay home. [40]
Despite all the denial and rejection with which his unceasing work through countless
nights for his mission of life was received, Benz, with the support of his wife, held ﬁrm to
his belief in the future of his Patent-Wagen. Thus he became a trailblazer for one of the
most signiﬁcant innovations of modern mobility.
The preparation of vehicles with advanced degrees of automation likewise requires a
determined approach in the mold of Benz. The market launch of highly and fully auto-
mated vehicles has also had barriers placed in its path. The ﬁrst vendors on the market—
the pioneers—therefore take on increased risks at the outset, so that the potential total
beneﬁt of these new technologies to society can only be achieved together with all
interdisciplinary networking parties. Homann describes these decision conﬂicts during
market launch by the decision-theory concept of the so-called “Prisoner’s Dilemma”. To
overcome this dilemma as it pertains to highly and fully automated vehicles, the incal-
culable risks for manufacturers must be made assessable and determinable through new
institutional arrangements [41]. Unconditional information and transparent policy
encourage and accelerate public discourse across all disciplines.
Due to previous licensing requirements for series production vehicles, drivers almost
always have to keep their hands on the steering wheel and permanently stay in control of
the vehicle. Automated research vehicles and vehicle development from IT companies, car
manufacturers, and component suppliers will also be required to have a human driver as a
responsible backup level in complex trafﬁc situations for the nearby future.
Driverless vehicles, on the other hand, signify the beginning of an utterly new
dimension. New approaches and activities are essential [42]. It is required to orientate
ourselves to the future potential of automated driving functions, to learn from previous
patterns and within the bounds of what is technically and economically reasonable and
adjust old methods to validly state of the art or state of science [43].
Besides generally clarifying who is responsible for accident and product risks, new
accompanying measures depending on different automation and development levels (see
Fig. 28.6) will also be of use for a successful market launch and safe operation. This
includes identifying relevant scenarios, environments, system conﬁgurations and driver
characteristics. Relevant maneuvers of driving robots have to be deﬁned and assessed for
example using accident data (see Chap. 17) and virtual methods. Further investigation of
real driving situations in comparison with system speciﬁcations and additional tests on
proving grounds, car clinics, ﬁeld tests, human driver training or special vehicle studies are
recommended. For the required exchange of information, storage of vehicle data (e.g. Event
Data Recorder) and possible criminal attacks protective technical measures are necessary
(see Chaps. 25, 30). Beside challenging and agreed data protection guidelines [44], experts
in technology ethics will ensure compliance with ethical values (see Figs. 28.3, 28.6, 28.7).

Within this, safety requirements have to be answered in terms of “How safe is safe enough?”
Expert experience can also decisively contribute in increasing safety and meeting customer
expectations for acceptable risks. In light of increasing consumer demands, such experience
—particularly of previous product liability actions—makes a valuable contribution to
improving product safety during development and approval stages.
Before highly complex automated vehicle technologies—which will additionally be
applied in a multi-layered overall system—can go into mass commercialization, inter-
disciplinary concerted development and sign-off processes are required. A reliable eval-
uation for sustainable solutions ready for production demands new harmonized methods
for comparable safety veriﬁcation, e.g. by simulating relevant scenarios [45, 46] including
the planning of ﬁeld tests [47] from worldwide available and combined accident-,
trafﬁc-ﬂow-, weather- and vehicle operation data (see Chap. 17). This also applies to
fulﬁlling legal and licensing regulations, identifying new options for risk distribution (see
[42]), and creating new compensation schemes. To verify the duty of care in existing
quality management systems, it is recommended to further develop experience-based,
internationally valid guidelines with checklists built on the previous ADAS Code of
Practice [5, 48]. These standards will further embody and document state of the art and
science within the bounds of technical suitability and economic feasibility. The former
ADAS Code of Practice was developed to provide safe Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems, with active support of the main driving task (lateral and/or longitudinal control,
including automated emergency brake interventions—AEB), on the market and published
2009 by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). It corresponds
with the ISO 26262 for requirements of electrical, electronic and software components. As
a development guideline it contains recommendations for analysis and assessment of
ADAS-Human-Machine-Interactions with occurrence during normal use and in case of
failure [5, 6]. With increasing level of automation, upgrades of functional safety, con-
trollability (ISO 26262, ADAS Code of Practice) and other standardized methods will be
necessary such as virtual simulation [45, 46]. Today the standards do not cover functional
disabilities for instance misinterpretation of objects, trafﬁc situations and resulting false
positive system interventions. An integral, scenario based approach is recommended
because automated systems will be able to control scenarios. In the event of serious
malfunctions that threaten severe damage, product experts from the development process
should be involved in the study of the causes and be listened to. With regard to future
court decisions, motor vehicle experts who are not directly involved in the development
should acquire the expertise to be prepared for a specialist appraisal of new technologies.
In the development of automated driving, networked thinking covering all disciplines
is required with a ﬂexible, yet structured area for action. So far, the development has
opened up an unknown world with many uncertainties that may cause reservation and
resistance. For a successful launch of automated vehicles ready for production, insights
collected in vivo from both the past as well as the present are essential prerequisites.
Despite the technical, legal, and economic risks, production readiness will be of beneﬁt to
society in this way.

Foreword
Autonomous driving not only poses a challenge in terms of further technological devel-
opment, but also for how the new technical possibilities are received. While media reports
on autonomous driving have increased markedly in recent times, public debate on the
resultant expectations—and fears—is still in its infancy. This chapter examines the
questions and issues preoccupying people in connection with autonomous driving, and
also the experience of introducing new technologies in the past—experience which must
be borne in mind when bringing in autonomous driving. That this book closes with these
questions is not by chance. Technologies are always embedded in a framework that
determines how people use them, what signiﬁcance they ascribe to them, and also what
social functions they fulﬁll. This is also the underlying motivation for beginning this book
with the topic of Human and Machine and ending it with that of Acceptance.
Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving is the subject of Eva
Fraedrich and Barbara Lenz’s article. The authors outline and discuss the multifaceted
nature of acceptance, and attempt to furnish this frequently inﬂationary and sometimes
imprecisely used term with better-founded understanding. What does it actually mean
when people “accept” a new technology? Based on the analysis of reader comments in
German and American media, they demonstrate what topics are currently driving dis-
cussion. This leads them to some striking ﬁndings.
Is the introduction of autonomous driving really comparable with introducing any
major technology? And how do we then deal with the risks that stem, or appear to stem,
from it? In his paper Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving. Analysis,
Historical Context and Assessment, Armin Grunwald examines what risks combine in
autonomous driving and what can be learned from previous experience in risk debates on
technological progress when developing and using autonomous driving. Grunwald
develops a series of recommendations relevant to autonomous driving’s implementation,
and at the same time stresses the necessity of an open and transparent exchange with the
new technology’s potential users and road users as a whole.
Barbara Lenz and Eva Fraedrich
Autonomous driving should not be viewed as a wholly new technology appearing out
of the blue, as it were. Rather, it always builds on what is already there, for example the
current everyday practice of using (individual) vehicles. In light of this, Eva Fraedrich and
Barbara Lenz tackle the topic of Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving
and Car Usage. Based on an empirical examination of the needs, perceptions, and
experiences of car users, they map out the complexity of attitudes towards automating
driving. In particular, they place the reservations held on autonomous driving in context.
They also demonstrate that the way autonomous driving is currently assessed depends
fundamentally on two things: ﬁrst, the social group addressed; second, the speciﬁc use
case or scenario in question.
The acceptance or non-acceptance of autonomous driving will sooner or later manifest
itself in the (private or commercial) purchase or non-purchase of an autonomous vehicle.
How does this impact the signiﬁcance of automobile brands, given the fact that the “new”
car must be able to do more than simply drive? In his article What Drives Consumers’
Purchase Intentions of Automated Driving Technologies? An Examination of Use Cases
and Branding Strategies, David Woisetschläger examines the question of what—from the
perspective of today’s car users—the relevant acceptance criteria might be in future: the
experience of the auto manufacturers or that of software producers. He shows that there
currently is still little readiness to purchase autonomous vehicles, and that this is largely
irrespective of which sector the vehicle has been developed in—it is more important that
the brand which markets the vehicle is a highly trusted one. With his article on individual
consumer acceptance, Woisetschläger concludes this last section of the book, which spans
all aspects of acceptance from the general to the individual.

Introduction
What attitudes and expectations do (potential) future users, and the public at large, bring
to the new technology of autonomous driving? Alongside the technical and legal areas of
research, this question is moving into ever-greater focus. The emerging debates assume
that a switch from conventional to autonomous driving might bring about clear changes
for all road users. From these perspectives—individual users and society—the question of
acceptance arises. To what extent are individuals ready to use fully-automated vehicles,
and to what extent are we as a society prepared to accept a transport system with fully
automated vehicles on the road?
Public interest in autonomous driving has grown appreciably of late—in surveys, a
majority now speak of already having “heard of” autonomous driving (see [2]). In mass
media news coverage, driving’s automation is often portrayed as the solution to many of
our automobile-related transport problems. It is further expected that it will bring about a
revolution in car usage and ownership. The term “autonomous driving,” however, is even

less clearly deﬁned in the public discourse: sometimes the talk is of automated driving and
self-driving or driverless cars, sometimes partly- or fully-automated driving. Frequently, it
is not clear which of the potential transport options is being discussed, what concrete
options, potential, and risks are involved, or what challenges still need to be overcome on
the path to autonomous driving.
The perspectives of road users and potential future users are paid little attention in this,
even if it is constantly stressed that a user- and usage-oriented view can make an essential
contribution to acceptance, and thus also to autonomous vehicles’ success (see [3, 4]).
Acceptance must be brought into the discourse surrounding autonomous driving at an
early stage, even if the realization of road trafﬁc with fully automated vehicles is not
currently conceivable at all. Introducing the technology will potentially bring changes
across the entire sphere of mobility, impacting many levels of society. At the same time, it
could trigger a fundamental transformation in the way we get around. In order to know in
good time what the essential issues are, and to control the transformation where necessary,
it is important to identify the signiﬁcant inﬂuencing factors and understand their
dynamics. One of these factors is the acceptance of technology.
This paper begins with a determination of what is to be understood by (technological)
acceptance, and then discusses which main research areas are relevant in connection with
autonomous driving. The empirical section begins with the results of current studies on
autonomous driving’s acceptance. It then introduces the outcome of our own investigation
looking into the views of today’s road users. This provides ﬁndings for future, more
closely use-oriented empirical analysis on the acceptance of autonomous driving.
29.2
Acceptance
When acceptance is talked of, what is meant in general terms is “agreeing, accepting,
approving, acknowledging; to agree with someone or something” ([5]: 136, translation by
the authors). This formulation encompasses a sense of “willingness for something,” which
bestows an active component on acceptance. This differentiates it from simple acquies-
cence and the absence of resistance, but also from tolerance. Acceptance takes place in the
context of social and technological construction processes—that is, it is dependent on
people, their attitudes, expectations, actions, environment, value- and norm-framing etc.,
but also on changes over time (see [6]). The processual and changeable character of
acceptance makes it overall an “unstable construct” ([7]: 25, translation by the authors)—
one that depends on various speciﬁcities, types, and the subject, object and context of
acceptance. Moreover, it can vary greatly in the course of time [8].
For the acceptance of a speciﬁc technology such as autonomous driving, this means that
various usage options and fears of risk are woven together alongside the technical options,
on both individual and societal levels. In this way, a technology can alter its “original
purpose” over time before ﬁnally stabilizing, or even becoming institutionalized. The ﬁeld
of transport is especially ripe with such examples, starting with the railway originally being
622
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
invented exclusively for goods transportation, right up to using cable cars as public
transportation in densely populated inner cities. This progression from the genesis of a
technology to its adoption poses great challenges for research into acceptance. At each
stage of technology development, implementation and adoption, different stakeholders and
stakeholder groups are variously relevant to acceptance. When viewing acceptance in the
context of such a sociotechnical process of transformation (see [9]), the several stages of
the process must be distinguished between, as their relevance to acceptance always differs.
29.2.1 (Technology) Acceptance: Concepts, Research
and Characteristics
The subject of technology acceptance is a decidedly inhomogeneous ﬁeld; various sci-
entiﬁc disciplines (e.g. psychology, sociology, economics, etc.) are related to and have
mutual bonds with it. Overall, acceptance research is still a relatively young ﬁeld. The
topic ﬁrst came to prominence in the 1970s with broad public opposition to nuclear
energy. This was postulated—rather unjustly, as things have turned out—to indicate
general hostility to technology among Germans (for more on this, see Chap. 30, on risk
analysis and assessment) ([10, 11]: 45 ff).
The aims of acceptance research are, ﬁrstly, a better understanding of particular
acceptance phenomena (social-science/empirical analysis). Secondly, it is to enable
speciﬁc objects of acceptance, e.g. a speciﬁed technology, to be developed and designed
in such a way that acceptance occurs (normative-ethical approaches). At research and
policy
levels
in
Germany,
several
institutions
accompany
the
development
of
(new) technologies and debate surrounding them. They have emerged in parallel with the
various research approaches to meet these requirements ([11]: 47 ff). All institutions share
the basic assumption that technology cannot be viewed removed from its embedding in
social, economic, and also usage-related contexts. In short, technology’s embedment in its
sociotechnical system must also be taken into consideration (see e.g. [11, 12]).
29.2.1.1
Acceptance Subject, Object and Context
Acceptance always takes place within an interplay of subject, object and context (see [13]:
88 ff): “To be stated is not only what is accepted (or refused), but rather what, by whom,
within which society, in what situation, at what time, and for what reason” ([13]: 90,
translation by the authors). Figure 29.1 shows the relationship between the subject, object,
and context of acceptance.
Acceptance subject
An acceptance subject has attitudes, or develops attitudes, in relation to the object of
acceptance, and also links them, where appropriate, with corresponding actions (see [12,
13]). The term “subject” refers here not only to individuals, however, but also groups,
institutions or society as a whole.
29
Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving
623
The acceptance subject of autonomous driving can currently be approximated, for
example, by taking transport system users who will either passively or actively come up
against autonomous driving in future. This covers all of those using the current road
system, be it as car drivers, cyclists or pedestrians. Further relevant acceptance subjects
include developers and engineers, politicians and businesspeople, or even public research
institutes.
Acceptance object
Acceptance object does not necessarily imply a physical object as such, but rather refers to
the adoption of something “on offer, available, or proposed” ([13]: 89, translation by the
authors). This may be engineering or technology, but it could also be artifacts of any type,
or people, attitudes, opinions, arguments, actions, or even the values and norms behind
such things. In turn, such an object acquires its signiﬁcance only from what individuals or
society ascribe to it—there is therefore no such thing as autonomous driving per se.
Rather, the question is what speciﬁc functions autonomous driving can fulﬁll, and what
signiﬁcance individual people and society at large place in the technology. Behind this is
the assumption that engineering and technology have no signiﬁcance in and of them-
selves; instead, this is only attained by the fulﬁlling of social functions, human actions,
and their embedding into social structures (see [9]).
Acceptance context
The acceptance context refers to the environment in which an acceptance subject relates to
an acceptance object—and thus can only be viewed in relation to both. For example, the
context of autonomous driving is determined by the current individual and social sig-
niﬁcance of car usage: Why do people use cars? What attitudes, values, expectations, etc.
inform (auto)mobile praxis? Does autonomous driving ﬁt in here seamlessly—or will it
change the meaning of (auto)mobility and its system of norms?
In the copious literature on acceptance and acceptance research, various dimensions
and levels are identiﬁed where acceptance is visible and, above all, comprehensible. In the
following, we shall take a closer look at the dimensions of attitudes, actions, and values.

object, and context (based on

624
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
29.2.1.2
Dimensions of Acceptance
Attitudes dimension
Attitudes regarding acceptance that can be surveyed include mindsets, values, and
judgments. These can be polled and interpreted on both individual and societal levels.
Attitudes are signiﬁcant for acceptance research, as it is assumed that they can be read as
willingness and intent for concrete actions ([13]: 82 f). Nevertheless, questions on the
genesis of technology, its speciﬁc usage, the associated challenges, and frameworks—all
in their speciﬁc contexts—cannot be captured with such measuring of attitudes ([11]: 46).
A typical measuring instrument of the attitudes dimension of acceptance is the opinion
poll—even though such surveys quickly lead “to a simpliﬁed picture of an opinion-
forming process based on the perceived properties of technology” ([14]: 35, translation by
the authors). This is because they imply that technology sends out signals that spark off set
reactions in the population or individuals. One-dimensional surveying of attitudes has
been replaced in recent years, however, with greater insights into technology acceptance,
and expanded into an analysis that incorporates attitudes’ contexts in particular. In this
way, the focus of acceptance research shifted from the “descriptive inventory of attitudes
and actions” ([14]: 36, translation by the authors) to a more analytically aligned per-
spective. This takes greater account of the complexity in individuals’ perceptions and
evaluations, experts’ subjectivity, and the signiﬁcance of contextuality ([14]).
Actions dimension
The actions dimension of acceptance describes observable behavior, although acting in
this sense may relate either to doing something or to refraining from it. Actions can
manifest themselves in many ways, for instance in purchasing, using, and spreading (or
the opposite, e.g. initiating protests), or in supporting other (decision-making and plan-
ning) activities.
The dimension of actions is often equated with that of acceptance, as found in Lucke,
for example (see [13]: 82). On the other hand, other authors do not view action, or a
concrete intention to act, as imperative for acceptance ([15]: 19, [16]: 11). Schweizer-Ries
et al. ([16]: 11) have depicted this reciprocity between the dimensions of actions and
attitudes in a two-dimensional model (Fig. 29.2).
Values dimension
In many approaches, the values dimension is not viewed as a separate level of acceptance,
but combined with the attitudes dimension. Values and norms, according to this argument,
are also the basis of attitudes and therefore can only be separated from them with difﬁ-
culty. The dimension of values comes into its own, however, when acceptance is visible
on the level of actions, for instance in the use of a speciﬁc product. These actions may
only accord with subjective individual values slightly or not at all—a person can own and
use a car while being strongly ecologically-minded. This, in turn, may show itself more
29
Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving
625
clearly in other areas of activity—for example, by mainly or only shopping in organic
grocery stores. In the context of autonomous driving, ethical criteria and social standards,
which (must) determine how it is viewed, are especially challenging—see Chaps. 4 and 5
in this volume. In general, an acceptance object is also always evaluated in relation to an
existing system of norms and values (see [14]).
29.2.1.3
Research on Acceptance
Acceptance takes place not only on various levels as described above, but is also the result
of a complex individual and collective process of evaluation and negotiation, sometimes
even of relatively unspeciﬁc “sensitivities” ([8]: 55, translation by the authors). This raises
the question of how such a process can be made measurable and thus empirically
accessible. For a relatively new technology such as autonomous driving, this means to
examine in what way individual stakeholders (e.g. users), social groups, organizations,
and institutions meet the challenges of technological and scientiﬁc progress as well as “to
identify the potential for design to meet social challenges and to test technological options
in view of their problem-solving capacity” ([12]: C, translation by the authors).
In summary, we may say that, for acceptance research, acceptance “is a complex,
multilayered construct that is not directly measurable, and for which there are no “cal-
ibrated” measuring instruments” ([12]: 21, translation by the authors). Depending on the
acceptance object in question, but also on the relevant dimensions, only indicators speciﬁc
to each case may be operationalized and rendered measurable—which in turn excludes the
use of others. This should also be reﬂected in the research process.
29.3
Acceptance of Autonomous Driving: The Current State
and Focus of Research
Autonomous driving can be placed alongside products of everyday technology. In contrast
to working technologies and so-called external technologies, such as nuclear power or
satellite technology, everyday technologies mainly involve products for individual
Fig. 29.2 Two dimensions of
the concept of acceptance
(based on [16]: 11)
626
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
consumers, and are controlled by the market. Nonetheless, they can have consequences
for third parties ([14]: 31). Car usage and ownership are typical examples from this area.
Acceptance of technology in this context primarily means purchase, but as a rule also
includes use. Particularly at the beginning of autonomous driving’s potential implemen-
tation, however, it may be assumed that not only the level of private or individual
consumption plays a role, but also that the effects on various social spheres are publicly
discussed and weighed up. This could include questions of whether we can permit
vehicles in our transport system that will probably be involved in accidents just like
conventional vehicles—but with the possible difference that the machine or driving robot
causes the accident, not only endangering its own occupants but all road users. Recently
there has also been the question of the common good (for more on this, see Chap. 30 on
risk analysis and assessment Chap. 4 on the ethics of autonomous driving).
It is possible that autonomous driving may bring with it other social or economic risks
and consequences that could be the subject of public debate. It will thus also be important,
in empirical terms, to demarcate the border between these two spheres—the individual and
the societal aspects of acceptance—as clearly as possible, and to establish “how techno-
logical attributions come about as internally or externally controlled” ([14]: 32, translation
by the authors). In general, no hostility to technology is visible in Germany, and in the
sphere of its individual use, the reverse is even true. To a great degree, many German
households have, and constantly use, everyday technological products (see [10, 17]).
In summary, it is often said of autonomous driving that such vehicles will only be
accepted if, on the one hand, they drive “better” than humans, and on the other, if the
vehicle user can override the autonomous functions as a last line of control (see [4]: 2 ff).
However, Grunwald reports elsewhere in this volume that risk perception is many times
more complex than such statements would have us believe (see Chap. 30).
Analogies to other technologies from these areas, and thus their experience of
acceptance, tend to be difﬁcult to make. Although we already have many examples of
automated transport systems today (for instance airplanes, ships, (metro) trains, and
military vehicles), they all still have humans with authority to supervise or control them.
We do not yet have a vehicle or mobility system without this human authority ([4]: 6). For
this reason, autonomous driving could place unique demands on acceptance.
The question of which factors, characteristics, demands, expectations, value systems,
of whom and to whom, and what, etc. is connected with autonomous driving’s acceptance
—all this has not yet been sufﬁciently empirically recorded. Some studies dealing with the
topic from market and opinion research have found a general and also increasing openness
to autonomous driving (see [2, 18, 19]). But these do not make clear what the respondents
actually understand as “autonomous driving,” in which context their perceptions and
evaluations are embedded, and what challenges and obstacles, and also beneﬁts, may be
identiﬁed in relation to it.
On the user side, surveys directly testing judgments of autonomous driving are cur-
rently also subject to the problem that, to date, neither broad levels of knowledge, nor
concrete experience may be assumed. Attitudes and assessments recorded as such are
29
Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving
627
therefore possibly of only limited validity, for the object of the survey is not yet clearly
deﬁned, as people have hardly encountered it. In their study on acceptance and electric
mobility, Peters and Dütschke suggest the following: “Surveys of potential users, for
instance questionnaires as to whether or under which circumstances they would be
prepared to buy an electric car, have the problem that judgments on the new, still little-
known system of electric mobility are difﬁcult for consumers to make. As a rule, they rest
on a comparison to conventional vehicles on the basis of previous mobility patterns”
([20]: 6, translation by the authors). A comparable assessment can be carried over to
autonomous driving.
The few studies that have considered aspects of autonomous driving’s acceptance give,
in part, quite a heterogenous picture. In their study of active and passive safety systems,
Frost and Sullivan show that the majority of car users to date resist the idea of giving up
control of their vehicle to a machine or robot [21]. Other surveys, on the other hand, have
demonstrated that young drivers between 19 and 31 in particular often ﬁnd driving to be
burdensome—speciﬁcally, driving can stop them addressing other, more important,
meaningful or interesting activities: “Regulation keeps trying to say texting is distracting to
driving but for the consumer it is really the driving that is distracting to texting” ([22]: 2).
A poll of Europeans’ desires for the car of the future also revealed that some two thirds
of respondents are open-minded concerning autonomous driving [18]. Although an
international survey of car drivers in Germany, China, the USA, and Japan found
openness in principle, it also showed that a large number of those questioned in all
countries currently (still) harbor doubts about the technology’s safe operation [19] or are
even rather scared of it [2].
29.4
The Road-User Perspective
Despite the haziness in the empirical methods outlined above, the main questions when
looking at autonomous driving’s acceptance have to be: How is the acceptance object
actually perceived? What acceptance-relevant issues, on either individual or social levels,
are associated with the technology? The aim must be to obtain initial indications as to the
dimensions of attitudes and values regarding acceptance, and to identify the concrete
expectations, hopes, desires, even fears, linked with the development, use, and design of
the technology (see [12]). Within the “Villa Ladenburg” project, the ﬁrst work on indi-
vidual and societal acceptance was therefore an exploratory study that took a broad look at
the point of view of today’s road users—who are also tomorrow’s potential users of
autonomous driving. In the process, essential issues of perceived use from a subjective
perspective were considered. The survey also addressed discernible differences in different
socio-cultural environments—in this case Germany and the USA. These are among the
leading automobile nations, where wide-ranging debates on autonomous driving have
already begun with media coverage of the topic having increased noticeably in the last two
years. This indicates that autonomous driving is gradually gaining the public’s attention.
628
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
29.4.1 Methods
The study analyzed statements from comments on autonomous driving. The method-
ological approach took the form of an analysis of how online articles in widely distributed
print media were received. This reception can be traced in the online comments by the
users. In particular, this approach assumes that media discourse has a critical inﬂuence on
individual and societal opinion forming (see [23]). One criterium in selecting articles was
that the online news portals they were published in should give a representative picture of
the German and US print media landscapes. This permits the assumption that the articles
both reﬂect and help to form the current public discourse on autonomous driving. For
Germany, the comments analyzed were on articles from Bild [24], Die Welt [25],
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung [26], Heise online [27], Spiegel Online [28–30], Süd-
deutsche.de [31] und Zeit Online [32]; for the USA, from the Los Angeles Times [33], NY
Daily News [34], The New York Times [35], San Francisco Chronicle [36], The Wall
Street Journal [37] und The Washington Post [38]. In total, 827 comments on 16 articles
were evaluated. To ensure as great a combarability as possible, most articles concerned
California’s decision at the end of September 2012 to allow Google’s driverless cars onto
its roads. In terms of “conceptual representativeness;” a theoretical sampling was
undertaken ([39]: 154 ff), i.e. in the course of the analysis, comments were analyzed in
stages, which in the end led to three comparison groups: (1) comments from German mass
media portals, (2) comments from US mass media portals and (3) comments from one
technology-centred German portal (Heise online). The evaluation used a qualitative
content analysis following Mayring [40] whose aim is to identify texts’ meanings, par-
ticularly those not immediately apparent. This is done using a systematic and intersub-
jectively
veriﬁable
analysis
that
meets
the
linguistic
material’s
interpretational
requirements and wealth of meaning. The result of the (summary) contents analysis is an
inductively developed category system ([40]: 67 ff). This reﬂects how the topic of
autonomous driving is discussed and negotiated from the online commenters’ point of
view; which issues and features are perceived; and how these are assessed. To this end, all
comments were coded—the smallest coding unit within a comment was one word. A total
of 1,421 codings were made in this way, and in successive steps of reduction and
abstraction, were condensed into the category system.
29.4.2 Results
The category system, consisting of almost 60 categories and subcategories, is divided into
two levels. First there is an object-related level, which is also the more objective of the
two. This encompasses statements that contained (positively and negatively) perceived
features of the technology, as well as connected topics concerning its general and speciﬁc
potential for development, and also those on the legal framework, liability questions, etc.
Such statements are above all oriented around the object of acceptance, and
29

629
simultaneously closely linked to the acceptance context. On the more emotional level, on
the other hand, the question at hand is the subject of acceptance—statements mostly
directly refer to the commenters themselves and contain attitudes, judgments and sub-
jective motivations regarding autonomous driving. These are also essentially strongly
linked to the context of acceptance, for example with the context of car usage and
ownership. Around 15 % of all statements were not applicable to the research object and
therefore were deemed to have no relevance. Figure 29.3 shows the category system and a
reduced graphic overview and Table 29.1 has the percentages of statements on the two
levels as well as the survey’s general ﬁgures.

Object-Related Level
Perceived features and consequences of autonomous driving
Distributed among the three comparison groups (German and US mass media; tech-savvy
Heise online), between 43 and 47 % of all statements were attributable to the object-related
level. Table 29.2 shows a selection of the categories and their percentage distribution. The
comments give concrete expectations in relation to the features of autonomous driving, but
also to the potential changes and consequences for transport and social systems, and in legal
terms. At least two thirds of the anticipated features and consequences have clearly positive
connotations, as many as 70 % in the German-media comments. These may, for example,
refer to expected safety beneﬁts of autonomous driving, which are expected to greatly
reduce, if not completely prevent, road trafﬁc accidents in future. One user puts it thus:

Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving
631
“A car, though, should actually be much safer on the road than with a driver, as it will have
a lot more sensors to see what’s coming, be able to look in all directions at once, and have a
reaction time close to zero.” On the negative side, the main fears revolve around the social
consequences, for instance job losses: “What they are working towards is the abolition of
the German car industry. Nobody is going to buy a Porsche or a nice fat Benz if they will
only get schlepped around like every other Tom, Dick or Harry. […] Losing the German car
industry means ca. 25 % fewer of the most highly qualiﬁed jobs.” Other issues associated
with autonomous vehicles in the statements included—on the positive side—ﬂexibility and
comfort, transport optimization and efﬁciency, integrated transport use (“travel-
strengthening” currently restricted transport users), general progress accompanying tech-
nology, and cost savings. On the negative side, a series of issues were mentioned beyond
fears of social consequences: data misuse; deﬁciencies in the technical infrastructure, i.e. the
assumption that such vehicles will not be safe (enough); increased costs; and relatively
unspeciﬁc uncertainties surrounding the way these vehicles will function. Thus several of
the positively perceived features ﬁnd their negative counterparts here: safety vs deﬁciency
thereof, cost savings vs increased costs, progress vs social consequences.
Liability, insurance, and law
According to our evaluation, liability, insurance, and law are topics of particular concern
in Germany—expected modiﬁcations to the legal framework will also be accompanied by
changes to the insurance set-up. This signals uncertainty for almost half the statements on
this topic on German mass media portals. One user framed it this way: “This car is not a
technological problem, but a legal one. Whose fault is it, then, if the car causes an
accident? The driver’s or Google’s?” A country-speciﬁc problem also materialized in the
US comments, however, albeit often in ironic fashion—the auto insurance and
liability-centered legal profession, seen as being addicted to disputes and litigation, might
stand in the way of a successful roll-out of autonomous vehicles: “Leave it to the trial
lawyers to spoil the party!” was how one commenter summed up this view. Further
discussion on this topic revolved around the necessary future legal changes and devel-
opment of costs.
Development perspectives for autonomous driving
Particularly on the Heise website, many commenters address development perspectives in
the context of autonomous driving which go far beyond features exclusively associated
with technology (54 % of all object-related comments). Such statements may be about
social development in a rather general sense, but also the future development of car usage
and ownership, design and vehicle equipment, the interaction between humans and
machines, and considerations on the future form of transport and urban space. One user,
for instance, touches on the consequences of a changed legal framework: “The question is
no longer ‘who is liable when there are car accidents?’ but rather ‘who will still be
allowed to drive manually?’”

Subject-Related Level
Evaluative attitudes and expectations
As a rule, comments in online forums consist of several statements that can be categorized
to several levels or (sub)-categories—statements on a more “objective” level are often
linked with the more subjective/emotional one. When, for example, negative features are
associated with autonomous driving, commenters likewise tend to take a dismissive stance
to using the new technology, and vice versa: “I don’t want to let the controls out of my
hands! Certainly not to a computer that can be manipulated and hacked, just like PCs and
cellphones!” This statement combines security fears (an autonomous vehicle, similarly to
a computer, will not be entirely secure, data may be misused) with a subjective refusal. On
the other hand, the expectation that autonomous vehicles are especially comfortable and
ﬂexible may accompany positive personal assessments of the technology: “Fully auto-
mated driving with no annoying passengers, no train cancellations and delays—that’d be
really great.” Statements are not always linked on the different levels, however. Judg-
ments can also be made with no further justiﬁcations given, such as this one from US
online portals: “Yes. Easiest question I’ve been asked all day!” or “Jerry, I support you,
but not on this” (“Jerry” refers here to the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, who
accorded Google driverless cars their street-legal status to media fanfare in the Google
headquarters in 2012).
In general, although the technology is clearly positively perceived (see above—“Per-
ceived features and consequences”), it is rather ambivalently-to-negatively assessed (more
than two thirds of all statements in this category do not have positive connotations, see
Table 29.3). Mistrust and skepticism is either related to the technical development, its
whole rationale, or whether it will be possible to bring in the technology at all. The
category of ambivalent statements largely concerns the prerequisites and consequences
(on the technical, social or infrastructural side) deemed essential before assessing
autonomous driving positively.
Car usage and ownership
The perception of autonomous driving is strongly bound up with subjective and personal
motives of individual car use. Our analysis was able to identify two opposite poles in the
assessment of autonomous driving. On one side, there are statements which stressed
motivations for using cars due to their comfort and ﬂexibility, and their “general” beneﬁts.
Such statements also generally contain a rather positive appraisal and assessment of
autonomous driving: “Cars do have, above all, this almost ubiquitous character, because
it is so practical. I would ﬁnd it more practical if I could order such an auto-auto to my
front door online and have it drop me off at any destination without me having to bother
with parking. If this vision of the future becomes possible, then goodbye Porsche!” On the
29
Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving
633
other side, there are statements highlighting issues of freedom, control and the fun of car
driving; most of these are skeptical-to-dismissive of the new technology: “Without driving
by myself, where’s the fun in that? Technology or no technology: I want to give orders to
my car myself, not any computer.” Furthermore, some users discuss in very general terms
which motives and attitudes underlie their car use, or raise the question of why anyone
would (or would not) actually buy a car in a future with autonomous vehicles.
29.4.2.3
Comparing the Groups: Germany, USA and Heise Online
Many perceptions, assessments, perspectives, and value systems showed up in similar
measure in all three groups. However, there are some clear differences in some areas,
which were either speciﬁc to the country or level of knowledge (for Heise online com-
ments, it was safe to assume a far higher level of knowledge on autonomous driving, as
well as understanding of technology and engineering in general). Alongside the
group-speciﬁc topics of development perspectives and liability, insurance and law men-
tioned above, we also saw that US commenters look at autonomous driving in far more
socio-political terms in comparison to their German counterparts (see Table 29.1). Fur-
thermore, evaluating the topic of car use and ownership revealed that fun in driving,
individual freedom, and control of the vehicle are the predominant motivations for car use
among US comments. This is mostly accompanied by an attitude of refusal regarding
autonomous driving (79 % in the USA compared to 43 % of German mass media com-
ments and only 25 % of the tech-savvy posts).

E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
The questions on liability were overall most controversially discussed on Heise online,
while the few statements on this topic on US sites see liability as lying with manufacturers
in future. In contrast, a majority of people (58 %) commenting on Spiegel and co.—that
is, the German mass media—think that liability will also lie with the vehicle owner in
future.
The general tone of German comments is overall somewhat more positive. On both the
Heise website and those of the German mass media, positive features of autonomous
driving were discussed more often than on US ones (70 and 71 % as opposed to 61 %). At
the same time, less negative judgments were made (37 and 48 % as against 53 %).
29.4.2.4
Summary
In both the US and German reader comments made on the mass media portals, statements
predominate that are still currently focused on the expected features of autonomous
driving. That is to say, the acceptance object is in fact the physical object—the car—and
its individual use. This takes a different form on Heise online, where discussions already
range far beyond familiarization with purely “technical” issues. Instead, they debate
concrete user scenarios and see autonomous driving more strongly in the context of the
overall socio-technological system of (auto)mobility. Most of those posting on the Heise
portal clearly possess greater knowledge of the technology than “normal” media con-
sumers. Public debate on autonomous driving has only just begun to pick up speed in the
last two to three years. We may therefore assume that, as it progresses, topics covering not
only the technology, but also its embedding in the system, will become of greater
relevance.
Overall, our study spans the “scope of acceptance” for autonomous driving as it
currently stands. This scope results from the topics setting the public agenda via the media
at present; these topics are also linked to speciﬁc judgments. When considering the range
of topics, it is apparent that some negative features accompany the mostly positive ones
attributed to autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, a series of questions have been thrown up
which still need clarifying from commenters’ point of view. Depending on how they are
answered, this will, in turn, have an impact on acceptance. The ambivalence that ﬁnds
expression here is ampliﬁed when objective/object-related statements are supplemented by
affective/subjective ones. Although autonomous vehicles as such are mainly adjudged
positively, there are also responses to autonomous driving and the roll-out of autonomous
vehicles in the transport system that range from distinct mistrust and clear skepticism to
downright refusal. This attitude is especially often associated with fear of negative social
consequences, and also loss of freedom.
Such an ambivalent stance vis-à-vis autonomous driving is, however, typical for atti-
tudes to technology—and is mirrored in the ﬁndings of other technology-acceptance
studies (in Germany) [14]. On the one hand, many beneﬁts are associated with autono-
mous driving that may make life more comfortable and open up new possibilities. On the
other, the expected changes are accompanied by fears of negative social consequences.
These manifest themselves in “loss of control of one’s own environment and one’s own
29
Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving
635
life” ([14]: 33, translation by the authors). At the bottom of this ambivalent response lies
the desire “to bring one’s personal environment and technology together in harmony and
to preserve the social, economic and natural environment for future generations” ([14]:
33, translation by the authors). As our analysis has shown, the debate on autonomous
driving not only revolves around making motorized personal transport safer, more com-
fortable, more ﬂexible, more efﬁcient, etc., but also highlights and reﬂects on the societal,
social and economic effects that it will usher in.
29.5
Outlook
Acceptance research, we have argued, must go beyond solely researching opinions and
attitudes. It should rather, in terms of an anticipatory societal market research (cf. [12]: 3),
identify requirements, ideas, desires, hopes, fears and anxieties, and classify these in the
context of a socio-technical system—in this case the transport system as part of the overall
social system—and its development. In this way, potential can be brought in line with
concrete options (see [41]). A complex topic like autonomous driving touches on various
aspects of our society, which is why interdisciplinary cooperation—such as the “Villa
Ladenburg” project of the Daimler and Benz Foundation, which initiated and brought
together the articles in the present volume—is indispensable.
Future studies on the acceptance of autonomous driving should place greater focus on
both cultural-, type-, and milieu-speciﬁc differences in acceptance, and interdependencies
between different aspects of the topic. The assessment of online comments has provided
important initial insights here, and shows the way for future surveys. The ambivalent
results concerning motivations for car usage must be given greater consideration. This will
make it possible to categorize the individual and social signiﬁcance of the way cars are
used and owned; the symbolic, emotional, and instrumental features ascribed to autono-
mous vehicles; and the inﬂuence current car use and ownership patterns can be expected
to have on the autonomous vehicles’ acceptance. Chap. 31 focuses on these questions.
In public discourse at least, it is currently not at all clear what is actually meant when
autonomous driving is under discussion—this is true of how the media both perceives and
presents the technology. Are autonomous (private) vehicles being discussed where the
driver can take the controls now and then? Or is it about driverless taxis that, “on
command” as it were, can transport both people and goods anywhere, anytime? It can
currently be assumed, as our analysis has also demonstrated, that many questions
accompanying a potential future roll-out of autonomous vehicles in our transport system
still need answering. This in turn means, however, that there is no clear answer to the
question of the use of autonomous driving, on both individual and societal levels. At
present, it can only be imagined which assigned values will assume the most important
roles in autonomous driving. We have, though, been able to at least give an insight into
the relevant topics associated with the technology: safety, comfort, cost savings, envi-
ronmental impacts, time savings, equal opportunities etc.
636
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
Furthermore, the context of acceptance and autonomous driving described above is of
central signiﬁcance for future studies. This conclusion can also be taken from the results,
among others, of US comments, with their marked socio-politically connoted statements.
These show that, to the commenters, autonomous driving looks like it may collide with
the prevailing system of norms and values of car usage. Future studies should therefore
investigate the individual and societal signiﬁcance of how cars are used today, and then
enquire precisely into how this is embedded in the context of daily praxis and cultural- and
milieu-speciﬁc frameworks (on this, see also Chap. 31). This will help to deﬁne which
speciﬁc issues can be expected to have an effect on the acceptance of autonomous driving.
In terms of deﬁning uses and assigning values more precisely, in future it will also be a
question of allowing potential users and other persons affected to experience the tech-
nology. This will give them an idea about what to expect from it, but also let them know
what it cannot do. To this effect, policy and public bodies especially could help in
promoting acceptance, or at least access ([4]: 3), by shaping public debate more vigor-
ously or initiating speciﬁc autonomous driving test and pilot projects: For the current
efforts and endeavours being made on the policy side, see Chap. 8. In other areas of the
project, it is already clear that speciﬁc use cases, as outlined in Chap. 2, each bring with
them speciﬁc judgments, expectations, and assessments (see Chap. 31 on car usage and
ownership in the context of autonomous driving and Chapters by 6, 12 and 32).

Societal Risk Constellations
for Autonomous Driving. Analysis,
Historical Context and Assessment
Armin Grunwald
30.1
Introduction and Overview
Technological advancement is changing societal risk constellations. In many cases the
result is signiﬁcantly improved safety and accordingly positive results such as good health,
longer life expectancies and greater prosperity. However, the novelty of technological
innovations also frequently brings with it unintended and unforeseen consequences,
including new risk types. The objective of technology assessment is not only to identify the
potential of the innovation but also to examine potential risks at the earliest possible stage
and thus contribute to a reasoned evaluation and sound decision-making [10].
In many respects, autonomous driving represents an attractive innovation for the future
of mobility. Greater safety and convenience, use of the time otherwise required for driving
for other purposes and efﬁciency gains on the system level are a few of the most com-
monly expected advantages [5]. At the same time, the systems and technologies for
autonomous driving—like any technology—are susceptible to errors that can lead to
accidents resulting in property damage or personal injuries. The central role of software
can lead to systemic risks, as is well known from the internet and computer worlds.
Economic risks—for example for the automotive industry—must also be considered, as
well as social risks, such as privacy concerns. Early, comprehensive analysis and eval-
uation of the possible risks of autonomous driving are an indispensable part of a
responsible research and innovation process and thus equally important preconditions for
acceptance both on the individual and societal levels. Against this backdrop, this chapter
will provide answers to the following questions as they apply speciﬁcally to technology
assessment:

– What speciﬁc societal risk constellations are posed by autonomous driving? Who
could be affected by which damages/injuries and with what probability?
– What can be learned from previous experience with risk debates on technological
advancement for the development and use of autonomous driving?
– How can the societal risk for the manufacture and operation of autonomous vehicles be
intelligibly assessed and organized in a responsible way?
The answers to these questions are intended to draw attention to potentially prob-
lematic developments in order to take any such issues into account in design decisions and
regulations and thus contribute to responsible and transparent organization of the societal
risk.
30.2
Risk Analysis and Ethics
We deﬁne risks as possible harm that can occur as the result of human action and
decisions. Many times we are willing to accept some risk, for example because we regard
the damage as very unlikely to occur or because we expect a beneﬁt from the decision that
outweighs the possible damage that could occur. In some cases, however, we are sub-
jected to risks by the decisions of others, for example through the driving behavior of
other drivers or political or regulatory decisions concerning business policy.
30.2.1 Risk-Terminology Dimensions
Risks contain three central semantic elements: the moment of uncertainty, because the
occurrence of possible damage is not certain; the moment of the undesired, because
damage is never welcome; and the social moment, because both opportunities and risks
are always distributed and are always opportunities and risks for particular individuals or
groups.
The moment of uncertainty gets to the epistemological aspect of risk: What do we
know about possible harms resulting from our actions and how reliable is this knowledge?
This question comprises two subquestions: (1) What type and how severe is the harm that
could occur as a result of the action and decision and (2) how plausible and probable is it
that the harm will actually occur? For both questions, the spectrum of possible answers
ranges from scientiﬁcally attested and statistically evaluable to mere assumptions and
speculations. If the provability of occurrence and expected scale of the damage can be
speciﬁed quantitatively, their product is frequently described as an ‘objective risk’ and
used in the insurance industry, for example. Otherwise one speaks of ‘subjectively’
estimated risks, for example based on the perception of risk among certain groups of
people. Between these poles there is a broad spectrum with many shades of gray with
regard to plausibility considerations.
642
A. Grunwald
The moment of the undesired is, at least in the societal realm, semantically inseparable
from the concept of risk: As representing possible harm, risks are undesirable in them-
selves.1 Nevertheless, the evaluation of the possible consequences of actions as a risk or
opportunity may be disputed [2]. One example is whether genetic modiﬁcation of plants is
perceived as a means of securing world nutrition or as a risk for humanity and the
environment. The assessment depends on the expected or assumed degree of affectedness
by the consequences, which in combination with the uncertainty of those consequences
leaves some room for interpretation—and thus all but invites controversy.
Finally, risks also have a social dimension: They are always a risk for someone. Many
times, opportunities and risks are distributed differently among different groups of people.
In extreme cases, the beneﬁciaries are not affected by possible harms at all, while those
who bear the risks have no part in the expected beneﬁts. So in deliberations regarding
opportunities and risks, it is not sufﬁcient to simply apply some abstract method such as a
cost-beneﬁt analysis on the macroeconomic level; rather, it is crucial also to consider who
is affected by the opportunities and risks in which ways and whether the distribution is fair
(Chap. 27).
We accept risks as the unintended consequences of actions and decisions or we impose
them on others [15], or expose objects to them (such as the natural elements). When we
speak of a societal risk constellation, we are referring to the relationship between groups
of people such as decision-makers, regulators, stakeholders, affected parties, advisors,
politicians and beneﬁciaries in view of the frequently controversial diagnoses of expected
beneﬁts and feared risks. Describing the societal risk constellations for autonomous
driving is the primary objective of this chapter. It is crucial to distinguish between active
and passive confrontation with the risks of autonomous driving:
1. Active: People assume risks in their actions; they accept them individually or collec-
tively, consciously or unconsciously. Those who decide and act frequently risk
something for themselves. A car company that views autonomous driving as a future
ﬁeld of business and invests massively in it risks losing its investment. The harm
would primarily be borne by the company itself (shareholders, employees).
2. Passive: People are subjected to risks by the decisions of other people. Those affected
are different than those who make the decisions. A risky driver risks not only his or her
own health but also the lives and health of others.
Between these extremes, the following risk levels can be distinguished analytically:
(1) Risks that the individual can decide to take or not, such as riding a motorcycle,
extreme sports or, in the future, perhaps a space voyage; (2) imposed risks that the
individual can reasonably easily avoid, such as potential health risks due to food additives
that can, given appropriate labeling, be avoided by purchasing other foods; (3) imposed
1In other areas, that is not always the case. For example, in some leadership positions a willingness
to take risks is regarded as a strength, and in leisure activities such as computer games or sports,
people often consciously seek risk.
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
643
risks that can only be avoided with considerable effort, e.g. in cases such as the decision
of where to locate a waste incineration site, radioactive waste storage site or chemical
factories—it is theoretically possible to move to another location, but only at great cost;
and (4) imposed risks that cannot be avoided such as the hole in the ozone layer, gradual
pollution of groundwater, soil degradation, accumulation of harmful substances in the
food chain, noise, airborne particles, etc.
The central risk-related ethical question is under which conditions assuming risks (in
the active case) or imposing them on others (in the passive case) can be justiﬁed [11]. In
many cases there is a difference between the actual acceptance of risks and the norma-
tively expected acceptance, i.e. the acceptability of the risks [8, 9]. While acceptance rests
with the individual, acceptability raises a host of ethical questions: Why and under what
conditions can one legitimately impose risks on other people (Chap. 4)? The question
gains yet more urgency when the potentially affected are neither informed of the risks nor
have the chance to give their consent, e.g. in the case of risks for future generations. The
objective of the ethics of risk [11] is a normative evaluation of the acceptability and
justiﬁability of risks in light of the empirical knowledge about the type and severity of the
harm, the probability of its occurrence and resilience (capacity for resistance) and in
relation to a speciﬁc risk constellation.2
30.2.2 Constellation Analysis for Risks
Conventional questions as to the type and severity of the risk associated with particular
measures or new technologies are therefore too general and obscure salient differentia-
tions. An adequate and careful discussion of risks must be conducted in a context-based
and differentiated manner and should, as far as possible, answer the following questions
with regard to autonomous driving:
– For whom can damages occur; which groups of people may be affected or suffer
disadvantages?
– How are the possible risks distributed among different groups of people? Are those
who bear the risks different groups than those which would beneﬁt from autonomous
driving?
– Who are the respective decision-makers? Do they decide on risks they would take
themselves or do they impose risks on others?
– What types of harm are imaginable (health/life of people, property damage, effects on
jobs, corporate reputations, etc.)?
– What is the plausibility or probability that the risks will occur? What does their
occurrence depend on?
2The results of Fraedrich/Lenz [6, S. 50] show that potential beneﬁciaries consider not only
individual but also societal risks.
644
A. Grunwald
– How great is the potential scope of the risks of autonomous driving in terms of
geographic reach and duration? Are there indirect risks, e.g. of systemic effects?
– Which actors are involved in risk analysis, risk communication and the evaluation of
risks, and what perspectives do they bring to the table?
– What do we know about these constellations; with what degree of reliability do we
know it; what uncertainties are involved; and which of those may not be possible to
eliminate?
In this way, ‘the’ abstract risk can be broken down into a number of clearly deﬁnable
risks in precise constellations whose legitimation and justiﬁability can then be discussed
individually in concrete terms. The societal risks of autonomous driving are made
transparent—one could say that a ‘map’ of the risks emerges, representing an initial step
towards understanding the overall risk situation in this ﬁeld. Different constellations
involve different legitimation expectations and different ethical issues, e.g. in terms of
rights to information and co-determination [11, 15], but also different measures in the
societal handling of these risks.
30.3
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving
Societal risk constellations for autonomous driving comprise various aspects of possible
harms and disadvantages, different social dimensions and varying degrees of plausibility
of the occurrence of possible harms.
30.3.1 Accident Risk Constellation
One of the expected advantages of autonomous driving is a major reduction in the number
of trafﬁc accidents and thus less harm to life, health and valuables [5] (Chap. 17). This
reduction is a major ethical matter [3]. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that due to
technological defects or in situations for which the technology is not prepared, accidents
may occur which are speciﬁc to autonomous driving and which would be unlikely to
occur with a human driver. One example of this could be unforeseen situations which are
unmanageable for the automation in a parking assistant (Chap. 2). Even if only minor
dents were the result here, it would have clear legal and ﬁnancial repercussions that would
have to be addressed. These would be all the more complex the greater the accident
damage, e.g. in the case of a severe accident with a highway auto-pilot (Chap. 2).
We are very familiar with auto accidents after more than 100 years of established
automotive trafﬁc. They involve one or a few vehicles, result in damage for a limited
number of people and have limited ﬁnancial effects. For this risk type of small-scale
accidents, an extensive and reﬁned system of emergency services, trauma medicine, lia-
bility law and insurance is in place. Individual accidents caused by autonomous vehicles
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
645
can in large part presumably be handled within the existing system. However, the nec-
essary further development of the legal framework is no trivial matter (see [7]).
Accident risks of this type affect the users of autonomous vehicles as passengers. Users
decide for themselves whether they wish to subject themselves to the risk by either using
or not using an autonomous vehicle. But the accident risks of autonomous driving can also
affect other road users, including, naturally, those who do not participate in autonomous
driving. One can theoretically avoid these risks by not taking part in road trafﬁc—but that
would be associated with signiﬁcant limitations. Thus dealing with the risks of autono-
mous driving is a complex question of negotiation and regulation (Chaps. 4 and 25), in
which not only the market, i.e. buying behavior, is decisive, but in which questions of the
common welfare such as the potential endangerment of others and their protection must
also be considered. This will require democratic and legally established procedures
(registration procedures, authorities, checks, trafﬁc regulations, product liability, etc.).
These risks and also their complex distribution are not new; indeed they are omni-
present in the practice of everyday trafﬁc and also societally accepted. This is manifest in
the fact that the currently more than 3000 annual trafﬁc deaths in Germany, for example,
do not lead to protests, rejection of car transportation or massive pressure for change. The
latter component was different in the 1970s, when in West Germany alone over 20,000
annual trafﬁc deaths were recorded despite trafﬁc volumes roughly a tenth of what they are
today. Measures primarily aimed at improving passive safety were enacted, leading to a
signiﬁcant reduction in the death rates. Decisive for any societal risk comparison of the
previous system with a future system including autonomous driving will be a substantial
reduction in the total number of trafﬁc accidents and the damage caused by them
(Chaps. 17 and 21). The fact that autonomous driving will not suddenly replace the
current system but will presumably be gradually integrated into the trafﬁc system is,
against this backdrop, a mixed blessing. On the one hand, mixed systems with human
drivers and autonomously guided vehicles will presumably be of signiﬁcantly greater
complexity and unpredictability than a system completely switched-over to autonomous
driving. On the other hand, gradual introduction into the transportation system will pro-
vide the chance to learn from damage incidents and make improvements. The monitoring
of damage incidents and cause analysis will be of critical importance here (Chap. 21).
If the expectation is borne out that human-caused accidents drop substantially with the
introduction of autonomous driving, liability law will gain additional signiﬁcance as the
share (albeit not necessarily the absolute number) of technology-caused accidents rises.3
While today in most cases the cause of accidents is a human driver and therefore the
liability insurance providers pay for damages, in accidents caused by an autonomous
vehicle, the operator liability of the vehicle owner or the manufacturer’s product liability
would apply (Chap. 26; see also [4, 7]).
3This would, incidentally, also affect a major line of business in the insurance industry, third-party
liability insurance.

30.3.2 Transportation System Risk Constellation
On the system level, autonomous driving promises greater efﬁciency, reduced congestion
and (albeit presumably only marginally; see [5, 13]) better environmental performance
(Chap. 16). In the traditional transportation system, systemic effects and thus also potential
risks arise primarily due to the available trafﬁc infrastructure and its bottlenecks in con-
junction with individual driver behavior and trafﬁc volume. Individual situations such as
severe accidents or construction zones can lead to systemic effects like trafﬁc jams.
Autonomous driving adds another possible cause of systemic effects to the existing ones:
the underlying technology. The following will consider only autonomous vehicles relying
on an internet connection (not on-board autonomous).
Through the control software and the reliance on the internet (e.g. as part of the
“internet of things”), new effects could emerge (Chap. 24). While in the automotive world
to date vehicles are operated more or less independently of one another and mass phe-
nomena only occur through the unplanned interactions of the individually guided vehicles,
autonomously guided trafﬁc will to some extent be connected through control centers and
networking, e.g. to direct trafﬁc optimally using interconnected auto-pilots (Chap. 2). The
control of a large number of vehicles will in all likelihood be conducted through software
that is identical in its fundamental structure, as the complexity and concentration of
companies will presumably strongly limit the number of providers. This could, in theory,
lead to the simultaneous breakdown or malfunctioning of a large number of vehicles based
on the same software problem. These problems would then no longer necessarily be on a
manageable scale in terms of geography, duration and scale of the damage as in the
aforementioned accident cases, but could take on economically signiﬁcant proportions.
Insofar as autonomous vehicles are connected to each other in a network via internet or
some other technology, the system of autonomous driving can be regarded as a coordi-
nated mega-system. Its complexity would be extremely high, not least because it would
also have to integrate human-guided trafﬁc—the pattern constellation for systemic risks
which are difﬁcult or even impossible to foresee in which the risks of complex technology
and software could combine with unanticipated human actions to create unexpected
system problems [15].
A completely different type of system problem, in this case only for non-on-board
autonomous systems but rather for networked vehicles, could be a sort of concealed
centralization and an associated concentration of power. Since optimization on the system
level can only be done through extra-regional control centers (Chap. 24), a certain degree
of centralization—all decentralization on the user side notwithstanding—on the control
and management level is indispensable. This could give rise to concerns that the neces-
sities engendered by the technology could lead to problematic societal consequences: a
centrally controlled trafﬁc system as the precursor to a centralist society whose lifeblood
was a ‘mega-infrastructure’ beyond the control of the democratic order. But this is not a
foreseeable societal risk of autonomous driving and is not by any means a necessary
development in this regard. Rather, this is more a concern of the type that should be borne
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
647
in mind as a potentially problematic issue during the establishment of autonomous driving
so that, in the event of its emergence, countermeasures can be taken.
In all of these ﬁelds, the decision-makers are a complex web of automotive companies,
software producers, political regulators and agencies with different responsibilities. It is
possible the new actors may also become involved whose roles cannot be foreseen today.
Decision-makers and those affected are largely distinct groups. And since road users and
other citizens would have practically no means of avoiding such risks, it is essential that
an open, society-wide debate on these matters take place in order to observe and assess the
development with due care and bring in any political or regulatory measures that may be
appropriate.
30.3.3 Investment Risk Constellation
Research and development of the technologies of autonomous driving are extremely
elaborate and accordingly cost-intensive. Suppliers and automotive companies are already
investing now, and considerable additional investments would be required before any
introduction of autonomous driving. As with other investments, the business risk exists
that the return on investment may not be on the expected scale or in the expected
timeframe due to autonomous driving failing to catch on a large scale for whatever reason.
If a company opts not to invest in the technology, by contrast, there is the risk that
competitors will pursue autonomous driving and, if it succeeds, vastly increase their
market share. Thus strategic business decisions have to be made in consideration of the
different risks.
Upon ﬁrst consideration this is a standard case of business management and a classic
task for the management of a company. In view of the scale of the needed investments and
the patience required for the development of autonomous driving, decisions made in this
regard will have very long-term implications. Missteps would initially affect shareholders
and employees of the respective companies, and if major crises were triggered by such
failures the consequences could extend to the economy as a whole, for example in
Germany with its heavy reliance on automotive companies. Although in principle a
competitive situation, the scale of the economic challenge may speak in favor of forming
strategic coalitions to design a joint standard base technology.
Even after a successful market launch, mishaps or even technology-related system
effects (see above) can occur which could pose a major risk for the affected brands
(Chaps. 21 and 28). One issue that merits special mention in this context is the risk factor
posed by the complexity of the software required for autonomous driving. Complex
software is impossible to test in its entirety, which means that in actual use unexpected
problems can occur (see Chap. 21 on the testability and back-up of the system). In this
sense, use is essentially another test phase, and the users are testers. This is already the
case to some degree in the automotive world, with software problems a relatively frequent
cause of breakdowns. Whether drivers will accept being used as ‘test subjects’ in a more
648
A. Grunwald
expansive sense remains to be seen. Any such willingness would presumably be all but
nonexistent in safety-related cases. When a computer crashes due to a software error, it is
annoying. When an autonomous vehicle causes an accident due to a software error, it is
unacceptable. In such cases—unlike with “normal” accidents—massive media attention
could be expected.
In particular due to the power of images and their dissemination through the media,
such incidents can still have a major impact even when the issues are easily correctable
and the consequences minor. A good example of this is the notoriety of the “moose test”,
which came to public attention through publication of an incident on a test course.
Another example is the story of the sustained damage to the reputation of Audi on the
American market that resulted from a report in the US media in 1986 (Chap. 28). Irre-
spective of the severity of the mishap, such incidents threaten to damage the company’s
reputation and thus pose economic risks. Such risks are also present in the case of major
recall actions, in which the substantial economic burden posed by the action itself is
generally outweighed by the damage to the company’s reputation. The probability of such
developments rises with the complexity of the required software, which thus emerges as a
central aspect of the risks associated with autonomous driving.
30.3.4 Labor Market Risk Constellation
Technological and socio-technological transformation processes typically have labor
market implications. Automation, in particular, is associated with concerns about the loss
of jobs. The automation in production and manufacturing in the 1980s led to the loss of
millions of jobs in Germany alone, primarily in the sectors dominated by simple manual
tasks. A massive societal effort was required to prepare at least a portion of those affected
by the job losses for new jobs through qualiﬁcation and training. Today there are concerns
that the next wave of automation could make even more sophisticated activities super-
ﬂuous. On the upside, moves towards greater automation can lead to the emergence of
new ﬁelds of activity and job opportunities, so the overall balance need not be negative.
But these new ﬁelds of activity are generally only open to people with higher
qualiﬁcations.
Comprehensive introduction of autonomous driving would undoubtedly affect the
labor market. The primary losers would be drivers of vehicles which are currently man-
ually operated: truck drivers, taxi drivers, employees of logistics and delivery companies,
especially in the Vehicle-on-Demand’ use case (Chap. 2). A mobility system completely
converted to autonomous driving could in fact largely do without these jobs altogether. On
the other side of the equation, new jobs in the control and monitoring of autonomous
trafﬁc could emerge, and highly qualiﬁed personnel would be needed in the development,
testing and manufacture of the systems, particularly in the supplier industry.
Thus a similar scenario to the one described above for the previous waves of
automation would emerge here as well: elimination of unskilled jobs and the creation of
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
649
new, highly skilled positions. The net outcome in jobs is impossible to predict from this
vantage point. What is clear is that the high number of potentially affected jobs makes it
imperative to think about pro-active measures to deal with the development at an early
stage, e.g. developing and providing qualiﬁcation measures. As it may be presumed that
the integration of autonomous driving into the current transportation system will occur
gradually, and because there is a wealth of experience from previous automation pro-
cesses, the prerequisites for an effective response should be in place. To identify devel-
opments that could be problematic for the labor market at an early stage, research and
cooperation on the part of unions, employers and the employment agency to observe
current develops is required.
30.3.5 Accessibility Risk Constellation
Autonomous driving promises greater accessibility for people with reduced mobility, such
as the elderly. While this is clearly on the plus side from an ethical standpoint, it could
also have social justice implications which, as ‘possible harms,’ could be regarded as
risks. This includes primarily the occasionally voiced concern regarding increased costs of
individual mobility due to the costs of autonomous driving. In a mixed system this
concern could be countered with the argument that the traditional alternative of driving
oneself still exists and thus that no change for the worse would occur.
This scenario would beg the question, however, of who would actually proﬁt from the
beneﬁts—primarily safety and convenience—of autonomous driving. If the sole effect of
autonomous driving were simply to enable those who currently have the means to employ
a chauffeur to dispense with their chauffeurs and even save money in the process in spite
of the higher up-front and operating costs, this would certainly not promote greater
accessibility to mobility in general. Indeed, it would be detrimental if a large share of
those who currently drive themselves were unable to afford to participate in autonomous
driving. When considering such problematic developments, it must be noted, ﬁrst, that
questions of distributive justice are not speciﬁc to autonomous driving; the just distri-
bution of the beneﬁts of new technologies is a fundamental question with regard to
technological advancement. Second, these concerns remain speculative at present as no
reliable cost information is available.
Social justice issues could arise in relation to the costs of any infrastructure to be
established for autonomous driving [5, p. 12] [13]. If it were regarded, for example, as a
public responsibility and were funded through tax moneys, non-users would also take part
in ﬁnancing autonomous driving. If the costs were borne by all drivers, non-users would
also regard themselves as subsidizing autonomous driving. Depending on how high the
infrastructure costs and thus the costs for individuals were, this could also give rise to
social justice questions relating to the distribution of the costs.
650

30.3.6 Privacy Risk Constellations
Even today modern automobiles provide a wealth of data and leave electronic trails, e.g.
by using a navigation aid or through data transmitted to the manufacturer. If autonomous
vehicles were not on-board autonomous but had to be connected at all times, the electronic
trail would amount to a complete movement proﬁle [13]. Of course the movement proﬁles
of vehicles do not necessarily have to be identical to the movement proﬁles of their users.
In the case of vehicles on demand (Chap. 2) it is of course possible to imagine that they
could be used anonymously if ordering and payment were conducted anonymously—
which, however, seems rather inconsistent with the current development toward electronic
booking and payment systems.
Movement proﬁles provide valuable information for intelligence services, which could
for instance track the movements of regime opponents, but also for companies, which
could use such information to create proﬁles for targeted advertising. In view of the
increasing digitalization and connectedness of more and more areas of our social and
personal lives, the speciﬁc additional digitalization in the ﬁeld of autonomous driving
would presumably represent just one element among many others. The problem—even
today the end of privacy is declared with regularity—is immensely larger, as current
debates about the NSA, industry 4.0 and Big Data show. The emergence of a converging
mega-structure comprising the transportation system, supply of information, communi-
cation systems, energy systems and possibly other, currently independently functioning
infrastructures, represents one of the biggest challenges of the coming years or even
decades. The issue will be to re-deﬁne the boundaries between privacy and the public
sphere and then actually implement those decisions. This must be done on the political
level and is of fundamental signiﬁcance for democracy as a concept, for absolute trans-
parency is but the ﬂip-side of a totalitarian system. Autonomous driving is presumably of
only minor speciﬁc signiﬁcance in this debate.
30.3.7 Dependency Risk Constellation
Modern societies are increasingly dependent on the smooth functioning of technology.
This begins with the dependency on personal computers and cars and extends to the
complete dependency on a functioning energy supply and worldwide data communication
networks and data processing capabilities as prerequisites for the global economy.
Infrastructures that are becoming more complex, such as the electricity supply, which
increasingly has to deal with a ﬂuctuating supply due to renewable energy sources, now
more frequently engender ‘systemic risks’ [15] in which small causes can lead to system
instability through complex chain reactions and positive feedback. This increasingly
frequently discussed susceptibility to technical failure and random events, but also ter-
rorist attacks on the technological infrastructure of society (e.g. in the form of a
cyber-terror attack on the information technology backbone of the globalized economy)
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
651
represents an unintended and undesirable, yet ultimately unavoidable consequence of
accelerated technological advancement [10]. At issue are risks that emerge more or less
gradually, which in many cases are not consciously accepted in the context of an explicit
consideration of risk versus opportunity but instead only come to public attention when
the dependency becomes tangible, such as during a lengthy blackout, which would
incapacitate practically every venue of public life [12].
In the case of a large-scale shift of mobility capacity to autonomous driving, a high
proportion of society’s mobility needs would naturally depend on the functioning of this
system. A breakdown would be manageable as long as there were enough people who
could still operate the vehicles manually. In a system that allowed passenger vehicle trafﬁc
to switch from autonomous to manual, for example, this would be no problem. But if a
large share of the logistics and freight trafﬁc were switched over to autonomous systems, it
would be implausible, in the case of a longer-term total breakdown of the system, to
maintain a sufﬁcient pool of drivers, not to mention the fact that the vehicles would have
to be equipped to enable manual operation in the ﬁrst place. Even if signiﬁcant logistics
chains were to be interrupted for a lengthy period due to a system failure, bottlenecks
could still quickly form, both in terms of supplying the population and maintaining
production in the manufacturing industries [12]. This type of risk is nothing new: the
massive dependence on a reliable energy supply that has been the object of much dis-
cussion since Germany’s energy transformation policy came into effect, as well as the
dependence of the global economy on the internet, are structurally very similar.
Another form of dependence can arise from autonomous driving on the individual level
through the atrophying of skills. Large-scale use of autonomous vehicles would result in
the loss of driving practice. If the vehicles are then operated manually, e.g. on weekends
or on vacation, the reduced driving practice—a certain dependence on autonomously
guided vehicles—could result in lower skill levels, such as the ability to master unex-
pected situations. In the case of a total breakdown of the system, there would suddenly be
large numbers of manually operated vehicles on the roads, in which case the reduced skill
of the drivers could once again prove problematic. Moreover, there would presumably be
major bottlenecks and trafﬁc jams if the expected efﬁciency gains on the system level (see
above) were suddenly to disappear.
Finally, the further digitalization and transfer of autonomy to technical systems would
increase society’s vulnerability to intentional disruptions and external attacks. Autono-
mous driving could be affected by terrorists, psychopaths or indeed military scenarios
(cyber warfare). Control centers could be hacked, malware installed, or even a system
collapse triggered through malicious action. Defensive measures are of course necessary
and technically feasible; but here we run into the notorious ‘tortoise and hare’ problem.
But here again, this is not a problem speciﬁc to autonomous driving; it is known in the
internet world and has arrived in the energy sector, for example, as well.

30.3.8 On the Relationship Between Risk Constellation
and Introduction Scenario
The risk constellations described here are based on qualitative and exploratory consid-
erations from the current world of mobility. They therefore have a certain plausibility, but
also contain speculative aspects. They should not be understood as predictions, but as
guideposts that should be observed along the way to the research, development and
introduction of autonomous driving. Indeed, they cannot be predictive because any future
occurrence of particular risk constellations depends on the introduction scenario for
autonomous driving and its speciﬁc characteristics, and both of these elements are
unknown today. For example, the contours of the ‘privacy’ risk constellation will depend
heavily on whether an on-board autonomous driving scenario is implemented or auton-
omous vehicles continuously need to be connected to the internet and control centers.
The public perception of the risk will depend largely on how autonomous driving is
introduced. If it happens as part of a gradual automation of driving, the potential to learn
gradually from the experiences gained along the way will greatly lessen the risk of a
‘scandalization’ of autonomous driving as a high-risk technology for passengers and
bystanders. Steps on the way to further automation such as Trafﬁc Jam Assist, Automated
Valet Parking or Automated Highway Cruising (Chap. 2), the introduction of which seems
likely in the coming years (Chap. 10), would presumably not lead to an increased per-
ception of risk because they would seem a natural development along the incremental path
of technological advancement.
Unlike switching on a nuclear reactor, for example, the process of increasing driver
assistance towards greater automation has so far progressed gradually. The automatic
transmission has been around for some decades, we are comfortable with ABS, ESP and
parking assistants, and further steps towards a greater degree of driver assistance are in the
works. Incremental introduction allows for a maximum degree of learning and would also
enable gradual adaptation of the labor market, for example, or privacy concerns (see
above).
In more revolutionary introduction scenarios (Chap. 10) other and likely more vexing
challenges would present themselves for the prospective analysis and perception of risks.
The public perception would then react especially sensitively to accidents or critical
situations, the risk of ‘scandalization’ would be greater and the ‘investment’ risk con-
stellation (see above) could develop into a real problem for individual suppliers or brands.
30.4
Relationship to Previous Risk Debates
Germany and other industrialized countries have extensive experience with acceptance
and risk debates over many decades. This section will seek to draw insights from these
previous risk communications and apply them to autonomous driving—insofar as this is
possible in light of the very different risk constellations.
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
653
30.4.1 Experience from the Major Risk Debates
30.4.1.1
Nuclear Power
The risk constellations for nuclear energy arose principally from the fact that one side was
comprised of the decision-makers from politics and the business community, supported by
experts from the associated natural science and engineering disciplines. On the other side
were the affected parties, including in particular residents in the vicinity of the nuclear
power plants, the reprocessing plant and the planned nuclear waste repository in Gorleben,
but also growing numbers of the German populace.
Nuclear power is a typical technology that is far-removed form everyday experience.
Although many people proﬁt from the generated energy, the source of the energy is not
visible, as evidenced by the old saying that “electricity comes from the electrical socket.”
The possibility of a worst-case scenario with catastrophic damage potential like in
Chernobyl and Fukushima; the fact that on account of those incidents no insurance
company was or is willing to insure nuclear power plants; the extremely long-term danger
posed by radioactive waste; all of these factors demonstrate that the risk constellation in
the case of nuclear power is completely different than the one for autonomous driving.
Only one point was instructive:
The early nuclear power debate in Germany was characterized by the arrogance of the
experts, who at that time were almost entirely in favor of nuclear power, in the face of
criticism. Concerns among the public were not taken seriously, and critics were portrayed
as irrational, behind the times or ignorant [14]. In this way, trust was squandered in several
areas: Trust in the network of experts, politicians and business leaders behind nuclear
energy; trust in the democratic process; and trust in technical experts regarding com-
mercial technologies in general. The risk debate on nuclear energy illustrates the
importance of trust in institutions and people and how quickly it can be lost.
30.4.1.2
Green Biotechnology
The risk constellation in the debate over green biotechnology is interesting in a different
way. In spite of a rhetorical focus on risks, for example through the release and uncon-
trolled spread of modiﬁed organisms, the actual topic here is less the concrete scale of the
risk and more the distribution of risks and beneﬁts. Unlike with red biotechnology, the end
consumer in this case would have no apparent beneﬁt from genetically modiﬁed food. In
the best case, the genetically modiﬁed foods would not be worse than conventionally
produced foods. The beneﬁts would accrue primarily to the producing companies. In
terms of potential health risks (e.g. allergies), however, the converse would be the case:
they would affect users. That is naturally a bad trade-off for users: excluded from the
beneﬁts, but exposed to potential risks. This viewpoint could present a plausible expla-
nation for the lack of acceptance and offer a lesson for autonomous driving, i.e. not to
emphasize abstract beneﬁts (e.g. for the economy or the environment) but to focus on the
beneﬁts to the ‘end customer’.
654
A. Grunwald
A second insight also emerges. The attempt by agribusiness companies, and in par-
ticular Monsanto, to impose green biotechnology in Europe only intensiﬁed the mistrust
and opposition. In sensitive areas such as food, pressure and lobbying raise consumer
consciousness and lead to mistrust. Attempting to ‘push through’ new technologies in
ﬁelds that are close to everyday experience, which driving undoubtedly is, therefore seems
like an inherently risky strategy.
30.4.1.3
Mobile Communication Technologies
Mobile technologies (mobile phones, mobile internet) are an interesting case of a tech-
nology introduction that is successful in spite of public risk discussions. Although there
has been a lively risk discussion regarding electromagnetic radiation (EMF), this has had
no adverse affect on acceptance on the individual level. Only locations with transmission
towers are the focus of ongoing protests and opposition. There is practically no opposition
whatsoever to the technology in itself. The most obvious explanation is that the beneﬁt—
and not the beneﬁt to the economy, but the individual beneﬁt experienced by each user—
is simply too great.
Even the serious and publicly discussed risks to privacy that have come to light in
recent years due to spying by companies and intelligence services have had barely any
impact on consumer behavior. Mobile telephony, online banking, e-commerce and the
perpetually-online lifestyle enable the creation of eerily accurate proﬁles, and yet this does
not prevent users from continuing to use these technologies and continuously volunteer
private information in the process. It is plainly the immediate beneﬁt that moves us to
accept these risks even when we know and criticize them.
30.4.1.4
Nanotechnology
Ever since a risk debate about nanotechnology emerged some 15 years ago, the tech-
nology has been dogged by concerns that it could fall victim to a public perception
disaster similar to the ones experienced by nuclear energy or genetically modiﬁed crops.
The extremely wide-ranging, but entirely speculative concerns of the early days, which
took the form of horror scenarios such as the loss of human control over the technology,
have since disappeared from the debate without these effects coming into play. Through
open debate, nanotechnology emerged from the speculative extremes between rapturous
expectations and apocalyptic fears to become a ‘normal’ technology whose beneﬁts reside
primarily in new material characteristics achieved through the coating or incorporation of
nanoparticles.
Here again there were fears of large-scale rejection of the technology. Calls by orga-
nizations such as the ETC-Group and BUND for a strict interpretation of the precautionary
principle, for example in the form of a moratorium on the use of nanoparticles in con-
sumer products such as cosmetics or foods, gave voice to such concerns. Yet a funda-
mentalist hardening of the fronts did not occur despite the evident potential. One reason is
presumably that communication of the risk proceeded much differently in this case than
with nuclear technology and genetic engineering. While in those cases experts initially
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
655
failed to take concerns and misgivings seriously, dismissing them as irrational and con-
veying a message of “we have everything under control,” the risk discussion concerning
nanotechnology was and remains characterized by openness. Scientists and representa-
tives of the business community have not denied that further research is still needed with
regard to potential risks and that risks cannot be ruled out until the toxicology is more
advanced. This helped build trust. The situation could be described somewhat paradox-
ically as follows: Because all sides have openly discussed the need for further research and
potential risks, the debate has remained constructive. The gaps in the science regarding
potential risks has been construed as a need for research rather than cause for demanding
that products with nanomaterials be barred from the market. Rather than insisting on the
absolute avoidance of risks (zero risk), trust that any risks will be dealt with responsibly
has been fostered.
30.4.2 Conclusions for Autonomous Driving
Autonomous driving will be an everyday technology that is as closely connected to
people’s lives as driving is today. That distinguishes it greatly from nuclear energy, while
it shares this everyday-life quality with green biotechnology (through its use in food
production) and mobile communication technology. From both risk debates we may
extract the insight of how central the dimension of individual beneﬁt is. While any such
beneﬁt from eating genetically modiﬁed food has scarcely even been advanced by its
proponents, the individual beneﬁts of mobile telephones and mobile internet access are
readily evident. And as soon as this beneﬁt is demonstrably large, people are prepared to
assume possible risks. And this is absolutely rational from an action theory standpoint.
What is irrational is to assume risks when the beneﬁts are not evident or would only
accrue to other actors (e.g. Monsanto in the green biotechnology debate). In such cases a
risk debate can have dramatic consequences and obliterate any chance of acceptance.
Another such knock-out scenario is the possibility of a massive catastrophe such as the
‘residual risk’ of the meltdown of a nuclear power facility. This was decided on the
political level, albeit with little chance of external inﬂuence. The situation was thus widely
regarded as a passive risk situation in which people were exposed to potential harm by the
decisions of others. Nothing can be gleaned directly from this scenario for autonomous
driving as it would presumably be introduced in the familiar market context of conven-
tional transportation and thus de facto depend on the acceptance of users from the outset.
While it is possible to imagine other introduction scenarios (Chap. 10), state-mandated use
of autonomous driving is all but unthinkable. The only indirect lesson from the history of
nuclear energy is that expertocratic arrogance generates mistrust. An open discussion
‘between equals’—a lesson from the nanotechnology debate as well—is a key precon-
dition for a constructive debate on technology in an open society.
These examples also show that talk of a German aversion to technology is a myth born
of the experiences with nuclear energy and genetic engineering. All empirical studies
656
A. Grunwald
show that otherwise, acceptance is very high across a large spectrum of technology
(digital technologies, entertainment technology, new automotive technologies, new
materials, etc.) [1]. This also applies to some technologies for which intensive risk debates
have taken place in the past or are still ongoing (e.g. mobile telephones). The fact that
nowadays questions regarding risks are immediately posed does not indicate hostility to
technology; rather, it is a reﬂection of the experience of the ambivalent character of
technology and the desire to obtain as much information as possible. Much that is
commonly taken as evidence of hostility to technology has little to do with technology.
The Stuttgart21 protests were not about rejecting rail technology; protests against new
runways at major airports are not about rejecting aviation technology; nor are protests
against highways and bypasses about rejecting the technology of driving cars. Even the
rejection of genetically modiﬁed crops and nuclear energy have much to do with
non-technological factors: mistrust of multinational corporations like Monsanto and a lack
of conﬁdence in adequate control and monitoring (e.g. Tebco in Japan).
30.5
Strategies of Responsible Risk Management
Risk management must be adapted to the respective risk constellations and be conducted
on the appropriate levels (public debates, legal regulations, politically legitimated regu-
lation, business decisions, etc.). It is based on the description of the risk constellation,
in-depth risk analyses in the respective ﬁelds and a societal risk assessment.
30.5.1 Risk Evaluation
The societal risk assessment is a complex process involving a variety of actors that can
take on its own dynamics and lead to unforeseeable developments [15]. Starting with
statements by especially visible actors (in the case of new technologies, frequently sci-
entists and businesses on the one hand and pressure groups and environmental groups on
the other) leads to a gradual concentration of positions and point-counterpoint situations in
the mass media and the public debates represented by them. Individual incidents can tip
public opinion or dramatically accelerate developments, as seen in the rapid shift of
attitudes about nuclear energy following the reactor incidents in Chernobyl and
Fukushima. That makes predictions extremely difﬁcult. The following will venture a
tentative statement on autonomous driving in consideration of the plausibility and the
lessons drawn from the previous debates.
To begin with, it is important to note that comparisons are very important for risk
assessments [8, 13, 15]. We evaluate new forms of risk by looking at them in relation to
known forms of risk. Here we have a known risk constellation shared by autonomous
driving and conventional driving that can and should be applied as a key benchmark for
comparison (Chap. 28; see also Sect. 30.3 in this paper). If autonomous driving were to
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
657
score signiﬁcantly and unambiguously better in this comparison (i.e. greater safety, lower
risk of accidents), this would be a very important factor in the societal risk assessment.
Moreover, the risks of autonomous driving appear to be relatively minor in many
respects. Technology-related accidents would occur with a certain probability, which
could be minimized, but not eliminated, in an intensive test phase. Unlike in the case of
nuclear energy, for example, their consequences would be relatively minor in geographic
and temporal terms (compare the half-lives of radioactive materials) as well as with
respect to the number of involved people and the property damage. A worst-case scenario
of catastrophic proportions does not apply.
Largely new is the digital networking potentially associated with the automation of
driving, with all of its implications for possible systemic risks, vulnerabilities, privacy and
surveillance. These will inevitably be major issues in any public debate on autonomous
driving. But as these challenges are also present in a multitude of other ﬁelds (including,
increasingly, non-autonomous driving), they would be unlikely to lead to risk concerns
relating speciﬁcally to autonomous driving.
One special case is the business risk assessment by manufacturers (Sect. 3.3), both in
terms of the return on investment and potential reputation problems due to accidents. Any
such business assessment must work with extremely uncertain assumptions, for instance
concerning the media’s willingness to play up scandals as well as the effect of any such
scandals in themselves. Here misperceptions can arise in both directions: exaggerated
fears and naive optimism. It is to be expected, in any event, that from the public per-
spective, scandals would be speciﬁcally attributed to a particular brand rather than to
autonomous driving as an abstract concept. That may hold no consolation for the affected
brand; but it does indicate—at least insofar as the beneﬁts of autonomous driving are
undisputed—that this type of problem would impact the competition between the man-
ufacturers, but not autonomous driving as a technology in itself. And that is already the
case for other technologies today.
Overall, the public risk constellation tends towards being unproblematic. It cannot be
compared with genetic engineering or nuclear technology: there is no catastrophic sce-
nario, the beneﬁt is readily apparent, the introduction proceeds through a market and not
by decree ‘from above’. And it would probably not occur overnight ‘at the ﬂip of a
switch,’ but gradually.
30.5.2 Risk and Acceptance
Acceptance (Chap. 29) cannot be ‘manufactured,’ as is sometimes expected, but can only
‘develop’ (or not). This ‘development’ depends on many factors, some of which can
certainly be inﬂuenced. In rough terms, public as well as individual acceptance depend
largely on perceptions of the beneﬁts and risks. It is crucial that the expected beneﬁts not
be couched exclusively in abstract macroeconomic terms, but actually comprise concrete
beneﬁts for those who would use the new technologies. Also critical is the ability to
658
A. Grunwald
inﬂuence whether or not one is exposed to risks. Acceptance is generally much easier
when the individuals can choose for themselves (e.g. to go skiing or not) than when
people are exposed to risks by external entities and are thus effectively subjected to the
control of others.
Another important factor with respect to risk concerns is a (relatively) just and com-
prehensible distribution of beneﬁts and risks (this was the main problem in the genetic
engineering debate; see above). And it is absolutely essential that the involved institutions
(manufacturers, operators, regulators, monitoring and control authorities) enjoy public
trust and that the impression does not arise that there is an effort to ‘push the thing
through’ on the backs of the affected with their concerns. To achieve this, communication
about possible risks must be conducted in an environment of openness—nothing is more
suspect from a mass-media standpoint than to assert that there are no risks and that
everything is under control. Concerns and questions must be taken seriously and must not
be dismissed a priori as irrational. All of this requires early and open communication with
relevant civil society groups as well as in the mass media sphere, and where appropriate in
the spirit of ‘participatory technology development.’
There is some reason to believe that for the acceptance of autonomous driving,
expected beneﬁts will outweigh concerns regarding risks. After all, conventional driving is
an almost universally accepted technology in spite of over 3000 trafﬁc deaths annually in
Germany. In contrast with nuclear energy, for example, the scope of potential damage
appears limited both geographically and in terms of time. Other societal risks (see above;
e.g. surveillance) are more abstract in nature, while the expected beneﬁts are, in part, very
tangible. I would therefore turn the juxtaposition “abstract social gain - concrete human
loss” (Chap. 27) on its head: abstract risks such as dependence on complex technologies
or privacy problems versus concrete individual beneﬁts in terms of safety and comfort.
A focus on risks would therefore presumably miss the core of the challenge: the decisive
factor seems to be the expected beneﬁts.
That only applies, of course, because the risk assessment identiﬁed no dramatic results.
Instead, the risk constellation for autonomous driving represents “business as usual” in the
course of technological advancement—undoubtedly with its trade-offs and societal risks,
but also with the opportunity to deal with them responsibly and civilly. In particular the
presumably gradual introduction of autonomous driving and the resultant opportunity to
learn and improve in conjunction with the absence of catastrophic-scale risks somewhat
diminish the importance of risk questions in the further course of the debate on autono-
mous driving in relation to, say, labor market or social justice concerns. Rather than
focusing on risk, it seems appropriate to regard the elements and options of autonomous
driving as parts of an attractive mobility future with greater safety and efﬁciency, more
social justice and more convenience/ﬂexibility. Of course, there is no zero-risk scenario—
but that has not been the case with conventional driving either.
Two major acceptance risks remain. One is the possibility of scandalization of prob-
lems in test drives or technical failures, perhaps in the context of accidents, through media
reporting (read moose test). The consequences would be difﬁcult to predict. But here again
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
659
it must be noted that the moose test did not give rise to rejection of the technology of
driving in itself. The problem—presuming the correctness of the assumption that expected
beneﬁts are more important for acceptance than risk concerns—would be more that any
reputational damage would affect the respective brands rather than the technology of
autonomous driving in itself.
The second big unknown is human psychology. Whether and to what degree people
will entrust their lives and health to autonomous driving is an open question. There are no
known cases of acceptance problems for other autonomous transportation systems such as
subways or shuttle services. But railway vehicles are perceived differently than cars;
because in rail transport one is always driven rather than driving oneself; because the
respective systems are controlled centrally by the control system; and because the com-
plexity and possibility of unforeseen events in many situations is considerably greater in
automobile trafﬁc than in railway cars.
Another aspect with regard to acceptance is that in conventional automobile trans-
portation a well-developed culture of damage adjustment is in place through the trafﬁc
courts, appraisers and insurance companies that has reached a high degree of precision and
reliability. Autonomous driving, by contrast, would pose new challenges to the damage
adjustment system as the question of “Who caused the damage, man or machine?” would
have to be answered in an unambiguous and legally unassailable manner. Acceptance of
autonomous driving will therefore largely depend on the development of answers to these
questions that are equal to the precision of today’s damage adjustment system (Chaps. 4
and 5).
30.5.3 Elements of Societal Risk Management
This diagnosis of the risk constellation for autonomous driving from the societal per-
spective suggests, indeed demands, the following risk management measures:
– Registration criteria for autonomous vehicles must be deﬁned by the responsible
authorities; with regard to safety standards, both fundamental ethical questions (how
safe is safe enough?) and political aspects (e.g. distributive justice, data protection)
must be taken into account and handled on the legislative/regulatory level as
appropriate.
– Key will be the legal regulation of dealing with the possible and small-scale accidents
in autonomous driving, and in particular adjustment processes. Product liability in
particular will have to be resolved (Chaps. 25 and 26).
– Adaptation or expansion of the current trafﬁc laws would have to be considered in this
context.
– The change would affect driving schools with regard to the competences required for
users of autonomous vehicles, and in particular for the switch from ‘manual’ to ‘au-
tonomous’ mode and vice versa.
660
A. Grunwald
– Crucial for risk management are safety measures to ensure both that autonomously
guided vehicles can safely stop in critical situations and that they provide passive
protection for occupants in the event of an accident.
– From this perspective, dispensing with passive safety measures such as seatbelts and
airbags would only be legitimate once sufﬁcient positive experience had been gained
with autonomous driving to justify such a move. This idea should therefore not be
presented as a prospect too early in the process.
– The expected gradual introduction of the technologies of autonomous driving opens up
a variety of possibilities for monitoring and ‘improving on the job.’ Their use in the
form of new sensor and evaluation technologies should be an important element of the
societal risk management scenario (Chaps. 17, 21 and 28).
– Risks for the labor market should be observed closely; if job losses are foreseeable,
early action should be taken to arrange educational and re-training opportunities for
those affected.
– Signiﬁcant problems with data protection and privacy are to be expected if autono-
mous driving takes place within networked systems (although autonomous driving
does not pose speciﬁc issues in this regard compared to other ﬁelds). Technical and
legal measures (Chap. 24) should be introduced here to take account of the
wide-ranging public debate on these issues (e.g. NSA, indiscriminate data collection).
– In terms of innovation and business policy, it is incumbent upon national governments
to discuss with the automobile manufacturers adequate distribution of the business
risks that would cause major economic damage in the event of adverse incidents, e.g.
damage to a company’s reputation due to highly publicized breakdowns or accidents.
– As for risk management in relation to public communication and information policy,
the aforementioned lessons from the debates on nuclear energy and nanotechnology
are instructive with regard to the need to establish trust.
– Involving stakeholders is naturally important and decisive for the societal introduction,
or ‘adoption,’ of autonomous driving. This would include principally the drivers’
associations which are so inﬂuential in Germany. In terms of public opinion, the mass
media play a crucial role. Consumer protection is naturally also an important
consideration.
– For modern technology development, it is critically important that it not be conducted
entirely within a more or less closed world of engineers, scientists and managers,
which is then obliged to plead for acceptance of its own developments after the fact.
Instead, the development process—at least the parts which do not directly affect the
competitive interests of the companies—should take place with a certain degree of
openness. The aforementioned stakeholders should be involved in the development
process itself and not just in the later market-launch phase. Ethical questions about
how to deal with risks and legal questions regarding the distribution of responsibility
should be examined in parallel with the technical development and publicly discussed.
30
Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving …
661
Many of the challenges mentioned here are of a complex system type. In this respect,
system research on various levels is especially important. Autonomous driving should not
be regarded simply as a replacement of today’s vehicles by autonomously guided ones,
but as an expression of new mobility concepts in a changing society.

Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride:
Autonomous Driving and Car Usage

31.1
Introduction
For over a century, the automobile has shaped our physical mobility like no other means
of transport. For almost as long, however, it has also been the subject of criticism sur-
rounding the ecological, social and health consequences of automobility.
Autonomous driving may bring with it upheaval in how individuals and society deal
with the car, and thus also impact transport, mobility or urban structures. Recently, it has
received much public attention—in the mass media it has become part of regular news
reporting and is even taken up, discussed and shared on social platforms. There is public
discussion of how technology is currently (perceived) to be developing, but also of the
possible radical change in how cars will be used, which would be accompanied by altered
attitudes to cars and driving. Expected changes, for instance, include a dramatic drop in the
current rate of car ownership [1, 2], a reduction in the space currently needed for parking
[3], and a transformation in car ownership and usage in favor of carsharing ﬂeets [4].
The topic’s growing prominence demonstrates that the debate surrounding autonomous
driving and autonomous vehicles is evidently cropping up more and more in society. In
any transition to a potential new era of car ownership and usage, it is important to ask
early on what people associate with autonomous driving. How do they perceive the
technology and the ensuing debate? In what contexts is such a debate embedded? What

are people’s hopes, fears, and fantasies? Where is the technology viewed with optimism or
skepticism, as being feasible or even as impossible?
An initial systematic in-depth structuring of the topic from road users’ point of view
has focused on the wealth of various topics, perceptions, and assessments presently
associated with autonomous driving (for details of this exploratory study’s survey and
ﬁndings see Chap. 29). In this connection, it has become clear that autonomous driving is
assessed strongly from a subjective usage context, and is also tightly bound up with the
motives, value systems, and practices of using private cars. The choice of transport mode
—the decision to use a particular transport means—is in turn a deeply rooted part of our
everyday praxis, which can be expected to change little by little rather than by leaps and
bounds (cf. [5, 6]). It is not currently clear what a future with autonomous vehicles might
look like, and which areas of our daily lives, communal life, or mobility will be subject to
change. Examining autonomous driving within the scope of everyday practices, of which
car usage and ownership form part makes the context of the technology more conceivable.
This article ﬁrst looks at the latest research on car use and ownership. Using selected
ﬁndings from previous surveys, we then direct the focus to use-related perspectives on
autonomous driving (these perspectives speciﬁcally refer to the use cases developed
within the Villa Ladenburg project see Chap. 2). In this context, we will also examine the
role of motivations for using and owning cars.
31.2
We Drive … and Drive … and Drive …
The question of why people use cars has occupied scientists of various disciplines—
including psychology, sociology, transportation science, economics and social sciences in
particular—for almost as long as the automobile has been in existence [7]. This debate has
been a highly emotional one again and again (cf. [7, 8]); literature and studies on the
individual and societal beneﬁts of car usage are clearly in the minority (see [9, 10]). In
light of the discussion of more sustainable ways of living, to which reducing motorized
personal transport could signiﬁcantly contribute, the search for the reasons behind car
usage has intensiﬁed in recent years, which can be seen in the increasing numbers of both
academic and popular-science papers and articles on the subject.
The automobile is part of a complex, non-linear system—the system of automobility—
which always reproduces the preconditions for its own expansion (which can be seen in
potent and complex technical, political and social relationships between industry, sup-
pliers, infrastructure, resource use, and urban and regional planning etc. [11]). This has led
to the onset of path dependency and a “lock-in” effect which can hardly be reversed (see
[11–13]). Stotz (2001) points out how the car as a technical artifact is actively integrated
into social and societal (socialization) processes, and in this way acquires the status of
subject rather than of an object (see [14]). Other authors have also remarked that the car
itself has not appeared to be an external object for quite some time now, but rather seems
to be a symbolic extension of the human body (see [15–17]). There are also a series of
666
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
studies, however, that highlight the car’s signiﬁcance for physical and mental well-being,
and even for higher life expectancy (see [18–20]).
The motivations that have been empirically uncovered for using or owning a car are
manifold. In the following, we shall brieﬂy outline the foremost and most up-to-date
attempts at explanation.
31.2.1 What Are the Reasons and Motives for Using Cars?
Instrumental motives
For a long time, the motives for using and owning cars was explained by behavioral
models mainly based on instrumental or utilitarian aspects (see [21]). In order to fulﬁll
their everyday mobility needs—that is to say, to undertake various activities at various
locations—people resort to several means of getting around (car, bike, train, etc.). The
reasons for this, goes the assumption, are based on the speciﬁc beneﬁts they bring with
them, e.g. availability, speed, monetary costs, ﬂexibility, safety, convenience, etc. Who-
ever, therefore, chooses the car to get around—when, for example, desiring to get from A
to B more quickly, or setting off on holiday in as good-value and comfortable a way as
possible, or getting to work when it is far from home—deems it more favorable than other
transport means. Whether the advantages a car brings are objectively measurable is a
secondary matter here; what is at issue is a subjectively perceived beneﬁt, which need not
correspond to any actual one (see [22]).
Urban development concepts such as “New Urbanism” or “Smart Growth” primarily
involve the assumption that instrumental aspects are decisive in how transport modes are
chosen. This then shapes infrastructural, transport-planning, and policy activities—areas
with greater settlement density and mix of uses (residential, work, shopping, leisure) aim
to shorten trip lengths and times, and should enable a reduction in motorized private
transport (see [23–26]).
Affective motives
Instrumental reasons alone, however, are not sufﬁcient in themselves to fully explain
decisions made when choosing transport modes [27, 28]. Furthermore, they cannot always
be clearly distinguished from other motives. Independence and freedom, the dominant
reasons for using cars, can both be interpreted as instrumental and affective aspects. The
freedom—free from timetables, for example—to drive off at any moment can be a rational
basis for taking the car. At the same time, this freedom can also give a feeling of autonomy
and independence—an emotionally colored reason to drive (see [6, 29]).
Affective or emotional factors play a signiﬁcant role in both everyday driving and
journeys made for leisure. Transport means such as the car are tightly bound up with
emotions and feelings that in turn exert considerable inﬂuence on what modes are, and are
31
Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
667
not, selected. This is the case even though car users are often inclined, in direct surveys, to
rationalize their motives and motivations, and let emotional aspects ‘go by the board’ [28].
Driving can thus be accompanied by feelings of relaxation and pleasure, excitement and
elation, the joy of driving or of speed, but also by stress and tension. As a rule, car driving
is associated with positive feelings [30–32].
The car as status symbol, symbolic motives and cultural symbolic meaning
Alongside instrumental and affective motives, symbolic motives also inﬂuence the
choosing of cars (or transport modes in general). In doing so, they fulﬁll two functions:
First, a personal value may be expressed by using or owning a speciﬁc vehicle. Second,
this may then underscore a certain position in the social order. A car may, for instance,
signify status and prestige, or perhaps a particular attitude to life [28–30, 33, 34].
Furthermore, cars also serve as a cultural symbol. They represent progress, freedom,
individuality, and sophistication. They inspire music, art, literature, ﬁlm, and advertising.
They have an impact on family life, social interaction, and cultural rituals, and are an
integral component of initiation rites in modern society (see [11, 35–37]).
Further approaches
Beyond the not always clear-cut distinctions of instrumental, affective, and symbolic
motives (for more on this, see [6, 38]), a number of recent studies and debates have placed
cars and the reasons for using them more clearly in the context of a sociotechnical system.
This research has thrown light on the way cars fulﬁll speciﬁc social functions: how, for
instance, they perpetuate geographical inequalities and divisions, shape social construc-
tions, or how they can ﬁx national and cultural identities [14, 39–43].
A further important topic, in the context of our work on the interrelationship between
car ownership and autonomous driving, is the car as “private space” (see [44, 45]). For
some, the “cocoon” car, an “inhabited” space, can function as a refuge from what is felt to
be stressful, hectic, loud, and overcrowded modern life. Moreover, it also holds special
signiﬁcance for social interaction. Laurier und Dant [46] have examined the signiﬁcance
of this “inhabited” space and the emergent increasing vehicle automation. They point out
that liberation from the driving task ﬁts in with cars’ evolutionary development over
recent decades. This trend is far less a matter of expressing identity (as also manifested in
sports cars’ loss of signiﬁcance and the increase in closed vehicles with large interiors)
than one of temporarily “inhabiting” a space that also enables social interaction. Such
studies consistently stress that it is social factors, far more than individual ones, that can
play a considerable role in the way cars are favored. Inside an automobile, people take on
the same speciﬁc social roles that they assume in their other social interactions (being a
parent, friend or worker, etc.) [42, 47].
In this context, newer studies on how people value their time spent travelling when
using various transport modes could also be of use (see [27, 48]). For a long time, driving
cars was viewed as unproductive, lost time—the frequently monotonous, unvarying way
668
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
to work was a typical example of this burden [49]. That time spent in a car is certainly
subjectively perceived as valuable, however, and may even be viewed as a “gift,” has been
recently demonstrated by Jain and Lyons [48] with their study on commuters. Travel times
were here seen as time for relaxing from everyday hustle and bustle, a transition time
between work and home. These ﬁndings are in line with an earlier work on commuting, in
which Mokhtarian et al. (2001) were already able to show that time spent in a car is
certainly not always seen as wasted [27].
31.2.2 Summary
At present, car usage and ownership is approaching a saturation point in industrial nations,
which is not to say that the car will fall from its dominant position so easily because of this
[50]. For the vast majority of car users, it will far more likely retain its signiﬁcance in
fulﬁlling their daily needs ([51]: 114). What is of prime importance in the debate on the future
uses of autonomous cars (and also their acceptance) is to take into consideration the com-
plexity of instrumental, affective, and symbolic aspects. Technology’s perceived functional
qualities can, at ﬁrst glance, appear to be an easily measurable “objective” beneﬁt, but these
functional aspects only reveal their signiﬁcance in the context of the subjective motivations
—affective and symbolic—that accompany autonomous driving. Furthermore, embedding
instrumental motives for (autonomous) car usage in the context of everyday praxis, and also
of the relevant sociotechnical system, plays a role too. The autonomous vehicle may be
perceived as safe, ﬂexible, and comfortable, but this will only lead to it actually being used if
safety, ﬂexibility or comfort have a speciﬁc signiﬁcance in daily praxis [51].
31.3
Multiple-Method Investigative Approaches
for Autonomous Driving in the Context of Car Usage
and Ownership
The insights from research into car usage and ownership, together with the indications
from the ﬁrst exploratory study on autonomous driving, have formed the conceptual basis
for our follow-up empirical work. The objective of these ongoing studies is to survey, in a
use-oriented fashion, the speciﬁc attributes that road users currently ascribe to autonomous
cars and, in the “translation” of such attributes, to decipher instrumental, affective and
symbolic motives. The questions guiding the research are thus: What characteristics and
assessments do road users associate with autonomous driving and autonomous vehicles?
What various motives are decisive in this? The context of what attributes are currently
ascribed to autonomous driving is also to be analyzed and, where possible, linked to how
people live their daily lives and get around. In this way, it will then be possible to
determine which attitudes and judgments may be expected to have an effect on acceptance
of the technology.
31
Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
669
To this end, a multiple-method procedure was selected. To explore potential variations
in people’s perceptions and judgments, respondents were confronted with speciﬁc use
cases of autonomous driving in a quantitative online survey. This survey also contained a
free-text questionnaire—participants were thus able to ascribe autonomous driving with
attributes in a completely individual way. A more in-depth analysis encompassing the
context in which autonomous driving is presently perceived and viewed allowed for
exploratory qualitative procedures to be pursued in parallel as part of group discussions.
The focus here lay particularly on ambivalence in how technology is viewed (see
Chap. 29), particularly in advance of potential implementation—with both fear and high
expectations. Exploratory qualitative procedures appear to be especially apt for this still
relatively young ﬁeld of research. Until now, there has been barely any insight available
into the attitudes and motives surrounding autonomous driving on the user side—the open
character of such studies helps to decipher these motivations.
31.3.1 Perception and Assessment of Autonomous Driving
in Relation to Specific Use Cases
It may also be expected that each of the four use cases developed in the course of this
project (Chap. 2) will be perceived
and assessed
differently in view
of their
acceptance-relevant aspects. This is because they not only differ in technical terms, but
also in the speciﬁc implications, usage areas, and attributes they are associated with (for
more on this see Chaps. 6, 11, 12, and 32). In a quasi-representative survey, we therefore
recorded differentiated attitudes to autonomous driving with recourse to the use cases.
A thousand people were surveyed, and represented the total German population regarding
gender, age, income, and level of education. An in-depth discussion of the survey—which
was developed and carried out in cooperation with several authors of the present volume
—and sampling can be found in Chap. 6.
A total of 57 % of those surveyed declared they were generally interested in the topic
of autonomous driving. However, 44 % stated they had no knowledge of the subject, and
a mere 4 % termed themselves as being well informed or having specialist knowledge at
all, let alone being an expert. 78 % obtain their information on the topic primarily from
the mass media, 64 % go straight to experts, 56 % discuss it with friends or co-workers,
and 40 % share and compare notes on social media.
Following a general section with questions on sociodemographics, mobility behavior,
travel requirements, etc. the respondents were each randomly allocated one of four sce-
narios based on the use cases. Each scenario was introduced with a short description:
Scenario for Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability: On freeways or similar
roadways, the driver can hand over control to the vehicle. The driver does not have to pay
attention to other trafﬁc or the driving task in this time, and can pursue other activities.
Scenario for Autonomous Valet Parking: After all passengers have got out of the vehicle, it
can drive itself to a pre-determined parking space and also from there to a pick-up address.
670
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
Scenario for Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability: Whenever and
wherever desired or required, the driver can hand over control to the vehicle. The driver does
not have to pay attention to other trafﬁc or the driving task in this time, and can pursue other
activities.
Scenario for Vehicle on Demand: A vehicle on demand drives its passengers without the
presence of any human driver. People themselves can no longer drive in such vehicles – the
vehicle’s interior will thus also have neither steering wheel nor pedals.
A follow-up question to each use case as it was introduced enquired whether the
respondents would essentially be prepared to replace their till-now preferred transport
mode with an autonomous vehicle. This question has had already been put to them in the
same form in the ﬁrst, general part of the survey, but there it was relatively unspeciﬁcally
termed “an autonomous vehicle” with no further explanation. Altogether the respondents
had relatively little desire to replace their own vehicle (or “favorite mode of transport”)
with an autonomous vehicle—whether precisely speciﬁed or not. Only between 11 and
15 % agreed to this statement in large or full measure (see Fig. 31.1). However, 27 % said
they could hardly imagine, or could not imagine at all, replacing their preferred mode with
a (non-speciﬁed) autonomous vehicle. When, as in the survey, autonomous driving is
proposed in relation to a speciﬁc use case, this degree of refusal increases sharply, to
between 44 and 54 %. This means that refusal becomes stronger with more precise
scenario descriptions. The lowest acceptance, incidentally, is for Vehicle on Demand—
54 % would not wish to replace their favored mode with it and only 11 % could envisage
it at all.
To explore what the respondents currently associate with autonomous vehicles, they
were asked to declare in their own words, in up to ﬁfteen free-text boxes, what they
understand by the term “autonomous vehicle.” The short descriptions (see above) were
also a basis here. The following analysis refers solely to the answers of those respondents
Fig. 31.1 Preparedness to replace the preferred means of transport with an autonomous vehicle
31
Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
671
who had been allocated the “Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability”
(referred to as “Fully automated vehicle” in the following) and “Vehicle on Demand” use
cases.
The answers of the 250 respondents were summarized and categorized by hand, then
allotted speciﬁc connotations (see below). For “Fully automated vehicle” there were a
total of 3750 entries; of these, 2587 (69 %) were invalid for various reasons because it was
not possible to make out a reference to the question, for example. For Vehicle on Demand,
there were also 3750 entries overall, of which 2512 (67 %) were unusable. Figure 31.2
shows the distribution of statements with various connotations: positive, ambivalent,
negative or without connotation—the invalid entries have already been taken out at this
point, the percentages refer to the remaining mentions.
While the majority of descriptions of Fully automated vehicle are positive, the same
can only be said of 38 % of deﬁnitions applied to Vehicle on Demand. For these two use
cases, 36 and 40 % of the statements respectively had negative connotations. A small
portion of the perceptions (5 and 4 % respectively) were ambivalent, i.e. they could not
clearly be connoted as positive or negative.
Overall, the qualities that the respondents attributed, independently of one another, to
each of the two scenarios turned out to be relatively similar. Many answer categories are
both equivalent in meaning and similar in their percentage distribution. We shall turn next

regarding autonomous driving:

to some of the notable differences. We shall also examine the attributes given, where
possible, for what instrumental, emotional, and symbolic characteristics are ascribed to
autonomous vehicles.
Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability
In the “positive assessments” segment, 17 % of statements were in the category of
“comfortable,” followed by “good” (13 %), “safe” (11 %), “relaxing” (10 %), and
“modern” (10 %)—these proportions are given in Table 31.1. Among the “ambivalent
assessments,” 8 % of the answers came in the “luxury” category, and 15 % of all

Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
673
“negative assessments” were because they viewed the scenarios as “expensive.” In this
negative segment, only the answer category of “not for me” was more highly represented,
at 16 %. “Luxury” was not once mentioned in connection with Vehicle on Demand,
however, and, at 7 % of all statements, “expensive” only came in at seventh place.
In the positive assessments segment, Fully automated vehicle was mainly associated
with functional or instrumental aspects—vehicles such as these are described as “com-
fortable,” “safe,” “practical,” “efﬁcient,” “for the mobility-impaired,” “helpful,” “envi-
ronmentally friendly,” and “ﬂexible.” Vehicle on Demand was also deemed “useful,”
although no-one deemed it “helpful.” Regarding Fully automated vehicle, only the pos-
itive attributes of “relaxing,” “brilliant,” and “exciting” could be termed as emotional or
affective. The same applies for Vehicle on Demand, though the relatively weaker con-
notations of “great” and “good” categories were expressed instead of “brilliant.” As for
the negative assessments, on the other hand, the distribution of functionally versus
emotionally connoted aspects is reversed. “Weird,” “boring,” “dangerous,” and “terrible”
are clearly affective categories (and are joined in the case of Vehicle on Demand by
“scary”), while “expensive” and “insufﬁciently developed” denote more functional
aspects. Answer categories that may be assumed to have a symbolic connotation are
scarcely to be found among the statements. Statements in the “modern,” “interesting” or
“luxury” categories most likely indicate that such autonomous vehicles are perceived and
assessed in terms of aspects concerning the status manifested in the vehicles themselves.
Vehicle on Demand
The summarized and categorized attributes given for the Vehicle on Demand can be seen in
percentage in Table 31.2. The top answer categories in the area of “positive assessments”
hardly differ from those for Fully automated vehicle. Only in ﬁrst place do we see a
completely new category of “useful,” with 15 % of all statements made in this segment.
After this, the respondents go on to describe the vehicle as “comfortable” (14 %), “re-
laxing” (13 %), “modern” (12 %), and “safe” (10 %). Eighteen percent of statements made
about Vehicle on Demand have no judgment attached to them. Half of these come under the
“no idea” category—only 20 % of respondents, in comparison, declared they had “no idea”
about Fully automated vehicle. Only 2 % of statements in the “no valuation” column were
in the category of “similar to other transport modes,” whereas this applied to 12 % of those
made about Fully automated vehicle. This category included entries such as “Fully auto-
mated vehicle is ‘like the railroad’” or “Vehicle on Demand is ‘a taxi.’”
A quarter of all negative statements on Vehicle on Demand fall under the highly
emotionally cast categories of “scary” (10 %), “dangerous” (7 %), “weird” (6 %), and
“terrible” (2 %). In contrast, not a single respondent found Fully automated vehicle to be
“scary,” and only 15 % termed it “weird” (11 %), “dangerous” (11 %), or “terrible” (1 %).
674
E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
31.3.1.1
Summary
Overall the survey clearly demonstrates that Vehicle on Demand is the subject of the
greatest number of negative and fewest positive assessments. Of the 250 respondents
allocated to this use case, 54 % could not imagine replacing their currently preferred mode
of transport with a Vehicle on Demand. In direct comparison with Full Automation Using
Driver for Extended Availability, Vehicle on Demand is described with rather negative
statements, with a quarter of all descriptions even viewing it as scary, dangerous, weird, or
terrible. Clearly, this means that fewer respondents could imagine using a Vehicle on
Demand than one they can still drive themselves, as is shown by the number of statements
professing “no idea.”

Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
675
The answer categories of “expensive” and “luxury,” which are either especially or
exclusively attributed to Full Automation, indicate that such vehicles are still clearly
linked with individual private ownership. Vehicle on Demand, on the other hand, is
compared with other transport modes little or not at all.
Classifying the statements on autonomous driving in terms of their instrumental,
affective or symbolic aspects revealed that instrumental attributes predominate among
positively connoted assessments. Strongly emotional statements, on the other hand, form
the majority of negative accounts. Descriptions foregrounding the status character of
autonomous vehicles, in contrast, were scarcely to be found. In the qualitative survey
described in the following section, we shall take a closer look at the perceived negative
aspects of autonomous driving, and ask which sociodemographic contexts they are
embedded in. Such hostile attributes, in particular, are evidently strongly aligned with
subject-related and affective issues as well as the context of car use and ownership, as the
exploratory study has already shown (Chap. 29).
31.3.2 Autonomous Driving in the Future: “Do We Really Want
to Live Like That?”1
The following ﬁndings are based on three group discussions in Berlin whose composition
varied each time. All participants had a high level of education; some were in academia,
studying or working at a university or other research institutes. The discussions involved
ﬁve, six, and seven participants respectively. All those involved were living in Berlin,
seven of them were women. The gap between oldest and youngest was greatest in the ﬁrst
discussion round, with the youngest 20 years of age, the oldest 50. All participants
regularly used a car, though not all of them owned one. At the end of each discussion, data
on sociodemographics, transport behavior, and car use and ownership were collected. All
those taking part had already heard of autonomous driving before the discussion sessions.
At the beginning of the session, the participants were given an illustrated narrative
scenario of autonomous driving in the form of an A4 ﬂyer. There were two different
scenarios—one on “Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability,” the other
on “Vehicle on Demand.” Each group was introduced to one of the scenarios, which they
then considered within group-based introspection. The aim of this introspection is to make
explicit the processes of “inward observation”, that is to say, to consciously direct con-
centration and attention towards interior processes ([52]: 493, translation by the authors).
Under the guidance of a research person, a group’s participants address the research object
in question and document their own inner processes and experiences independently of one
another. Finally, they share what they have found via self-observation with the group
without commenting or passing judgment on each other’s accounts. In a second stage, the

E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
group members—keen explore the topic further from hearing others’ experiences—add to
their reports. Together with the scenario, the participants received the following
instructions:
You have just received a short description of a scenario involving the cars of the future – a
short story on what the driving of tomorrow might look like. Please read the story carefully.
Try to imagine yourself in what you read and think about your feelings, fantasies, and
sensations – be open for anything and everything that crops up as you think about the topic!
Please make notes on where your thoughts lead you.
The participants then each read out their notes in turn, as a so-called “introspection
report.” The reports are later transcribed and evaluated by means of qualitative heuristics.
Unlike everyday procedures of discovery, which are frequently made unconsciously,
qualitative heuristics is “rule-directed and supplied with a methodology,” and takes the
form of systematized and intersubjectively traceable search-and-ﬁnd procedures ([53]:
226, translation by the authors). The method is based on four rules:
1. Openness of the research person and subjects
2. Openness of the research object
3. Maximum structural variation of perspectives
4. Analysis of commonalities.
Furthermore, qualitative heuristics uses the so-called dialogic principle: A question is
asked of an object (in the study, the transcribed introspection reports) which gives “an-
swers.” New questions are then asked from another perspective, or a different angle, and
so the process continues. The research object and research person are thus in close
dialogic contact, which also serves to soften the strict division between (research) subject
and (research) object.
After producing introspection reports, the groups started open discussions, which were
aligned on the implicit behavioral patterns (see [54]) in car usage and ownership. In now
giving our results, however, we shall focus on what the participants conveyed in their
introspection reports.
31.3.3 Results
The scenarios allocated to the group discussion participants stimulated great interest in the
topic, but also critical questioning. In what follows, we shall describe some examples
of topics that had already proved signiﬁcant in the earlier, exploratory survey.
The introspection reports show an ambivalent attitude to autonomous driving that is
comparable to the results of the study given in Chap. 29.
In addition, however, it became clearer which speciﬁc fears and worries relate to
autonomous driving, and what social context it is seen in. We shall take a closer look at the
range of hostility towards autonomous driving below—the results stem from both groups
who were given the “Full Automation Using Driver for Extended Availability” scenario.

Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
677
31.3.3.1
Skepticism About a Future with Autonomous Vehicles
For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned at this point that, in the scenario
stories provided to the participants, the protagonist “Yvonne” used the time made free to
her from not having to drive herself to pursue work activities (e.g. email correspondence),
among other things. Although other activities were also covered alongside this, the story
did tend to focus more on typical organizational activities (taking the kids to school, doing
the shopping, etc.) than on leisure and relaxation pursuits (looking out the window,
watching movies, sleeping/relaxing, etc.). It is therefore possible that skeptical and hostile
attitudes on the part of (especially younger) group members towards autonomous driving
could be down to the fact that life in the future was so clearly depicted as being full of
structured and optimized everyday tasks.
On the other hand, the qualities and attributes ascribed to autonomous driving by the
participants can clearly be classiﬁed in terms of the earlier surveys, with the same
ascriptions cropping up again and again in both the exploratory study and the quantitative
questionnaire.
The “accelerated service society”
That it will in future be possible to spend time on other activities in an autonomous vehicle
was largely viewed negatively in the discussions. In their orally read-out introspection
reports, the participants expressed concern about no longer needing to concentrate on the
driving task in future. This, they thought, could lead to private, leisure, and work activities
becoming too closely mixed up with one another. Ultimately, this line of thought runs,
technology may further a trend that many people today already identify as alarming: a
society ever-more oriented towards performance and efﬁciency:
Johanna2
“And private life and working life are mixing more and more and you become
a total workaholic.”
Timo
“This strain of having to do more and more things in the same place at the
same time is increasing.”
The freedom and the opportunity to occupy oneself during the car journey in other ways
may result in pressure to put this time in the service of efﬁciency. Having to concentrate
while driving conventionally, on the other hand, was painted in a positive light:
Johanna
“That’s actually a nice thing about driving, that you have to concentrate on it in
the moment and you also do something with your hands, and you precisely aren’t
already checking emails from work. That starts when you’re sat at your desk.”
2The names of the participants have been changed to protect their anonymity, and the quotes have
been translated.

E. Fraedrich and B. Lenz
“This dependency on technology”
One further consequence linked to autonomous driving is a future dependency on tech-
nology, which may also entail an accompanying large degree of loss of control, which is
viewed negatively. Technology dependence and loss of control are also seen as prob-
lematic because there is skepticism as to the reliability of a technology over whose
decisions one will no longer have any inﬂuence:
Nico
“In certain situations you can simply decide spontaneously, and you might
actually have a much better feeling for it than the car.”
Julian
“And obviously it won’t be possible to intervene immediately either if I ﬁrst have
to hear 5, 4, 3, 2, 1…beep.”
Evidently, behind such worries lies a fundamental skepticism regarding technology, all
the more so when it greatly impinges on individual safety, as in the case of autonomous
driving:
Julian
“Not even my kettle gets my blind trust, why should I then blindly trust my car
with my life? I somehow ﬁnd that incredibly disconcerting.”
Life is being “de-funned” and “you’ll get idle”
The abolition of the driving task in autonomous vehicles is viewed highly critically. The
main idea here is that a vehicle in which one does not drive oneself would curtail fun,
spontaneity, individuality, ﬂexibility, and control (it is interesting to note here that the
participants had actually been given the Full Automation with Driver for Extended
Availability story, where—as is described in the scenario—the driver can certainly still
drive themselves whenever they like):
Johanna
“What is actually then the difference to public transportation? Because what I
actually always appreciate about a car is that it is in my own hands—that I can
judge for myself. And if I’m running a little late, then I can step on the gas a little.”
The “de-funning” (Timo) comment refers on the one hand very speciﬁcally to losing
the fun of driving, but also to the lifestyle that could have the fun removed from it by
autonomous driving:
Bettina
“You’ll stop needing to move so much because you’ll be able to get picked up by
the car everywhere; you’ll get lazy, you’ll get idle, you’ll only ever take the car,
because it doesn’t matter if you’re feeling ill or how you are – you can take the
car for every trip you make.”
Social isolation: “Nobody needs anybody anymore”.
The consequence of such “de-funning” and idleness is, in the view of the group members,
that humans in the end will be replaced. “Nobody needs anybody anymore” (Inga), there
31
Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
679
would then be a machine for everything and, in this way, even thinking would be done for
you:
Inga
“The car drives, you no longer have to drive yourself. Food is delivered in one way
or another, you cower a touch autistically in your apartment and grow dull, you
don’t have to think anymore, you google or subject yourself to cat videos. So you
basically become completely stupid.”
System weaknesses: How truly “autonomous” are autonomous cars?
Overall, trust in the safety of autonomous vehicles appears to still be on the low side. This
leads the participants into wide-ranging speculation: “How predictable are these cars,
then?” and, “What about when the system breaks down and there is no internet access?”
(Nico), “Can they be driven remotely?” (Thorsten), “What happens when this system gets
hacked?” and, “Can these autonomous cars really be autonomous?” (Bettina), “Just
where, then, is the evidence that the whole thing is going to be safe?” (Herta).
Behind such questions and statements, there is great insecurity regarding the
still-unknown technology, and the possibility that dangers may accompany it. At the same
time, the participants currently appear to be completely unclear as to who is behind the
development of this technology and who is responsible for the system’s safety. Who
would be liable in case of an accident? Who would accept the damages? And most
important: Who would accept responsibility in the ethical sense?
“Social and economic consequences”
The examination of autonomous driving also turns up the worry that the technology will
lead to job losses in various sectors (the automotive industry, taxi and delivery services,
etc.). This is connected to the idea that autonomous vehicles will result in less variety
across the spectrum of automobiles: “If you only have this large one” (Bettina), auton-
omous driving would in the end be accompanied by “greater monopolization” (Eddie).
31.3.4 Summary
The issues raised in the group discussions concerning autonomous driving are embedded in
a sociotechnological context that simultaneously uncovers negative and problem-centered
ideas of society in future. Overall, the participants tend to take a hostile position vis-à-vis
autonomous driving. Although positive aspects are also perceived, these are neither
embedded in a speciﬁc usage context nor associated with positive ideas of future society—
at least not to the same extent as the negative ones.
Fears expressed in connection to a future with autonomous driving concern social
isolation, social and economic consequences, over-reliance on technology, increasing
idleness, and the pressure to keep up in a primarily performance-oriented society.

Conclusion
The results from the quantitative questionnaire challenge the currently widespread
assumption that autonomous driving can expect general openness and a high degree of
acceptance (see [55–57]). Such openness is to be found in our study, but only when the
question of what an autonomous vehicle is left unspeciﬁed. When the respondents are
introduced to concrete use cases of autonomous driving, however, their assessments turn
out to be far more negative. Assessments of Vehicle on Demand in particular suggest that
some forms of autonomous driving are still relatively far away from people’s speciﬁc
ideas of what a vehicle is, and also their ideas of how to get around. Among other things,
the negative assessment arises from people feeling more “exposed” to potential risks and
dangers that may arise in a Vehicle on Demand than they feel able to “control”, as they
will no longer be able to control the vehicle themselves at all. Overall, it is currently
debatable whether most people have any picture of what “autonomous driving” might
mean. In the quantitative survey, 44 % of respondents still indicated they knew nothing
about the subject, which clearly shows that awareness of it is far from penetrating all
corners of society. These ﬁndings may also be taken as a sign that further studies more
closely focused on the uses and applications of autonomous driving are required.
Furthermore, the negative associations of autonomous driving and autonomous vehi-
cles in particular indicate that a use-oriented examination must also address speciﬁc user
groups. Scenarios to be worked with should, for instance, take even greater account of the
different users’ living environments and systems of relevance. In this connection, it is at
least clear that the level of trust placed in the still relatively unknown technology is on the
low side—it is doubted that autonomous vehicles can be safe at all. At the same time,
people currently have neither any speciﬁc idea what the technology is capable of nor who
is behind its development and, in case of doubt, would accept responsibility for any
potential damage, for example.
The present remarks have primarily looked at people’s “subjective understanding” and
reﬂexive or theoretical knowledge ([58]: 10 ff., [54]: 40 ff.) of autonomous driving and car
use in general. The aim here was to trace how those acting deal reﬂexively with the topic,
and thus also trace their motives, and then to ask: How is car use understood from a
subjective perspective? What do people think about while using one? What intentions
inform their behavior? This level of meaning forms the “orientation scheme” of the
action-guiding knowledge structure. In future empirical work, it will also be necessary to
decipher the orientation frameworks, i.e. the structure of action, and to ask how the praxis
of car usage is produced in milieu- and culture-speciﬁc terms.
Whether autonomous driving will provoke a fundamental transformation in the system
of automobility can currently hardly be predicted—up to now there has been little sign
that the hegemony of automobile usage is in serious danger. Nevertheless, in the end it
may be precisely such a new technology as autonomous driving that sustainably and
irreversibly transforms our transport system. As the sociologist John Urry puts it: “Just as
31
Taking a Drive, Hitching a Ride: Autonomous Driving and Car Usage
681
the internet and the mobile phone came from ‘nowhere’, so the tipping point here will
emerge unpredictably, probably from a set of technologies or ﬁrms or governments not
currently a center of the mobility industry and culture” ([59]: 272).

Consumer Perceptions of Automated
Driving Technologies: An Examination
of Use Cases and Branding Strategies
David M. Woisetschläger
32.1
Introduction
The automated, self-driving vehicle is one of the automobile industry’s major ventures in
the 21st century, driven by rapid advances in information technology [10, 11]. Techno-
logical innovations in the ﬁeld of automated driving promise to contribute positively to the
ﬁnancial bottom line of automobile manufacturers [46]. Their integration as supplementary
equipment increases the contribution margin of each car sold. In addition, automated
mobility functions lay the foundations for new business models such as elaborated navi-
gation services. While industry experts expect that it will take until the middle of the 21st
century until fully automated cars will be available to the mass market [42, 45], automobile
manufacturers have already begun to introduce supportive functions such as lane assistants
and collision avoidance systems to the market [43, 50, 64, 66]. The promising market
predictions suggest a general openness of customers towards using self-driving cars [51].
Besides automobile manufacturers and suppliers, technology ﬁrms such as Google are
pinning their hopes on the predicted potential of automated driving technology [36, 37, 43].
The emergence of technology ﬁrms as competitors poses a threat to the established car
manufacturers [58], as automated driving functions may require different organizational
capabilities such as information technology, and faster innovation cycles, which are
typically strengths of technology ﬁrms such as Apple or Google. Recent industry reports
suggest that Google, as the new market entrant, is by far the brand associated most with
self-driving cars [37]. Moreover, cars not yet in existence from technological ﬁrms receive
similar levels of consideration in consumer surveys to those of established car manu-
facturers [37]. Therefore, on the one hand, established car manufacturers are concerned
about how their current market positions can be defended against potential new entrants.

On the other hand, cooperation with technological ﬁrms could help car manufacturers to
differentiate their brands from their competitors’, especially if partnerships are selective or
exclusive. Announcements of partnerships, such as the cooperation between Audi and
Apple, point in this direction.
At the same time, the role of branding as a critical success factor has been questioned in
many instances. More precisely, the generally high relevance of brands in the context of
cars has been recently put into question. Several studies suggest the diminishing role of
automobiles relative to other products such as smartphones, at least for young customer
segments [12]. The emergence and increasing popularity of access-based mobility systems
such as car-sharing implies a trend towards a more utilitarian perspective on automobiles
[57]. In contrast, some factors contributing to the high relevance of automobile brands
remain relevant, irrespective of potential shifts in the preference hierarchy of product
categories over time. This is because the relevance of a brand as inﬂuencing variable in a
purchasing situation is generally seen as high when the purchase or use is associated with
high levels of risk, information asymmetry, and symbolic value [34].
Existing literature provides comprehensive models for consumer goods, allowing an
assessment of the relative importance of brands as predictor of purchasing behavior. In the
particular context of high technology products, understanding of the role of brand
knowledge is limited. Similarly, extensive knowledge exists about the effects of alter-
native brand strategies such as brand extensions (e.g., new services) or brand alliances,
e.g., [68], and how new product introductions inﬂuence the parent brand perception, e.g.,
[2]. However, an examination for high technology products such as automated driving
technology does not exist.
Against this background, this article contributes to the literature by developing a
conceptual framework depicting relevant drivers of consumer acceptance and conse-
quences of branding in the context of automated cars. Second, this article examines the
relative importance of automobile manufacturer and technology brands for the acceptance
of automated driving technology and services based on these technologies. Third, effects
of the introduction of these technologies in a brand alliance are assessed. Fourth, the
article conceptualizes how differing use-cases are perceived by potential customers. Based
on the results of these empirical studies, implications for theory and management practice
are derived.
32.2
Theoretical Background
32.2.1 Technology-Mediated Services, Service Robots,
and Consumer Acceptance
The emerging phenomenon of assisted and automated driving has been primarily studied
from technological, legal, political, and ethical perspectives (e.g., [5, 7, 14, 26 –28, 30, 35,
41, 48, 52, 55, 62]). Automated driving is deﬁned as the shift of vehicle control from the
688
D.M. Woisetschläger
driver to the vehicle [63], while the extent of automation depends on the level of vehicle
automation. The National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) has deﬁned
ﬁve levels of vehicle automation based on the proportion of driver vs. vehicle control. In its
highest form, the vehicle performs all safety-critical driving functions and monitors
roadway conditions for an entire trip, disengaging the driver from all duties [63]. The vision
of fully automated driving in its highest form is seen as promising in terms of business
potential, safety, and trafﬁc management [21]. Consequently, automobile manufacturers
and technological players such as Apple or Google are investing in the continuous progress
of assisting and automated driving technologies. While this development seems to be
promising from a consumer perspective on the one hand, literature also suggests that
consumers hold strong objections against automated driving technology [25].
While relatively few research articles exist which explicitly focus on consumer per-
ceptions of automated driving technologies (e.g., [51]), different contextual areas such as
studies on self-service technologies, and service robots point at perceived beneﬁts and
problems that are associated with the shift of control from consumers to technology.
Research on consumer acceptance of technology innovations is based on the tech-
nology acceptance model and its subsequent modiﬁcations and generalizations [8, 15 –
17, 47, 60, 65, 67]. Four distinct factors are conceptualized as antecedents of consumer
acceptance and their subsequent behavior. The ﬁrst antecedent, performance expectancy,
refers to the perceived value of the technology. The second variable, effort expectancy, is
deﬁned as the degree of ease associated with the use of the system [65]. Third, social
inﬂuences affecting individuals’ perceptions of subjective norms towards using the
technology inﬂuence consumer acceptance and adoption of a new technology. Fourth,
facilitating conditions such as infrastructure or support contribute to consumer acceptance.
One of the most critical factors of consumer acceptance towards technology innovations
and technology-mediated services is the perception of control. Even in smart-interactive or
remote services which imply a limited and indirect human interaction, perceived loss of
control has been found to be negatively related to consumer acceptance ([70, 71]). In
addition, trust in technology-mediated services has been found to be critical, especially
when the service is perceived as risky [69, 70]. To conclude, research on technology
acceptance and technology-mediated services has identiﬁed the importance of perceived
value, effort, social inﬂuences, facilitating conditions such as perceived behavioral control.
Trust has been identiﬁed as a key prerequisite.
In contrast to research on general technology acceptance and technology-mediated
services, research on consumer perceptions of service robots is still at an early stage. The
studied contexts predominantly focus on robots in smart home environments (e.g. [31, 49])
and healthcare appliances (e.g., [38]). Their research suggests that people prefer robots to
act as trustworthy and controllable facilitators with a focus on interaction and cooperation
rather than autonomously acting performers [23]. In a similar vein, research on robot
companions suggests that people primarily see robots as assistants and serving machines
with only a minority of the studied sample indicating that they would see them as peers or
friends [18]. Research on robot companions recommends that the robot’s role, appearance
32
Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …
689
and behavior should be better matched to human requirements [9]. These ﬁndings point to
the question of how an automated driving robot should relate to its human counterpart [54].
One central aspect of human-machine interaction is the perceived autonomy of the con-
sumer [4, 29]. While the role of consumer autonomy has been addressed directly or indirectly
by some studies, its criticality for consumer acceptance of automated technologies might not
befullycapturedinthecontextsstudied.Restrictingorremovingtheautonomyofindividuals
could cause reactance, i.e., negative psychological and contrary behavioral responses of
consumers as reactions to a perceived restriction of their personal freedoms [6, 44]. Auto-
mated driving systems could be perceived as a threat to drivers’ autonomy, and reactance
could arise in terms of consumer boycott intentions or low adoption rates. Presently, it is
unclear if consumers are willing to accept a loss in control [56].
In the next section, ﬁndings of consumer-based studies on automated driving tech-
nology will be brieﬂy summarized.
32.2.2 Research on Consumer Acceptance of Automated Driving
Technology
Only relatively few domain-speciﬁc studies exist which explicitly focus on consumer
perceptions of automated driving systems. Because consumer knowledge of automated
driving technology is sparse, a recent study analyzes reader comments to 15 distinct
newspaper articles on automated driving in Germany and the US [25]. Their results
provide evidence for the implied value propositions of ﬂexibility and comfort, and
comments relating to the safety and reliability of automated driving technology. The US
comments in particular show negative responses relating to the restriction of freedom,
pointing at the high relevance of consumer autonomy.
A second study that focuses on the contexts of automated medical diagnosis systems
and automated driving provides descriptive evidence for the important role of prominent
brands as risk-reducing mechanism [13]. Four distinct scenarios of future mobility are
developed in a study using a set of experts from car manufacturers, public authorities,
scientists, and environmental groups [19]. Two of the four scenarios relate to automated
driving and distinguish between privately owned and access-based (“shared”) automated
vehicles. Both scenarios perform worse on the individualistic performance relative to the
status quo, while performance advantages are seen on the systemic dimension.
A ﬁrst study quantifying the effects of psychological antecedents on usage and pur-
chase intentions ﬁnds generally positive values for usage intentions among a sample of
421 French consumers [51]. Their ﬁndings suggest signiﬁcant positive inﬂuences of the
general attitude towards automated driving, acceptability, and sensation (i.e., novelty)
seeking on usage intentions. In addition, they ﬁnd a gender effect revealing higher usage
intentions for males. The latter effect is in line with existing literature on technology
adoption, which generally ﬁnds male consumers to be more likely to be early adopters.
690
D.M. Woisetschläger
The present study attempts to build on these ﬁndings and conceptualizes a model which
considers the key variables discussed in this section, the role of branding, and different use
cases of automated driving. In the next chapter, the effects of brand equity, brand alli-
ances, and different use cases on purchase intention are discussed.
32.3
Conceptual Model
32.3.1 Brand Equity, Acceptance Drivers and Purchase Intention
of Automated Cars
Brand equity (BE), deﬁned as the added value endowed by the brand to the product [20], is
regarded as an important concept for both business practice and academic research.
Companies can gain competitive advantage through successful brands because they offer
opportunity for differentiation, increased customer loyalty, and the possibility for charging
price premiums [39]. Strong brands are characterized by measurable differences of what
consumers know about these brands. According to Keller [33], consumer-based
brand-knowledge consists of two dimensions, brand awareness and brand image. Brand
awareness refers to the strength of a brand in memory, and the likelihood and ease with
which the brand will be recognized or recalled under various conditions [59]. Brand image
is deﬁned as the perception of a brand as reﬂected by the brand associations held in
consumer memory [33]. The favorability, strength, and uniqueness of brand image permit
the brand to be strategically differentiated and positioned in the consumer’s mind.
Brand equity has been found to be positively related to customer loyalty and will-
ingness to pay. While strong brands are generally helpful for the marketing of products
and services, the importance of brands has been found to vary across industry sectors, with
a high relevance for the marketing of automobiles [22]. The relevance of branding
strongly depends on the function of the brand as risk reducing factor, its function to
enhance information efﬁciency, and its symbolic value. Since the purchase of a new car is
an extensive decision involving comparably high expenditures and the collection of
extensive information, strong brands can promote the purchasing process.
Besides the sparse empirical evidence for the risk-reducing effects of strong brands in
the context of automated driving [13], the aforementioned brand functions should be
positively related to consumer acceptance of automated driving systems. Knowledge and
experience of consumers with automated driving technology is marginal. In combination
with additional cost for automated driving abilities, consumers are likely to evaluate a
purchase decision as risky. Strong brands can effectively help to reduce perceptions of
risk.
In addition to a distinction between strong and weak automobile and tech-brands,
introducing the respective automated driving system, several additional antecedents are
considered in accordance to the aforementioned literature. More precisely, functional
trust, the perceived convenience of the system, the price-value ratio, and the symbolic
32
Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …
691
value of the system explain why consumers feature high/low levels of purchase intentions.
These factors are likely to be inﬂuenced by the consumers’ perceptions of safety and
security of the system, the perceived autonomy, their privacy concerns [3], and brand
attitude.
To control for differences on a consumer level which are independent from the pre-
sented scenario, the afﬁnity of individuals towards adopting innovations, autonomy
preference, and brand possession are considered below.
32.3.2 Brand Alliances and Purchase Intention of Automated Cars
Besides introducing automated driving systems under the brand of a single automobile
manufacturer or tech-ﬁrm alone, brand alliances are another option to consider. Brand
alliances have become more frequent in a wide variety of industries [40]. One of the most
signiﬁcant ﬁndings in brand alliance research is that an unknown or unfavorable brand can
beneﬁt from joining an alliance with a known and favorable brand [53, 61]. Brand
alliances consist of at least two brand entities. Horizontal and vertical brand alliances can
be distinguished [1]. Vertical brand allies play different roles in the value chain (e.g. Intel
as the supplier and Dell as the manufacturer), whereas horizontal brand allies belong to the
same industry or similar product category (e.g. Häagen-Dazs and Baileys). For the present
study, a vertical brand alliance between, e.g., an automobile brand and a tech-company is
proposed to be a realistic scenario, as more and more alliances between car manufacturers
and tech-companies have been announced in the media [32, 37]. Differences in purchase
intentions depending on the presence/absence of a brand alliance of a strong/weak
automobile manufacturer brand with a strong tech-brand will be assessed.
32.3.3 Use Cases of Automated Driving and Their Effects
on Purchase Intention
As mentioned above, the National Highway Trafﬁc Safety Administration (NHTSA) dis-
tinguishes ﬁve levels of vehicle automation based on the proportion of driver vs. vehicle
control [63]. To assess potential differences in purchase intention, different use cases which
are comparable to automated driving on the fourth level of full self-driving automation are
considered. In detail, the ﬁrst study exposes the subjects to Interstate Pilot with Extended
Availability Through Driver. While the second study extends Study 1 by considering brand
alliances, two additional use cases are introduced in Study 3. The second use case is
Automated Valet Parking and reﬂects comparably lower levels of personal physical risk
and lower levels of personal autonomy loss. The third use case is on the ﬁfth level of the
NHTSA typology and suspends the driver from driving. The vehicle is a Vehicle on
Demand. It is expected that the third use case is evaluated most critically, as it could
involve higher levels of personal physical risk and a restraint of personal autonomy.

Sample Description
The proposed model is split into a series of three studies and tested via an online consumer
survey among members of an online panel provider. The sample was selected based on the
requirements of holding a valid driver license, possession of a car, and comparability in
terms of gender and age according to the German population between 18 and 70. Prior to
the manipulation, respondents were asked to name the brand and model of the car that they
would use primarily. In addition, they were questioned about their involvement in cars in
general and had to indicate their familiarity with and attitude towards the brand(s) used in
the respective scenario. Each subject was then randomly assigned and confronted with only
one scenario. An Interstate Pilot was featured as automated driving system in the ﬁrst two
studies. Study three explicitly examines how consumers perceive alternative use cases
(Automated Valet Parking, Vehicle on Demand). After exposure to one of the scenarios,
respondents were asked to indicate their purchase intention for the optional automated
driving system. Next they were asked to rate several factors that were hypothesized to be
either positively or negatively related to their intention to consider the Interstate Pilot on
offer. The survey concluded with manipulation checks, a self-assessment of the respon-
dents driving capabilities, stress perception, subjective feelings about safety in trafﬁc, and
socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. The ﬁnal sample contains 545
responses. 55.2 % of the respondents are male, the average age of the respondents is 42.83
(standard deviation (SD) = 12.62).
32.5
Study 1
32.5.1 Study Design, Data Collection, and Measures
The ﬁrst study attempts to test the effects of brand equity on consumer acceptance using a
laboratory experimental design, in which we asked respondents to read a ﬁctitious press
release indicating the announcement of Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability. In order to isolate potential effects of brand equity differences (i.e., strong vs.
weak brands) and potential differences in credibility of the actors (i.e., automobile ﬁrms
vs. new market entrants), different press releases for different players were designed.
A 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design was constructed in which the different
scenarios only differ in terms of the selected brand, while everything else is held constant.
Figure 32.1 shows the press release used in the ﬁrst study.
In total, 239 respondents took part in Survey 1. The participants are roughly equally
distributed across the two additional scenarios. Cell-sizes ranged from 49 to 65 respondents
and no differences in age and gender distribution were found across cells. To test if the
manipulations of different levels of brand equity and competence of the industry actors
were perceived differently by the respondents, manipulation checks were conducted. To
examine if the respondents perceived the brands differently, brand attitude was measured as
32
Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …
693
the manipulation check variable. Brand attitude reﬂects the favorability and strength of
brand associations, one of the two dimensions of brand equity. As automobile brands
generally perform well in brand awareness (recall or recognition) scores, brand attitude is a
more reliable variable to measure differences in brand equity. Brand attitude was measured
with three items, capturing the favorability, likability, and performance of the brand.
Results reveal signiﬁcant differences between the strong (mean value (MV) = 5.40;
SD = 1.44) and weak (MV = 4.55; SD = 1.55) car manufacturer brands (p < 0.05) and the
strong (MV = 5.54; SD = 0.99) and weak (MV = 3.75; SD = 1.79) technology brands
(p < 0.01). In addition to the manipulations, brand possession and differences in individual
innovativeness were included as co-variables. The dependent variable purchase intention
was measured with three items indicating each individual’s likelihood to purchase/consider
a car with the particular brand and Interstate Pilot (for the indicated price of €3500). The
price was set in analogy to current prices for combined systems for assisted driving. The
scale displays excellent reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.94).
To explain the reasons for varying levels of purchase intentions, several proposed
drivers and barriers were measured on a perceptual level. Respondents were asked to
evaluate the proposed value of the system (i.e., convenience). In addition, functional trust,
price/value ratio, and prestige were included as mediators. These mediators are inﬂuenced
by autonomy perceptions, autonomy preference, privacy concerns, safety and security
perceptions, and brand attitude. The model also controls for brand possession and if
respondents considered themselves to be early or late adopters of innovations. The results
of the conﬁrmatory factor analyses (CFA) suggest valid and reliable scales. In addition,

the discriminant validity of the constructs was assessed [24]. The average variance
extracted (AVE) for each construct exceeds the shared variance with all other constructs.
Hence, we conclude sufﬁcient reliability and validity for the measures in this study. The
measurement properties and scale items are available upon request.
32.5.2 Results
On average, intentions to purchase the optional Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability are evaluated to be modest (MV = 3.30; SD = 1.81), a ﬁnding which in line
with generally high skepticism towards the adoption of innovations. From the 239
respondents who were confronted with one of the four scenarios, a total of 17.2 %
indicates high or very high intentions to purchase the featured automated driving system.
However, more than a third of the respondents (39.1 %) of the sample replied that they
would be (highly) unlikely to adopt this system in the near future. These ﬁndings indicate
that there is a signiﬁcantly sized market segment of early adopters but reveals acceptance
problems at the same time. Therefore, the next step assesses whether these ﬁndings differ
depending on the provider’s brand equity and industry sector.
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the hypothesized effects.
The ANOVA results show a signiﬁcant main effect for brand equity (p < 0.01), and
non-signiﬁcant effects for the industry sector of the ﬁrm (i.e., automobile manufacturer vs.
tech company) and the interaction term. In addition, differences in individuals’ general
innovation afﬁnity and car possession signiﬁcantly explain differences in the observed
levels of purchase intention. The effects of the manipulations on purchase intention are
displayed in Fig. 32.2.
The ﬁndings indicate that purchase intention is inﬂuenced by brand equity, irrespective
of the afﬁliation of the respective company to the sector of automobile manufacturers or
tech-companies. The values for the strong automobile brand (MV = 3.67; SD = 1.91) and
the strong tech-brand (MV = 3.63; SD = 1.70) are on a similar level. In a similar vein, the
difference in purchase intentions for the comparably weaker automobile brand
(MV = 3.01; SD = 1.81) and the weaker tech brand (MV = 2.88; SD = 1.82) is
insigniﬁcant as well.
To shed light on the relative impact of antecedents of purchase intention, a structural
equation model was estimated. The results reveal that functional trust is the most relevant
driver of purchase intention (ß = 0.432; p < 0.01), followed by the perceived convenience
of the described interstate pilot (ß = 0.237, p < 0.01). The other mediators are signiﬁcant,
but less important (price-value ratio ß = 0.124, p < 0.05; symbolic value ß = 0.117,
p < 0.05; and general innovation afﬁnity ß = 0.169, p < 0.01). In total 67.9 % in variance
of purchase intention are explained.
Functional trust is signiﬁcantly and positively inﬂuenced by safety and security per-
ceptions (ß = 0.383, p < 0.01), perceived autonomy (ß = 0.327, p < 0.01), general
innovation afﬁnity (ß = 0.163, p < 0.01), and brand attitude (ß = 0.130, p < 0.01).
32
Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …
695
Autonomy preference is signiﬁcantly negatively related to purchase intention (ß = −0.138,
p < 0.01). Contrary to expectations, differences in privacy concerns are not signiﬁcantly
related to purchase intention (ß = 0.012, p > 0.1). These factors explain a total of 71.8 % in
variance of functional trust. The key value proposition of Interstate Pilot is positively
affected by respondents’ perceptions of autonomy (ß = 0.598, p < 0.01), and negatively by
autonomy preference (ß = −0.298, p < 0.01). Brand attitude (ß = 0.238, p < 0.01) is
positively related to convenience perception, while all other factors remain insigniﬁcant.
The antecedents explain 63.3 % in variance of convenience. Similarly, the price-value
ratio is strongly affected by autonomy (ß = 0.450, p < 0.01) and autonomy preference
(ß = −0.122, p < 0.05). Moreover, innovation-oriented consumers evaluate the price-value
ratio more favorably (ß = 0.241, p < 0.01). Brand attitude is also positively related to
price-value perceptions (ß = 0.131, p < 0.05). A total of 42.8 % in variance of price-value
ratio are explained by the model. Symbolic value is signiﬁcantly affected by differences in
brand attitude (ß = 0.575, p < 0.01), explaining a total of 33.1 % in variance.
The results of the ﬁrst study offer relevant insights into the drivers of purchase intention
of Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability. Prior to convenience, functional
trust is seen as the most critical factor affecting consideration of the system. Besides
promoting the central value proposition (i.e., convenience value), marketing managers
should emphasize the perceptions of safety, security, and autonomy, since these variables
are indirectly related to the key outcome variable, purchase intention. Strong brands can
promote the adoption of automated driving on highways, as differences in brand attitude
are positively related to symbolic value, price-value perceptions, convenience, and
functional trust. As shown above, the respondents were not found to distinguish between

automobile and tech-brands in general, but rather between strong and weak brands.
Hence, strong tech-brands like Apple or Google can signiﬁcantly endanger the position of
established manufacturers, especially those with weak brands. Therefore, Study 2 analyzes
if a weak (strong) automobile brand can beneﬁt from joining a brand alliance with a strong
tech brand.
32.6
Study 2
32.6.1 Study Design, Data Collection, and Measures
The second study attempts to test if consumer acceptance is different when the automated
driving system on offer is branded by the OEM and a technology partner, constituting a
brand-alliance. The brand alliance settings are compared to the results of the single-brand
strategies documented in Study 1. Similarly to Study 1, each respondent was exposed to
one of the two additional scenarios, in which we asked respondents to read a ﬁctitious
press release indicating the announcement of an Interstate Pilot Using Driver for Extended
Availability. The press release was modiﬁed by adding the second brand name into the
header and by integrating both brand names into the text.
The proposed model was tested via an online consumer survey among members of an
online panel provider. The same sample selection criteria were used as documented in
Study 1 above and the survey had the identical structure.
In addition to the participants in the ﬁrst study, 92 respondents took part in the survey
for Study 2. The participants were distributed roughly equally across the two additional
scenarios. Cell-sizes ranged from 45 to 47 respondents and no differences in age and
gender distribution were found across cells. Manipulation checks of brand attitude reveal
signiﬁcant differences (p < 0.01) between the strong automobile brand (MV = 5.35;
SD = 1.62) and the weak automobile brand (MV = 4.74; SD = 1.49). In addition, the tech
brand used in the brand-alliance scenarios is evaluated signiﬁcantly better than the weak
automobile brand, whereas the difference to the strong automobile brand is insigniﬁcant
(MV = 5.50; SD = 1.01).
Similarly to Study 1, purchase intention was measured with three items and the same
co-variables were included. The structural model was also replicated in order to identify
possible explanatory variables for the observed differences in purchase intention. The
measurement properties suggest valid and reliable scales.
32.6.2 Results
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to test the hypothesized effects.
The ANOVA results show a signiﬁcant main effect for co-branding (p < 0.01), and a
signiﬁcant effect of innovation afﬁnity on purchase intention. The results show a
32
Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …
697
signiﬁcant negative effect of co-branding on purchase intention. The dependent variable
drops from 3.67 to 2.67 (SD = 1.93) for the strong car brand, and from 3.01 to 2.78
(SD = 1.80) for the weak car brand. With regard to the results of the manipulation check,
these ﬁndings are against expectations. At least for the weak car-brand, positive sup-
porting effects of being linked to a more attractive tech-brand would have been plausible.
To analyze potential explanations for the observed effects, a structural equation model was
estimated. The results exhibit signiﬁcant differences to the model reported in Study 1. In
detail, functional trust plays an even more important role for purchase intention in the case
of a brand alliance between an automobile brand and a tech brand (ß = 0.747, p < 0.01).
Price-value ratio also shows a signiﬁcant effect on purchase intention (ß = 0.180,
p < 0.01), while all other remaining direct effects are insigniﬁcant. In addition, the impact
of safety and security perceptions on functional trust is larger in the brand-alliance setting
(ß = 0.550, p < 0.01). Autonomy perceptions also have a signiﬁcant but comparably
smaller effect on functional trust (ß = 0.208, p < 0.05).
These ﬁndings suggest that consumers’ evaluations of the automated driving system
are not improved by a co-branding strategy with a tech brand, which is evaluated similarly
or better relatively to the automobile brand. Rather, consumers form their purchase
intention based on the trustworthiness of the system, which is mainly inﬂuenced by their
safety and security concerns and the perception of autonomy. In the case of the strong car
brand, the safety and security of the automated driving system are evaluated signiﬁcantly
more negatively (p < 0.05) in a brand alliance with a tech brand (MV = 4.15; SD = 1.82)
relative to a single-brand strategy (MV = 4.94; SD = 1.65). For the weak car brand, this
effect is insigniﬁcant. Overall, the ﬁndings of Study 2 indicate that automobile manu-
facturers and technology ﬁrms such as Apple or Google need to emphasize the speciﬁc
beneﬁts of potential brand alliances. Consumers perceive such partnerships as riskier and
functional trust becomes a prerequisite of the adoption of automated driving systems.
In order to test the generalizability of these ﬁndings, Study 3 replicates Study 2 using
two alternative use cases of automated driving.

Study 3
32.7.1 Study Design, Data Collection, and Measures
The third study attempts to measure differential effects of alternative scenarios of auto-
mated driving, each branded with a weak or strong brand. In addition to the Interstate Pilot
Using Driver for Extended Availability used as stimulus in the ﬁrst and second study, two
scenarios reﬂecting low personal risk (Autonomous Valet Parking) and high personal risk
(Vehicle on Demand) were designed. Table 32.1 shows the press releases used in the third
study.
A strong and a weak OEM-brand were both used as single brands, constituting two
scenarios for each additional use-case. Similarly to studies 1 and 2, each respondent was
698

exposed to one of the four additional scenarios, in which the respondents were asked to
read a ﬁctitious press release indicating the announcement of Autonomous Valet Parking
or Vehicle on Demand.

Berlin (dpa). As [brand] announced today, an
optional module named ADR (“Automated
Driving Robot”) will be offered in the course
of the yearly car updates by the middle of
2015. The module will be offered for all car
models of [brand] and allows fully automated
driving on all German streets
The driver can simply leave the car at the
target destination and activate the APT system
via smartphone. APT will independently
search for a parking space at no charge within
a radius of 5 km. All driving functions will be
taken over by APT at a manually adjustable
speed of up to 30 km/h. “Drivers can directly
reach their targets in city centers, the car takes
care of the parking task,” said Herbert Mueller,
chairman of [brand]. After a business
appointment or a visit to a theater, the car can
be activated and ordered to any location via
smartphone. The car remains locked for third
parties throughout the process, with the
exemption of the Police
The communication between passenger and
car is realized by the navigation system. After
entering the target destination, the car is
moved automatically by the system, allowing
no steering actions by the passenger. Only the
target destination can be modiﬁed and an
emergency stop function allows a safe stop
and exit. All driving functions will be taken
over by ADX at a manually adjustable
speed of up to 160 km/h. “The driver
becomes a passenger and can use the time to
relax or for work,” said Herbert Mueller,
chairman of [brand]. “Our research has shown
that driving robots react more reliably in
dangerous situations than human drivers,”
Müller continued. Especially after a period of
inactivity, the danger of overreacting
passengers would be high, therefore [brand]
would consequently rely on fully automated
driving. Nevertheless, the engineers of
[brand] have also thought about emergency
situations. Passengers can intervene at any
time. The ADR will then approach a secure
stopping point
APT will be available by the middle of 2015
as an optional component for all car models
of [brand] for a price of €3500. “By
introducing fully automated parking, [brand]
provides a valuable contribution to stress
reduction when searching for scarce parking
spaces,” the car manager pointed out

Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …

The proposed model was tested via an online consumer survey among members of an
online panel provider. The same sample selection criteria were used as documented in
Studies 1 and 2 and the survey had the identical structure.
In total, 342 respondents constitute the sample for the third study. The participants are
roughly equally distributed across the six scenarios (three use cases * strong/weak brand).
Cell-sizes ranged from 49 to 65 respondents and no differences in age and gender dis-
tribution were found across cells. In accordance to the prior studies, purchase intention
was measured with three items and the same co-variables were included. The structural
model was also replicated in order to identify possible explanatory variables for the
observed differences in purchase intention. The measurement properties suggest valid and
reliable scales.
32.7.2 Results
The two additional use cases are perceived slightly differently relative to the Interstate
Pilot Using Driver for Extended Availability used in the studies 1 and 2. On average, the
intention to purchase a fully automated parking assistant is about similar (MV = 3.59;
SD = 1.93), whereas the fully automated driving robot receives signiﬁcantly lower
evaluations (MV = 2.97; SD = 1.83). A share of 18.6 % of the 113 respondents who were
asked to evaluate the fully automated parking assistant indicates very high or high
intentions to purchase the system. This is slightly higher than the 17.2 % of the
respondents which indicated a (very) high likelihood to purchase Interstate Pilot as fea-
tured in Study 1. The share of 38.9 % of the respondents stating that they are (very) likely
to refuse to buy the featured automated parking assistant is on the same level as the share
of skeptics in Study 1. As the comparison of the mean values of purchase intentions
already suggests, the share of respondents with (very) high intentions to purchase a fully
automated driving robot is much lower (10.9 %). Nearly half of the sample of 101
respondents stated that they are (highly) unlikely to purchase the featured system in the
near future. These ﬁndings point to differences in purchase intentions caused by the
different use cases. In a next step, the effects of the use case and of brand equity are
assessed in an ANOVA. The results reveal a signiﬁcant main effect of use case (p < 0.05),
while the main effects of brand equity and the interaction term remain insigniﬁcant.
To analyze potential explanations for the observed differences, a multi-group structural
equation model was estimated. The results exhibit signiﬁcant differences of the model
depending on the respective use case. More speciﬁcally, the relative importance of
functional trust (ß = 0.170, p < 0.1) and prestige (ß = 0.08, p > 0.1) are much lower or
insigniﬁcant in case of a fully automated parking assistant. The effect of price-value ratio
is slightly higher (ß = 0.146, p < 0.1) and innovation afﬁnity is much less relevant
(ß = 0.122, p < 0.1). The most relevant driver of purchase intention is perceived con-
venience (ß = 0.445, p < 0.01). The formation of functional trust, however, depends more
strongly on the evaluation of safety and security (ß = 0.469, p < 0.01) and autonomy
700

preference (ß = −0.165, p < 0.1), whereas all other antecedents remain at comparable
effect sizes. In addition, the evaluation of convenience as a central value proposition
depends more strongly on whether respondents value the autonomy obtained from
automated parking (ß = 0.640, p < 0.01) and if their general autonomy preference is high
(ß = −0.436, p < 0.01). In sum, the successful introduction of a fully automated parking
assistant primarily depends on a suitable communication of its convenience value. In
comparison to the other use cases, functional concerns play a less important role.
The intention to buy a fully automated driving robot depends strongly on functional
trust (ß = 0.477, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the perceived symbolic value is a more relevant
antecedent of purchase intention (ß = 0.254, p < 0.05), relative to the other two use cases.
The perception of convenience and the remaining antecedents are less relevant. The
evaluation of functional trust is formed differently than in the other two use cases. While
safety and security concerns show a weaker inﬂuence on functional trust (ß = 0.256,
p < 0.05), perceptions of autonomy (ß = 0.447, p < 0.01) and autonomy preference
(ß = −0.260, p < 0.01) reveal strong effects. The formation of convenience perceptions is
by far less dependent on the perception of autonomy (ß = 0.380, p < 0.01), but relies
signiﬁcantly more on autonomy preferences (ß = −0.394, p < 0.01). The results indicate
strong self-selection effects, as consumers preferring high degrees of autonomy will
refrain from purchasing a fully automated driving robot. In light of the low level of
purchase intention, this scenario appears to be unattractive for most respondents.
32.8
Discussion and Future Research
The results obtained from the three experimental studies offer valuable insights into
drivers of individuals’ purchase intention of automated cars. In contrast to the generally
positive values for usage intentions reported in a French study [51], the present analysis
reveals that Germans are—on average—quite skeptical towards automated driving tech-
nologies. As the two studies differ considerably in terms of the methodology applied and
the amount of information given to the respondents, an interpretation of differences on a
national level is not possible. However, every sixth respondent indicates very high or high
intentions to purchase Interstate Pilot or Autonomous Valet Parking, irrespective of the
limited information available. Every tenth person even considers high purchase intentions
for fully automated driving robots (vehicle on Demand) which were said to exclude the
passenger from any driving operations. These ﬁgures are comparable to other consumer
studies measuring consideration values for technology innovations before market intro-
duction. If the described systems are perceived as useful and reliable after their intro-
duction, acceptance ﬁgures are expected to rise over time.
Irrespective of the psychological value dimensions inﬂuencing purchase consideration
levels, differences in the general innovation afﬁnity partially explain why consumers
consider purchasing the featured automated driving systems. In addition, respondents with
high levels of autonomy preference react more negatively towards this technology.
32
Consumer Perceptions of Automated Driving Technologies …
701
Besides autonomy preference, differences in autonomy perception resulting from the use
cases also account for the observed variance in purchase intention. Providers of automated
cars must therefore carefully segment their target markets and keep non-automated car
offers for the conservative segments.
The remaining ﬁndings of the three studies and the resulting conclusions are sum-
marized in Table 32.2.
The present study also has several limitations, which can be seen as a venue for future
research. First, the empirical study was conducted based on a representative sample of the
German population according to age and gender distribution. However, respondents were
asked to indicate their purchase intention not relating to their currently owned car brand.
Instead, they were asked to state their purchase intention towards a speciﬁc offer of a
brand. Potential differences caused by brand possession and brand attitude were controlled
in the model. Nevertheless, future research should attempt to focus on speciﬁc car seg-
ments with the corresponding target group to obtain more realistic results. Second, the
nature of the laboratory experiment implies high levels of internal validity, but limited
external validity. Future studies should strive towards a more realistic and vivid com-
munication of the nature of automated driving, e.g., by using video stimuli rather than
press releases employed in the present article. Third, future research should study how
critical incidents resulting from automated driving are perceived by consumers and how
their perceptions interrelate with the involved brand. Fourth, the study should be repli-
cated in other settings (i.e., countries) to explore its boundary conditions.
Table 32.2 Summary of results and conclusions
Scope of analysis
Results
Implications
Brand equity and
ﬁrm sector
• Brand equity is positively related
to purchase intentions,
irrespective of the ﬁrms’
industry sector
• Strong technology brands could
reveal similar acceptance levels
and are therefore a threat to
existing automobile brands
Vertical brand
alliances
• Negative perception of brand
alliances
• Functional trust, which is mainly
inﬂuenced by safety and security
concerns, explains the negative
evaluation of vertical brand
alliances
• Functional trust is a core brand
asset of automobile brands
• Safety and security concerns
related to tech partners must be
solved prior to engaging in brand
alliances
Use case differences
• Interstate Pilot with
Extended
Availability
Through Driver
• Automated Valet
Parking
• Vehicle on Demand
• Consideration: 17.2 %, mainly
driven by functional trust and
convenience (case 1)
• Consideration: 18.6 %,
mainly inﬂuenced by
convenience (case 2)
• Consideration: 10.9 %, primarily
affected by functional trust and
symbolic value (case 3)
• Reliability concerns and the
perceptions of usefulness need
to be addressed
• Communication of beneﬁts
derived from the system
• Reliability and security concerns
are the main barriers,
communication of symbolic
beneﬁts suggested
