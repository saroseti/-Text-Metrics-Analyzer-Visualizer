📊 Text Metrics Analyzer & VisualizerAn advanced, high-performance tool for text corpus analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics calculation, and interactive data visualization. It extracts text from books (PDF/EPUB), processes word frequencies, and enables deep visual exploration through an interactive graphical interface.✨ Key FeaturesRobust Text Extraction: Converts PDF and EPUB files to plain text using PyMuPDF.Storage Efficiency: Data serialization in .msgpack format for high-speed processing, alongside .json for human readability.NLP Calculation Engine: Automatically computes essential text analysis metrics for entire document collections.Interactive Visualization (GUI): Graphical interface built with matplotlib featuring smart scrollbars, interactive metric selection, and dynamic charts (Vertical Bar, Pie, Horizontal Bar).Automatic Book Classifier: Groups documents into categories (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Programming) by analyzing the TF-IDF scores of specific keywords.Clean Software Architecture: Implemented using a hybrid MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for the console flow and MVP (Model-View-Presenter) for the graphical visualization.🧮 Calculated MetricsThe system processes and exports the following metrics for each text corpus:TF (Term Frequency): Frequency of terms per individual document.CF (Collection Frequency): Total frequency of a term across the entire book collection.DF (Document Frequency): Number of documents in which a specific term appears.IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): A measure of how much information a word provides, calculated as log(N / DF).TF-IDF: The relevance of a word in a specific document relative to the entire collection.Balanced Score: A custom mathematical metric defined as log(CF + 1) * DF^2, ideal for finding highly recurrent and evenly distributed keywords.📐 Architecture & Design PatternsThe code is structured to be highly scalable and maintainable, applying SOLID principles:MVC & MVP: The CLI flow uses Model-View-Controller, while the complex visualization window delegates its interface to a Model-View-Presenter to isolate UI state logic (PRESENTER.py).Strategy Pattern: Used in data serialization (JsonStrategy, MsgpackStrategy), allowing the swap of save/load algorithms at runtime.Facade Pattern: TextAnalysisModel acts as a facade that hides the complexity of mathematical calculations and file conversions from the Controller.🚀 Installation and Dependencies1. Clone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/text-metrics-analyzer.git](https://github.com/your-username/text-metrics-analyzer.git)
cd text-metrics-analyzer
2. Install DependenciesThis project requires Python 3.8 or higher. The core dependencies are:pymupdf (for PDF/EPUB text extraction)msgpack (for high-speed binary serialization)matplotlib (for generating the interactive GUI and charts)You can install all required packages at once using the requirements.txt file:pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the applicationpython MAIN.py
🎮 Interactive Menu GuideUpon running the program, you will be greeted by a terminal menu:[1/2] Path Management: Define the folder containing your PDF/EPUB books.[3/4] Conversion: Convert books to .txt and subsequently to .msgpack to optimize read speeds.[5/6] Compute Metrics: Calculate all mathematical formulas and export them to your desired format (JSON for debugging, Msgpack for performance).[7/8] Visualization Interface: Open the interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI).🖥️ Graphical Interface (GUI)Options 7 and 8 will open an interactive window where you can:Select the metric to visualize (CF, DF, IDF, Balanced Score, or Book Categories).Analyze the individual TF of each book by selecting it from an interactive radio-button menu.Switch between Bar, Pie, and Horizontal Bar charts.Define the number of variables to display using the "Show Top:" text box (e.g., Top 300 words).Navigate through massive datasets using the smart bottom Scrollbar (automatically activates when the bar chart gets too large).📂 Project Structure📁 text-metrics-analyzer/
